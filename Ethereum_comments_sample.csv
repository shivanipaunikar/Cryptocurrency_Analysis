"As Vitalik indicated, we have no idea where the 29.4% number came from.  Any speculations at this point are unfounded.  We are still working out budgets and other financial issues and have not finalized any numbers. 

We are acutely aware of the community sentiment regarding a possible pre-mine.  We are also weighing the value of having ETH to pay salaries which keeps our individual and corporate interests more completely aligned with those of Genesis Sale ETH buyers.  Whether there is a pre-mine or not, we will need to have lots of ETH on day one to pay out obligations (e.g. salaries to developers), to help fund third parties who are developing DApps on Ethereum, and possibly to help stabilize the currency in the early days.  We are looking at ways to reduce the pre-mine significantly and possibly even eliminate it.  If we do end up eliminating it or having a very small pre-mine, we will have to buy ETH in the market which creates other issues.

We certainly don't want the role of a central bank, but in the early days of bootstrapping the system, it may be prudent to ensure that the currency is stable while new businesses on the system are making their services available and figuring out the implementational details of their business models.  Some third parties have already indicated that they are interested in setting up trade desks to stabilize any currency fluctuations (and be paid for taking risks in these activities).  Such groups will likely assist ETH to remain in a non-volatile trading band and they will likely have other businesses that depend on an ETH price that is not excessively volatile.  In the event that there is not enough ETH liquidity at certain times and exchange rates rise rapidly, we may want to have a pool of readily available ETH that we can draw from to reduce drastic upward volatility and enable businesses on the system to operate economically while the economy grows and gains stability. Bootstrapping an economy will be an interesting endeavor.  We expect businesses on the system to figure things out, bottom up, grass roots.  But one thing they don't need to contend with is an excessively volatile ETH price, so we may step in on occasion to dampen large swings.

"I think if we're going to solve the ""voting online securely"" issue it's definitely going to come from a Bitcoin-inspired protocol. My hope is this will happen on Ethereum. But for now I'm very cautiously optimistic. I think there will be plenty of opportunities to test whether this will work or not, before we actually start using such a system in countries for voting.

If someone does try to make such a system, I hope they go with [range/score voting](http://rangevoting.org/). I've looked into the various types of voting a little, and range voting seems the most fair, and the one most likely one to determine the best candidate out of a race. 

I also think it forces us to think a little more rationally about the candidates in order to give them the proper ""grade"", rather than the very emotionally charged voting that we see now, with people voting Democrat because ""I'm a Democrat"", so I should support ""my team"", rather than who he thinks is the best candidate for the job overall.

With score voting you decide exactly how much a candidate is worth compared to others. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate the emotional factor (you could still give your favorite one a 9, and all the others a 0), but I think it does force you to think about it a little more than the ""white or black"" options we often see today in voting, and I believe it forces people to be more ""fair"" when giving each a score. 

Then we should see candidates that really deserve to win, because most people have a great opinion about them and think they will do a good/great job, rather than someone winning just because 51 percent hate the other candidate, even if they don't like this one that much either, and with minority candidates having zero chance in such a race, even if most people think they would be great (but they have to vote *strategically* for Big Party B, so they don't let Big Party A win).

Since the calculations will be done securely on the blockchain and automatically, it might finally be feasible and no harder than choosing any other voting system. 

If range voting is too complicated for some reason to do on a blockchain, because of its consensus mechanism, then [approval voting](http://www.electology.org/approval-voting) is the next best one, which is like a more simplistic version of the range voting. However, it's less accurate, because you ""approve"" several candidates *equally*, instead of giving them a fair grade. But it should still be a pretty good voting system, and I wouldn't mind seeing both compete in the voting market.

Rank voting is much worse than both, and I don't think it even deserves pursuing. It already exists in some countries like Australia I think, and it doesn't do a very good job at picking the right candidate, because it forces the decision to still be highly strategic (not a good thing).",0,t1_cfmi7uj,t3_1yp1nr,t3_1yp1nr,1393173860,,4,False,,1432521552,1393159653,[deleted],0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,4,,cfmi7uj,True,0

"Your comparison with Satoshi really isn't fair. Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem and brought a completely novel concept to widespread adoption, single-handedly. And even after all that, Satoshi doesn't seem to have spent any coin on himself, after all these years! If Satoshi ever spends his coin, I am sure he will spend the bulk of it for the good of humanity, rather than buying for himself mega-islands/yachts/planes/etc.

If Satoshi had baked into the protocol that even before mining, after 5 years he would get 43% of the bitcoins, you can bet bitcoin adoption wouldn't have been near as big as it was. And I'm sure someone would have forked it to make a fairer bitcoin, which would have grown more popular.

Now compare that with Ethereum. The team has 47 (!) people, is not nearly as big an incremental advance, and has competition already in the form of ColoredCoins, Counterparty, MasterCoin, etc. Granted the scripting idea seems the most advanced I have seen, but that doesn't mean it can't be implemented by others.

Is QM crypto not only too slow but also requires too many bits? 

Btw, hypothetically, I wonder ethereum could basically not implement public crypto? Well *not strictly*! A script can implement public key cryptography, and incorporate a public key into itself. Block winners could win the ability to enter such a script and fill it with some coin. People buying ether without a script, would initially also buy a initial script with pubkey. Pubkey crypto would be in the scripts.

I dont see a way to actually do such thing, of course, for one the bill for accessing would have to be paid by the script itself, but then it can be drained with DDOS. To solve that you could make scripts call a transaction invalid, but then DDOS potentially can attack the network itself.

Also submitting new scripts would have to be done, or 'approved and funded' by scripts aswel. And, of course, it is inefficient.

People have been using loopholes for as long as they existed. So even if you get this as bulletproof as possible on the Ethereum side, there is no guarantee that someone can't twist sales figures or something similar.

This is especially the case if your sales figures are kept off of the blockchain (and I imagine for the vast majority of companies for any reasonable period of time this will be the case). How does the blockchain know if sales figures have been reached except by information provided by an outside source? How do you make sure they are accurate and honest?

Other ways of measuring productivity are even more difficult. Is a programmer efficient or more productive the week they pound out 100 lines of refactored code vs the week they removed 10 lines of code and had a mental breakthrough?

"I think I understand what you mean. I believe the complete opposite, I think Ethereum is going to reduce scams if not eliminate them altogether. 

First, it's currently impossible to obfuscate contract code, so all contracts will be in clear text. Anyone pretending to create a contract and not delivering on its promise (frontend/backend schism) would be immediately flagged a scam both by the users of the said site AND on chain. Just like if amazon kept 33% of the credit card numbers to buy themselves fancy paintings, I think we'd know. Ethereum is about to add decentralized, Sybil attack proof reputation systems on top of all that. 

Second, in order to be trustless and decentralized most if not all contracts of an 'escrow' nature would have to have 100% if not more collaterals attached to them, on both sides. Hard to scam if users automatically get their money back.

Third unlike the financial derivates in today's financial world, derivatives in Ethereum would be backed by Ether, or even Bitcoin, and not debt. Good as gold.

Fourth Ethereum makes the building of such services so trivial than consumers will never have been in such a powerful position to 'vote with their feet'. Worrying that someone could scam others with Ethereum is the same as worrying that someone could ask for a cc number on a website today, then disappear the day after. Ethereum will create an ecosystem where anyone acting without proper escrows, total transparency and 100% honesty will be out of business in no time.

The namecoin issue could fairly easily be fixed, a namecoin contract could do ranges of namespaces, you could buy a range and send an address to a script instead to some piece of data. The script controls that bit of namespace by its output, or state.

DAO investments can be held up, firstly for any interaction, you can apply reputation/stake systems(which havent been developed yet either) which could be used between developers and investors.(question in that is if the developers have enough reputation to wield) Secondly, there are all sorts of ways of attaching things onto the DAO script itself;

* It may need starting reputation/stake, 
* Need to buy a name in a namecoin, and perhaps other interactions with other scripts. 
* The wages of the developers can be encoded.

The developers cannot run away without losing the investment in the script, and the script may contain a feature where investors can vote to cancel and return some of their money, or there may be a timeout system.

DAOs can be rather nebulous.. is Namecoin is not that much investment to write..(though i suppose we might want to think about how to do that thing best we can) Probably a reputation/stake DAO would be similarly nebulous. Tbh i am not sure if i would call them organizations. (automatons?)

"Probably all contracts still have to be figured out or further refined. It is a platform or a cryptocurrency and contracts. Contract writers have to figure out things that work economically, and popularize it!

The namecoin issue could fairly easily be fixed, a namecoin contract could do ranges of namespaces, you could buy a range and send an address to a script instead to some piece of data. The script controls that bit of namespace by its output, or state. Maybe someone(the ethereum team?) might want to add a namecoin contract particularly to start off the tree of namecoin contracts, set a consensus point to start that off. (it would be a pita if browsers have to figure out from which namecoin that link is coming)

DAO investments can be held up, firstly for any interaction, you can apply reputation/stake systems(which havent been developed yet either) which could be used between developers and investors.(question in that is if the developers have enough reputation to wield) Secondly, there are all sorts of ways of attaching things onto the DAO script itself;

* It may need starting reputation/stake, 
* Need to buy a name in a namecoin, and perhaps other interactions with other scripts. 
* The wages of the developers can be encoded.

The developers cannot run away without losing the investment in the script, and the script may contain a feature where investors can vote to cancel and return some of their money, or there may be a timeout system. (Of course the development may be about developing the script itself, the script invested in would then just contain the investment features initially)

DAOs can be rather nebulous.. is Namecoin is not that much investment to write..(though i suppose we might want to think about how to do that thing best we can) Probably a reputation/stake DAO would be similarly nebulous. Tbh i am not sure if i would call them organizations. (automatons?)

"Neo &amp; Bee have given us another unfortunate reminder of the importance of trustless security. I inquired to learn about the best practices that Ethereum can use during their pre-sale and Vitalik was kind enough to respond:

&gt;vbuterin
&gt;
&gt;The pre-sale is blockchain-based, and I have a python script that will be released alongside the other sale materials that will list the table of all purchases. If the genesis block does not match this table, then it will be trivial to notice this. In fact, we may even opt to have pyethereum generate the genesis block directly from the purchases taken from the BTC blockchain.

If you guys do run a trustless pre-sale, It would set a wonderful precedent.

I'll have to lament here, but it sounds like all purchases with BTC will be transparent in the blockchain, the exchange rate for each purchase will also be transparent, and the genesis block will show that all purchased ether has been generated.

There's just one more important step: ether collection. Will an escrow function be used to hold BTC until ether has been generated/etc. (according to some predefined terms), and will investors be able to collect their investment using a private key?

"Arguing against a pre-mine makes sense if you're talking about nothing more than a fork of bitcoin with slight code modifications. After all, what have you really done to earn a pre-mine? But unfortunately this hardline stance on pre-mine has become a standard meme to unthinkingly repeat. Ethereum is starting from an entirely new codebase. A team had to be organized - all of the code has to be written, tested, and audited. There will be many other costs - legal fees, salaries, etc...  

This isn't a simple fork of an already existing coin - it's an IPO of a project which happens to have a decentralized monetary instrument as part of its product. 

If we applied this ""absolutely no pre-mine"" mentality to anything else it would be apparent that your stance makes no sense - let's use farming for an example. 

If we treated farming the way you're treating the ethereum pre-mine we would expect the farmer to buy the land, hire the workers, plow the fields, plant the seed, grow the plants, harvest the crop, and do any other work necessary. Then, instead of getting any of the harvest for himself, or any discount on the vegetables, you scream ""unfair!"" and demand that the farmer put the entire harvest into a huge pile which you and the farmer and everyone else in the town have an equal chance of getting food from. 

This isn't fair. This isn't logical. This makes no sense. We can't expect that people should do massive amounts of work and then compete on equal footing with those who didn't for a piece of the same pie.

"I agree that the readability will probably become a key feature. Every single line of my code is commented because if it wasn't I would never have been able to remember what i was doing halfway through!

That said. The assumption that a more efficient contract will be a more honest one is not completely valid. I discovered while doing this that the best way to increase efficiency in these contracts is to order the logical statements in order of nested constraints (so you don't need to check something multiple times) and then in terms of most likely to occur. 

Admittedly these are just minor improvements for this contract because I'm still learning but one example is that a tie game is far more likely then a winner in tictactoe. so at one point I checked if it was a tie game first in order to avoid having to check if player 1 won or player 2 won since those are far less likely.

Relating this back to the discussion. All ""Admin"" powers are located at the end of the contract because they will almost never be used . as such they also won't affect the efficiency of the rest of the program but i could have easily written an admin power that lets me change the game board of a particular game.

Of course there should be ways to detect this... maybe? The problem as I see it. Ethereum has validated what was supposed to happen. as far as the network is concerned this is how things should be. so without reading the code and checking for a backdoor... i'm not sure how you could do it. This program is only 250 lines long But you could easily envision a much longer contract that has a tiny clause around line 892 which allows you to do all kinds of bad things.

for example:

(when (= (txsender) &lt;Your address here&gt;) (suicide (txsender))

That one line would make it possible for you to define a special account which would steal all funds in the contract and destroy the contract.
That could be pretty hard to catch even in the most readable programs...

(Note my tictactoe game has suicide capabilities given to the admin simply because when i was testing this i didn't want to leave a bunch of contracts around with usable funds in them!

Block winners could win the ability to enter such a script and fill it with some coin. People buying ether without a script, would initially also buy a initial script with pubkey. Pubkey crypto would be in the scripts.

I dont see a way to actually do such thing, of course, for one the bill for accessing would have to be paid by the script itself, but then it can be drained with DDOS. To solve that you could make scripts call a transaction invalid, but then DDOS potentially can attack the network itself.

"The ""premine"" will limit Ethereum's success.

I just watched Charlie Lee's great [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le5ByHtssnc) why he created Litecoin and why he thinks it succeeded. There were two reasons for LTC. Just 2 blocks mined by the developer (he claims he mined the first block to test if everything runs properly) and a great simple name. Ethereum fails in both areas.
I was at an event last weekend and told ten people in person about Ethereum. None of them could get the spelling of Ethereum right, just by hearing the name, when I recommend them to write down a note about Ethereum. And once they will learn about the premine they won't invest.

"*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Zipf's law***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law) : 

---

&gt;**Zipf's law** /ˈzɪf/, an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics, refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. The law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950), who first proposed it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though the French stenographer Jean-Baptiste Estoup (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf. It was also noted in 1913 by German physicist Felix Auerbach (1856–1933).

"Neo &amp; Bee have given us another unfortunate reminder of the importance of trustless security. I inquired to learn about the best practices that Ethereum can use during their pre-sale and Vitalik was kind enough to respond:

&gt;vbuterin
&gt;
&gt;The pre-sale is blockchain-based, and I have a python script that will be released alongside the other sale materials that will list the table of all purchases. If the genesis block does not match this table, then it will be trivial to notice this. In fact, we may even opt to have pyethereum generate the genesis block directly from the purchases taken from the BTC blockchain.

If you guys do run a trustless pre-sale, It would set a wonderful precedent.

I'll have to lament here, but it sounds like all purchases with BTC will be transparent in the blockchain, the exchange rate for each purchase will also be transparent, and the genesis block will show that all purchased ether has been generated.

There's just one more important step: ether collection. Will an escrow function be used to hold BTC until ether has been generated/etc. (according to some predefined terms), and will investors be able to collect their investment using a private key?

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain). So note that nTransactions and nBlocks is going to be at least linear in time (just like Bitcoin) but the contract memory requirements (the most radical change in scalability characteristics from Bitcoin) is proportional to the number of contracts but does not necessarily continually grow over time. (If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world. The trick is discovering the right fees. The current plan seems to be to pull the numbers out of a hat, this seems deeply unsatisfactory to me, we should come up with a market mechanism for price discovery.",0,t1_cfhm9wc,t3_1y5df7,t3_1y5df7,False,,5,False,,1432437149,1392662295,cogware,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,5,,cfhm9wc,True,0

"&gt; Why would you donate bitcoins, if you need them later to purchase ethereum.

I'm not sure what you mean. I was suggesting it in the vein that if the fundraiser model went forward I was thinking of putting in something like $200. However, if it was donations they were seeking, I'd put in $100, even if I wasn't getting any ether or return back. That's more money for the devs that they can use however they want.

&gt; Also what happens when the donation drive fails, then ethereum has to come back with the IPO model.

Very valid. I framed it that way but another thing is if you felt confident enough with the donation scheme you could just rely on that and not even have the fallback.

But it could just be a way to test the waters. Some Kickstarters (not technically donations) raise hundreds of thousands or millions more than expected. I don't think that is a crazy possibility, and again, these would be donations, so the devs would get 100%, not the cut they are looking at now.

"(right.. probably a lot of people dump a lot of ideas near you.. sorry if i am one of the pointless ones.. I should get on the test-blockchain/look at scripts)

One thing i wondered about, isnt proof of stake essentially effortless, the slasher^[link](http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/) algo being there to actual punish the otherwise costless condoning of incorrect or 'loser' blocks.

But since it is effortless, why not have multiple PoS chains. To mine, you wouldnt in principle need to be full client to notice if you see that you are below the score of `checksum(append(X,own_wallet_address))`, where `X=checksum(append(previous_hash_of_block,random_number_of_slasher_of_block))` all you would need is the list of those `X`.

You would need to have to see if the blockchain you won in is actually correct, and you may be punished later by some mechanism like slasher if it isnt. Preferably winner nodes would have time somehow to make themselves full-node regarding that chain or use partial-lightweight clients.(the latter difficult to implement?) I should look at Nxts transparent forging thingy..

And something is needed to transfer coins between blockchains. Could be that you'd just rely on both lightweight clients regarding a lot of them, or you'd need a system of automatic coinswaps, where people tell they client with hot coins to participate..

"Presenter here.  The funder acceptance test (FAT) was half-baked.  The funders probably won't know the profit margin of the entrepreneur.  Instead of returning profit they could demand a multiple of the prize as the non-performance penalty.

The issue of gaming the FAT was discussed in the Q&amp;A where the project initiator funds more than half as a disguised donor in an effort to do nothing and rubberstamp the FAT.  The FAT can be gamed, but payoff to the scammer is less than an assurance contract without FAT.

It's also pretty obvious to me that excludable public goods, like a bridge with tolls for non-funders incentivizes better than pure public goods.  Also I prefer the escrow model, with perhaps some way of investing the funds during the campaign to offset opportunity costs.  Under the pledge system no opportunity cost is incurred but one must be sure that all donors honor their pledges (trustful).

Vitalik has a post about the model on the Ethereum forums.

"The base claim here is quite interesting: that tx fees - even in Bitcoin - aren't just a simple trade between the tx sender and a miner, where the sender pays BTC to a miner and the miner processes the (perhaps extra large) transaction. But rather that the rest of the network ""must"" also bear the costs. 

Thus if blocksize were uncapped, the argument goes, miners would process big transactions that are profitable for them (because they receive the entire fee, which exceeds their own costs) but a net loss for the network as a whole (because the cost to the network exceeds the fee). Thus ""tx fees are not a market"" because there's a ""tragedy of the commons.""

One reservation I have is that it's not actually the case that other nodes must bear the cost. They have a choice whether to relay larger transactions and they can set their own blocksize limits. If it becomes unprofitable for the rest of the network to deal in larger blocks, the miners that do will find themselves isolated, will they not? 

More generally, for their to be a tragedy of the commons there needs to be a commons - that is, a rivalrous resource that everyone can consume and that no one can restrict the consumption of. 

For example an unowned lake around which is a ring of houses. If everyone can freely fish the lake, overfishing will destroy it. But the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum seems different: the network node resources seem less like the lake and more like the resources within the houses themselves, where if you allow your house space and tools to be used by others you get to use everyone else's (you get to participate in the HouseShare system). Critically, this does *not* make the housing spaces and tools a commons, because if one is too greedy in their use of other people's things they may simply find themselves cut off from the system by other homeowners.

"Afaik ethereum can do basically everything the others can do. The others largely have features that arent really up my alley.(but i think i should learn more about the financial ideas behind them)

The main weakness of ethereum is essentially the full-scripting thing, which people often think is prone to bugs. Though it it definitely something to really try hard to keep secure,(which bit of cryptocurrencies arent..) I am not too worried about it. Javascript has had and probably has a lot of security bugs, but interfaces with a lot, ethereum script basically interfaces with stuff that ethereum developpers *also* made, and with a lot less, i reckon.

The second worry/weakness is that the computation and storage of contracts is just too much data to hold on to. Which would hurt volume it can handle, and/or drive the cost of fees up. This one is basically the main worry i have, despite the good lightweight-client thing. That said, if i can be sure there are enough full-nodes out there and the lightweight-client thing works, might already suffice.

Afaik the mechanisms the blockchain works with, the mining etcetera is not exactly set in stone. Fairly confident they're going the right direction. (but not through knowing the direction myself)

The possibilities of the ethereums scripts are enormous, and they are just being explored. Escrow without third party, crowdfunding, subcurrencies, namecoin, dropbox, 'serving and viewing'(not sure of that, dont get responses about it :) ), self-enforcing contracts, (like)self-enforcing rules for organizations, approaches to identify persons to try figure out how to do UBI.

Btw i use the word scripts.. Heard the word (self-enforcing-/smart-)contracts used too, but the problem is that the word contract doesnt always quite fit the bill, script is fairly accurate, but it carries connotations.

"The problem with any discussion in the cryptocurrency space is the prevalence of Austrian-school terminology, and the general confusion as to what deflation and inflation mean.

Just to avoid confusion, let's use inflation/deflation to refer to price changes strictly, without talking about the quantity of money available.

So what does it mean to say that Ethereum (or Bitcoin) is deflationary? The argument goes something like this; the supply of money is increasing linearly (or sublinearly), but the demand for money is exponential, as more goods appear, and the number of people increase.  Therefore, over time, the value of money will increase, thus leading to deflation.

The problem with this argument is the claim about the growth of the supply of money.  This is only true with an incredibly restrictive definition of money supply; basically limited to M0.  Even there, M0 is no good since it includes ""guaranteed"" deposits (usually with a central bank).  So really, we're making the claim that the money supply is equivalent to the supply of specie.

The problem is that the actual amount of money circulating in an economy is a market phenomenon, because metrics of money supply have to take into account credit markets.  At the moment, neither Ethereum nor Bitcoin have even rudimentary credit markets, so this is not as much of a factor.

But if either coin is successful, credit markets will evolve -- people with money will seek to increase their money by purchasing cash-like instruments (demand deposits, savings accounts, bonds, stocks, real estate); which allows the actual specie to circulate, while simultaneously allowing them to ""keep"" the money based on the liquidity of the instruments, and earning interest on the money in the meantime.

So, in short, I don't buy the argument that either coin is deflationary.  At best we can say that it is long-term deflationary, but even there we need a ridiculous number of assumptions to make that claim.",0,t1_cgegzwo,t3_21l7rw,t3_21l7rw,False,,2,False,,1433112816,1396043050,andrewla,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cgegzwo,True,0
"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it""  I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.  

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward.  Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

We don't need a Crypto-Microsoft. In fact, we don't need a crypto-Google. We need many competitors and honest competition...otherwise we probably wont like what happens 15-20 years down the road.

Just MHO, take it or leave it, but it is here with the sole intent of providing a non-biased look at things in this space.  I like MasterCoin (dont own them unfortunately), wish I trusted Hoskinson and the other team members who fail to acknowledge those from whom they wish to win the Championship Belt so I could feel good about Ether, and I own a small amount of PTS/AGS.  Longterm holder because I love the Devs, community and await the first Decentralized Bank in Keyhotee Free Space...

Cool stuff coming in the Bitcoin 2.0 space...hope more ethical versions come around.  I'm liking the prospects.

"&gt; The fact is that the modern world is very different from that past 6000 years in two key ways: increased interdependence between geographic regions, and increased dependence on uncapturable capital (social networks). IMO, both of these together make international warfare essentially nonviable. Now more non-intrusive mechanisms like cyberwarfare, product sabotage and financial warfare, those I can see continuing to play out; in fact, one could argue that many countries are currently engaging in financial warfare against each other right now.

It's nice to hear your views on wider social implications, Vitalik, thanks for taking the time. But this above is overly optimistic, and basic globalisation discourse at that, you must admit: globalisation or distributed power-production networks have long proven themselves to be as much if not more of an exacerbater of transnational hegemonies (military, financial, legal, labour, ...) than they are a force for radical emancipation. All powerful financial-governmental institutions openly subvert their own legal taxation frameworks to off-shore their profits. All belligerant nation-states unsubtly wage their wars assymetrically via unending series of so-called humanitarian interventions. All multi-national corporations worthy of their name exploit cheap, developing nation labour costs. In this sense hegemonic power has been leading and innovating the decentralisation game for decades: far from ""nonviable"" it's vital to its own continuation, as means of re-producing itself. It's imperative not to be naive on how this works.

That said, I am cautiously optimistic about projects like Ethereum as it potentially lowers the entry requirements for autonomous contract production. Relatively small organisations may be enabled to compete with hegemonic institutions at their own game. But what's essential for this to be genuinely emancipatory is for such contract production frameworks to be wedded to non-reactionary political programs, otherwise it will inevitably lapse into exploitative discourse yet again -- only at a microeconomic scale.

"The miners will enter into the market but with much less funds slowly over time. And the Investor could sell a few for a high price, the demand will be very high if too many people get locked out of the IPO. Its not only that extreme case, if 3 or 5 ""big players"" will buy in the IPO can be finished in 1 minute. I would hate to not be able to buy in because the servers can not handle so much requests and then the IPO is closed because the cap is reached.
But beside that I think for the future development that power concentration would be very bad. The ether funds of the founders are time-locked so they cannot influence the market, the miners will need much time to create funds and if supply is too low the price will skyrocket, driving more people into mining and makes investment in mining very high, so the price and mining cost will be in an equilibrium. If the monopolistic investor decide one day to cash out the miners will suffer a lot from a price crash and the whole ethereum project could be attacked in such a way. I dont say that it is very realistic but it is a threat and should be provented. There are many investors with a lot of millions out searching for BTC projects, so I would not be too surprised if the IPO would be over too soon for a wide community to participate.

"Conference, Alpha Testnet and Fundraiser Updates

January 29, 2014 - By Team

Ethereum received an incredible response at the Miami Bitcoin Conference. We traveled there anticipating many technical questions as well as a philosophical discussion about the purpose of Ethereum; however, the overwhelming amount of interest and enthusiasm for the project was much larger than we had anticipated. Vitalik’s presentation was met with both a standing ovation and a question queue that took hours to address.

Because we intend on providing an equal opportunity to all those who want to be involved, and are reviewing the relevant logistical and regulatory issues for a fundraiser of this scale, we have decided to postpone the Feb 1 launch of the fundraiser. We will make the announcement of the new fundraiser launch date on our official website: Ethereum.org.

The Ethereum project is also excited to announce the alpha release of the open source testnet client to the community at the beginning of February. This will give people an opportunity to get involved with the project and experiment with Ethereum scripts and contracts, and gain a better understanding of the technical properties of the Ethereum platform. Launching the testnet at this date will give those interested in the fundraiser a chance to better understand what the Ethereum project is about before participating.

The testnet will include full support for sending and receiving transactions, the initial version of the scripting language as described in our whitepaper, and may or may not include mining. This will also be the first major cryptocurrency project to have two official clients released at the same time, with one written in C++ and the other in Go; a Python client is also in the works. A compiler from the Ethereum CLL to Ethereum script will be released very soon.

A note on security

The fundraiser will NOT be launching on February 1st and any attempt to collect funds at this time should be considered a scam.

I am sure some dusty-minded engineers are thinking they're doing it for efficiency. Cant help but wonder if they looked at youtube videos crossing, that is going to be a lot of data..

Whats the status of FOSS/software activist groups trying to affect/do HTTP development? Could there be any way to both be able to cache and have it anonymous?(seems unlikely, but.. crypto is very wtf)

So basically https the private key is at the server, but they mitm it because the certificate authority can say 'this pubkey is good too', and then a intermediate server uses https, and then retransmits with a different privkey. One way around this could be to just start a separate certificate authority? Edit: that wouldnt help, the browser would just tell you it doesnt trust the pubkey, not give you a way around.. You could add another layer of encryption, so then they would have to add another layer of mitm, haha.

Btw should use [Tor](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/), btw. That said, even when using tor-to-clearnet, this would decrease privacy a tiny bit, as the exit node and snoopers beyond it can see more.(darknet is unaffected by this) Of course, it is *much* less efficient for internet traffic. Note: wikipedia mentions https being developped for tor nodes.. I think they mean the *exit* nodes can enter malicious stuff, the intermediate ones can only tell where it came from and where to send it.(But not where the subsequent node will send it)

People already thought of fake searches to decrease tracking.(when i saw it, it was poorly implemented) Fake browsing is also possible. Main problem is how to do all the thing the browser does without showing the user anything, and how to figure out the 'real' links.

"We will be releasing a huge amount of information in advance of the pre-sale.  All of your questions will be answered in great detail, hopefully to your satisfaction.

That said, I can answer a couple of your issues briefly.

The bulk of the pre-mine is a long-term endowment for the project.  Employee compensation and other expenses will be paid in combinations of ETH, BTC and legacy currency to be specified by the employee.  Most personnel are eager to receive a significant percentage of ETH as part of their regular compensation.  We will be running a radically open and transparent organization.  For instance, salaries will be formula-based and the formula will be published.

The long-term endowment will be released in tranches that are in time-locked contracts.

If you are holding ETH, it would be in your best interest if the company and its personnel were also holding ETH, and were actively working to increase the value of ETH.  Through this mechanism our interests are further aligned.


&gt; We have to trust you will do the right thing with those funds.

You also have to trust us to do the right thing with the BTC used to purchase ETH in the pre-sale.  Not sure how the pre-mine ETH requires more or different trust.

&gt; under what jurisdiction will the foundation operate under?  

&gt; Will a government who is bothered by Ethereum or any of its contracts/DACs go ahead and close the foundation thus hiting a hard blow?

Ethereum will have hubs in many places around the world.  Two major hubs will be in Switzerland and Canada. If either of those jurisdictions turns against cryptocurrencies, the organization will relocate that hub.

I am sure some dusty-minded engineers are thinking they're doing it for efficiency. Cant help but wonder if they looked at youtube videos crossing, that is going to be a lot of data..

Whats the status of FOSS/software activist groups trying to affect/do HTTP development? Could there be any way to both be able to cache and have it anonymous?(seems unlikely, but.. crypto is very wtf)

So basically https the private key is at the server, but they mitm it because the certificate authority can say 'this pubkey is good too', and then a intermediate server uses https, and then retransmits with a different privkey. One way around this could be to just start a separate certificate authority? Edit: that wouldnt help, the browser would just tell you it doesnt trust the pubkey, not give you a way around.. You could add another layer of encryption, so then they would have to add another layer of mitm, haha.

Btw should use [Tor](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/), btw. That said, even when using tor-to-clearnet, this would decrease privacy a tiny bit, as the exit node and snoopers beyond it can see more.(darknet is unaffected by this) Of course, it is *much* less efficient for internet traffic. Note: wikipedia mentions https being developped for tor nodes.. I think they mean the *exit* nodes can enter malicious stuff, the intermediate ones can only tell where it came from and where to send it.(But not where the subsequent node will send it)

People already thought of fake searches to decrease tracking.(when i saw it, it was poorly implemented) Fake browsing is also possible. Main problem is how to do all the thing the browser does without showing the user anything, and how to figure out the 'real' links.

"Um. From what you've written, it seems as though you're missing the point.

The issue isn't a fork of the *code*. If that were the issue, your argument would be right.

The issue is that people might set up a whole competing *block chain*, using essentially the *same* code. That's a completely different kind of ""fork"".

You could take a copy of the *exact* Ethereum code you guys produce, change a few parameters, and have it running on an alternate blockchain with no premine at all. They'd be creating a completely separate alternate currency, call it Ether-prime.

The things that makes one currency more attractive than another are other people to trade with, total volume of money you can move, prestige... and the share of the wealth that the prospective user can have. Code quality and features don't come into the question... especially if they're both using the same code.

The argument being made is that prospective users will see that they can get a bigger share of the wealth in Ether-prime than in Ether, because there's no premine in Ether-prime. At the beginning, neither Ether nor Ether-prime will necessarily have many users to trade with or much volume of money moved... so share of the wealth becomes a big motivator. The only things Ether will have over Ether-prime are prestige and good will, and those may not be enough to make people accept the premining.

If enough people choose Ether-prime over Ether in the beginning, Ether-prime becomes the *dominant* currency rather than an *alternate* currency. Which means that ""official"" Ether on the original block chain could have much, much less value than you anticipate.

Again, this could happen with NO modification to the code. There wouldn't really have to be a project. There would just have to be a nucleus of people who agree on a different set of parameters, early enough in the game that they can get enough mindshare to displace the ""official"" Ether.

Any proposed response to that should be aimed at making the Ether more attractive than Ether-prime for early adopters. So, for example, if you run a limited beta with selected ""loyal"" users, that means that as soon as you release the ""real"" system, new users will immediately have somebody to trade with in the Ether blockchain, whereas Ether-prime is left playing catchup. You use the exreme power of network effects to make your Ether more attractive than Ether-prime.

Now, even if you don't do that, you'll still have prestige on your side at launch... and that's a powerful force. On the other hand, it seems as though the only alternate currencies that succeed in growing with Bitcoin already established are currencies that people perceive as having fairer mining models. So you should know that you have a powerful counterfocrce against you.

And what you've written makes it sound like you don't even understand what you're being warned *might* happen.

&gt;

&gt;In [cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and [computer science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) a **hash tree** or **Merkle tree** is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the [hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) of the labels of its children nodes. Hash trees are useful because they allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of larger data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of [hash lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_list) and [hash chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain).

&gt;Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of the given hash tree requires processing an amount of data proportional to the [logarithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) of the number of nodes of the tree;  this contrasts with hash lists, where the amount is proportional to the number of nodes. The concept is named after [Ralph Merkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle).

"Unfortunately I'm not aware of any video's but here would be my own personal thoughts on your performance:

* You are comfortable in front of an audience (that is huge, not many people are).
* For the most part you covered the material by addressing the audience directly, and used the slides only as reference (this is good).
* When you didn't know the answer to something you admitted it with good humor.

---

Areas of improvement:

* You tried to cover too much material too quickly and too abstractly. Use concrete examples (Bob and Alice type examples for instance). Smart Contracts are a difficult concept to get across, but are the root of what makes Ethereum exciting. I'd drop the colored coins section entirely and focus on the contracts.

* Obviously the room conditions sucked. I think I overheard one of the audience members offer to drive the presentation software for you. I think holding the laptop in your hand was distracting both for you and the audience. If you have a podium, it isn't a big deal but in those conditions it is probably best to rope one of the audience members into driving the laptop.

Overall I think you gave a credible presentation, and what you need more than anything is simply a bit more practice with doing presentations in general. I'd highly recommend looking into joining something like Toastmasters.

Best of luck! :)

"Actually I do have a couple of solutions to your problems you have in the dapp section.

In order to create this contract you will either need to have one participant create it and then all other participants join it by sending an ""accept contract"" message. This is the easy way but requires participants checking the code each and every time.

option 2 you can create a ""deployment contract"" using the CREATE opcode (which currently is non-functional but i'm assured will work soon.) So one contract stores the raw bytecode in storage and then upon request can generate the requested contract. (If you wanted to get really fancy you could even over-write placeholders for particular values such as participants. as well as other pieces of the contract) this has the benefit that only this creation contract needs to be trusted. I have been working on this of other contracts where you need to be able to trust that a created contract is of the correct form.

The second thing which i might have a solution too is the tracking of them. This can be easily accomplished by a contract (either the one that created them or one that calls the creation contract.) I have used a linked list structure in DOUG-v3 to track automatically created poll contracts (from a trusted poll creation contract) which would be similar to what you might need.

https://github.com/dennismckinnon/Ethereum-Contracts/blob/master/DOUG/Doug-v3.lsp

If you look at the segment starting at line 93, this runs through the linked list looking for any resolved polls etc. This might be a useful structure for you depending on what precisely you want to do with the ""multi-sig"" contracts.

Oh you also mention using less storage by merging into a single storage location. This almost certainly would be cheaper since storage costs are so high. But of course it depends on how much accessing of the string you need to do since if you need to read every bit from 1:100 its going to cost 200 gas (rough calculation but there are at least 2 operations per bit. 3 if you count memory access) but a test for success is pretty simple you have an on-going counter so you don't have to perform the calculation each time. The one extra storage slot will be worth saving 90+. And of course you premise increasing the counter on the bit value associated with their position not being 1. You could also count rejections if you wanted to clean up whenever there was no way for it to pass. You have a three state thing here so the bit string should only indicate IF they have voted while the rejection and acceptance counters keep track of what they voted.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Asymptote***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote) :

&gt;

&gt;In analytic geometry, an **asymptote** (/ˈæsɪmptoʊt/) of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors. In some contexts, such as algebraic geometry, an asymptote is defined as a line which is tangent to a curve at infinity.

&gt;The word asymptote is derived from the Greek ἀσύμπτωτος (asumptotos) which means ""not falling together,"" from ἀ priv. + σύν ""together"" + πτωτ-ός ""fallen."" The term was introduced by Apollonius of Perga in his work on conic sections, but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.

&gt;There are potentially three kinds of asymptotes: horizontal, vertical and oblique asymptotes. For curves given by the graph of a function y = ƒ(x), horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function appro ...

"&gt; really fast

That's kind of a non-feature for Ethereum, as most scripts will be *very* simple.

&gt; easy to sandbox

I'm not terribly familiar with ""vanilla"" Lua nor LuaJIT, but have they been security audited for sandboxing? That's something *very* difficult to get right.

&gt; Is there a technical reason this can't happen or is it a preference? I struggle to see the point in reinventing the wheel, spending time implementing an interpreter, compiler, eventual machine code compiler, etc, when you have all of this already available and time could be devoted elsewhere.

The simplest reason I can think of is script compactness, Lua opcodes aren't necessarily designed for compactness (well of course they were to a degree, but that was only one of many considerations made when designing Lua's opcodes, actually don't Lua and LuaJIT use different opcodes?) Note that I'm not particularly convinced that the Ethereum team has done a great job of optimizing for space either, they're using a very straightforward bytecode.

Security in regards to bytecode is also important, a simple bytecode which only has a handful of instructions, with simple implementations is a lot easier to perform a security audit on than the (relatively) large Lua or LuaJIT implementations. Note that securing JITed code is even more difficult.

&gt; I know that vitalik made the argument that you don't want to be tied to a single language if we see some crazy changes in language design in the next 10-20 years, but can you future proof opcodes or an interpreter any more than you could a language?

"Very logical ideas. 

Several years ago, I wrote up how Apple and Google together could create an entertainment content creation and delivery platform, for creative people to create products (movies, music, books, etc), based on individuals cooperating on specific projects, basically using what is described as smart contracts, by transparently standardizing the entire legal, accounting, financing, distribution, etc. framework.

At that time the effort needed to deliver this, would have required the combined power of two industry giants - with ethereum the same might be implemented with much smaller intellectual, monetary investment, since ethereum seems to be just the platform, the language exactly for this.

I even pitched the executives of two Canadian entertainment companies to find a way together to pitch Google and Apple to create ""Gapple"".

They both declined as they saw the whole idea as a far out futuristic plan. 

I also realized, that a business model based on this platform would have destroyed a principal value of their companies, which was based on established, invaluable business connections - instead of the merit and quality of the created products.

Huge majority of companies today gain virtual monopolies by raising the barrier of entry as high as possible, in order to reduce competition. 

Many industry leader companies add very little, or no value in many products, other then their established industry infrastructure framework, which provides legal, financing, accounting, marketing of other people's ideas, intellectual properties.

If ethereum can commodify these processes, making them dirty cheap and available for projects in exchange of much smaller portion of equity than today, that could reward with more money the true creators, and devalue the currently highly overvalued finances-legal-accounting shell layer.

It could have the same effect as virtualization, cloud computing, that enables now start-ups to roll out operation without giving away exorbitant equity for initial financing and funding for tech infrastructure.

"Looking into it, they use the `.bit` domain, but a browser doesnt defaultly accept it. 

Basically `.bit` is a namespace in which the namespace bought/obtained with namecoin. Each competing 'name allocator' would have a namespace, or a program/sort of thing it lives in.

So basically different namecoins would probably be intended for different contexts. People might want to different domains namespaces for shops, personal websites, comments, names in games. Possibly games could use it as source of income.

The mechanism of getting and losing could also be different selling points. For instance namesquatters can be a problem, and the particular way it works has effect on incentive.

"Hi, this is something that matters to me.

But first, I'm not sure I understand your '50 dollars' comment. It's indeed very likely we'll see native mobile Ethereum clients right out of the gate, either built as reference clients, or based on community projects. These will be free, as I'd expect them to be. For reference, see this potential Objective-c Client project: http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/629/ethereum-objectivec. Android is a no-brainer.

Second, these clients will support any Ethereum Dapps. We're already factoring mobile phone displays for the distributed GUIs powering Ethereum, either as HTML and/or QT packages spread across bitttorrent nodes. On that topic, I encourage you to read this article by our CTO Gavin Wood at http://insightsintoamodernworld.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/apps-what-web-30-looks-like.html. It's very early days, but Gavin will be presenting mockups of this type of interface at our London event on May 9th. Don't think smart contracts, think 'decentralized web'.

Third, an anecdote: Emerging economies tend to skip technology generations. For example, in the Philippines few have landlines, but smart phones are everywhere. In Kenya, by 2009, mobile payments had already been adopted by 40 percent of the adult population, facilitating ~10 percent of the country's GDP. This may not mean much to you, but you should have seen the Billions invested by companies back then in Europe, attempting to push 'mobile payments' as a 'thing'. Project Oscar would like a word, please (http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/project-oscar-mobile-payments)

Finally, and this is my favorite topic, using reputation in place of collaterals. In Europe, when you need a loan, you use your house or car to 'back' the loan so to speak. What about countries where people do not necessarily have such assets? Are they out of luck? Well, in East Africa, Chamas (social groups - thank you John Samson Karanja for introducing me to them) could be a solution. Peers vouch for a group member, literally collateralizing debt with reputation. I'd love nothing more but to see this system operating globally, as opposed to the local communities where it currently strives. 

This is when one realizes that not only emerging economies could benefit from a project such as Ethereum (Somalia, with its absent rule of law, might be a prime candidate), but that actually, our own economies have a thing or two to learn on the topic. Microfinance, decentralized crowdfunding, and peer to peer insurance could indeed be the saving graces of many countries' economies.

"From what I've understood so far, Ethereum sounds like a really interesting and potentially transformative idea. The exciting and new thing is the ability to create programmable contracts. I am not interested in making money directly from the currency itself, but rather in the innovative possibilities opened up by the contracts. Unfortunately, the way the currency is being launched might create a barrier to innovation in that actually placing contracts onto the blockchain might turn out to be quite an expensive undertaking (because ether is needed for contract, processing fees etc). In my view for innovation to thrive, ether needs to be cheap and easy to get (by mining).

I think I agree with earlier contributors who have commented that the current plan is a dangerous mix of *great* new idea with a rather ambitious, speculative ""IPO"" style launch; the glitz and the ideas are in tension with one another. A bit reminiscent of dotcom bubble.

"I'm not convinced that stable value is an important or even good objective, at least in the early stages. It removes a major incentive for early adoption. That incentive might be important for overcoming the initial hurdle of being useless because nobody uses the currency yet. In Ethereum's case, I'm wondering what incentive remains for investors if the goal is to eliminate large capital gains.

The idea of changing issuance rates based on difficulty level is nonetheless interesting. My hunch is that there would be little effect on short-term fluctuations, which I think are most damaging to commerce. It would be interesting to check that with historical data on prices and difficulties.

Ultimately, some special provision for a stable value might be more important if the scalability problem is solved. As long as a single currency tops out at some level much lower than major-currency status, I think we're going to end up with values leveling off after the first several years anyway, simply because the currency physically can't keep growing.

"Afaics every script that is somehow a 'permanent fixture', with no connections to particular people, and that somehow never loses too much funds to get deleted is essentially equivalent to being a feature of ethereum. 

I cant answer your question, but the above implies ubfuscating privkeys into ethereum itself, not scripts would do the same.

Also, that is a *strong* statement. I.e. if you could for instance have 'magic infinite funds' for something like the [dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflsmuz), basically having that file could be used for mining!

Still, many scripts could be subsidizable with inflation, and not be fraudable.(i dont quite know)

Anyway, a little inflation may be a good thing, but it does beg the question who should get the coin. Regular mining is wasteful, so these are interesting, and that it can be done with script is aswel. Perhaps sub-currencies of ethereum could do it internally.

That said, i dont quite know how to give such a sub-currency value, ethereum itself could presumably only do it, but we currently only have relatively limited practical knowledge of scripts. Voting on scripts that would subsequently get some limited-to-the-desired-inflation 'magical funds' is an idea, but voting might presumably done by weight of coins, so there is a danger to overcentralization of coin through it..

"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it""  I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.  

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward.  Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

We don't need a Crypto-Microsoft. In fact, we don't need a crypto-Google. We need many competitors and honest competition...otherwise we probably wont like what happens 15-20 years down the road.

Just MHO, take it or leave it, but it is here with the sole intent of providing a non-biased look at things in this space.  I like MasterCoin (dont own them unfortunately), wish I trusted Hoskinson and the other team members who fail to acknowledge those from whom they wish to win the Championship Belt so I could feel good about Ether, and I own a small amount of PTS/AGS.  Longterm holder because I love the Devs, community and await the first Decentralized Bank in Keyhotee Free Space...

Cool stuff coming in the Bitcoin 2.0 space...hope more ethical versions come around.  I'm liking the prospects.

"Economist? Learn math if you dont already know it.(edit: oeh or compare existing business models with what ethereum may do in comparison) Mathematician or physicist? If you understand the concepts behind the system you can try think about what it takes for contracts to be economically viable,(that includes not-exploitable) or what it takes for trust/reputation networks, or how to make decisions. Things have already been written about it, of course!

It is also likely you will be able to understand serpent code in that case, though!(its nearly Python) The LLL code isnt really that much harder to understand though, it just has somewhat annoying aspects to it. Like a like lisp.. (function ..arguments), (+ ..arguments..) == (arg1 + arg2 ....) and `[location] value` sets values only held during execution and `[[location]] values` that are stored indefinately.(would be nice to just use names :), LLL just still needs that improvement)  `@value` accesses values held during execution and `@@value` contract storage. `{  }` help you make commands that run in sequence.

Writer/philosopher/socially knowledgable? Some of the things, like decision making may have social implications, i mean create discord or not..

"Lets put the fundraiser in simple terms that everyone can understand. Everyone should agree that all investments should have a proper risk/reward ratio. This project itself has a lot of risk and potentially a lot of reward, so neither can outweigh the other. Now lets look at this objectively from that perspective.

Ethereum project;

Risk = Very High

Reward = Very High

Founders;

Risk = 0%

Reward=100%

Early adopters;

Risk = 100%

Reward = ?

Put that on a graph. Does that seem like a fair transaction to you?

Just look at the risk/reward ratio and it is way out of line, bordering on insanity. Hubris and Greed comes to mind. If you were the world's greatest cook and asked a venture capitalist or businessman to fund your new restaurant, Guess who makes the most money? Whoever takes the most risk. That's the guy who is paying for the risk out of his own pocket. It's been that way since the beginning of time. Granted, if you have risked a lot of your time and mental energy, you deserve payment for assuming that risk of your time and potential energy as sweat equity.

This is the only project that I have ever heard of that the founders have no sweat equity, no equity in capital and want all the rewards before the business even opens and then will ask the investment community to fund the entire project before it even starts and assume all of the risk.

The current investment model is appalling and downright thievery of the bitcoin community. Vitalik, please quit trying to instill a sense of fear and demand by constantly bringing up ""whales"" as an excuse for this model. That's just lame and I can't believe people will fall for that (edit...yes I can believe some people will). We can all guess whose idea and where those tactics were borne from.

They need to offer more ETH per bitcoin, lower the MAX to an acceptable level and therefore the pre-mine. And lower their shares of the coin to a level that doesn't reflect a persona of greed. If they are right and follow through, they can still be multi-millionaires by changing the structure in a way that it is not overly diluted and fair and equitable to early investors. The way it is structured now, they are punishing you for being an early adopter and instantly becoming wealthy without any risk at all.

I feel that if you are going to ask the investment community to fund the entire project sight unseen, then there must be checks and balances of risk/reward for founders and early adopters. This project is NOT a slam dunk, there is immense risk to go along with the rewards they are alluding to. Therefore the founders must take some risk themselves and give opportunity for early adopters to gain reward.

"I agree 'cryptocontract' or 'self-enforcing contracts' would be better words. Cryptocontracts by themselves cant send anyone to jail, of course, and the worst that your wallet itself can do is reach zero. Lack of resources for your own sustainance or other people have to do it.

Also there are a lot of potential scripts that are good out there. Including giving more assurances. For instance you could have a script with your money, but you can only send from it at some set rate. It could have a list of N trusted people, M from which together to change the address. That is one mechanism to stop major accidental mistakes sending money. 

People of course have to be careful what contracts/scripts to use Afaik people can basically only end up with bad contracts if they're stupid(or stupid to act from badly informed information) or too limited in options. Both can happen in the real world already, and rarely does the 'flex' in non-factum contracts actually help anyone. Quite the opposite, from what i hear. Significant rights reductions for loans that happen to be owned by the state, in the Netherlands, they totally changed the rules for retirement funds, and 'mortage' means 'house with loan' here. You cant default and leave the house, you'd keep the remaining debt, on the plus side. (Goddammit my mother said with a regular mortage, if you leave the house at the last moment, everything paid on the house is gone, but that is actually a better situation.. I mean in the former it is all gone and you still have to pay some more..) And the bailouts are also examples where the rules bend, also to our detriment.

I reckon if the rules are bendable they'll usually bend towards those in power. There will be cases where this probably isnt enough. Crypto contracts need to pick their fights.

The fundraiser has been delayed over and over while the development continues, new people are being brought on board, research is being conducted. In funding ethereum at the fundraiser we will thus be voting on whether we like what they've been doing and trust them to continue that way.

So far, I like what the ethereum project is doing. I also trust that we will have plenty more information on their spending plans once the fundraiser is finally underway. And remember, if there is any group of people acutely sensitive to the problem of centralised control, it is these guys.

"The ethereum whitepaper explains the technical problem behind colored coins:

&gt;Bitcoin's Merkle tree construction allows for a protocol known as ""simplified payment verification"", where a client that does not download the full blockchain can quickly determine the validity of a transaction output by asking other nodes to provide a cryptographic proof of the validity of a single branch of the tree. The client will still need to download the block headers to be secure, but the amount of data bandwidth and verification time required drops by a factor of nearly a thousand. With colored coins, this is much harder. The reason is that one cannot determine the color of a transaction output simply by looking up the Merkle tree; rather, one needs to employ the backward scanning algorithm, fetching potentially thousands of transactions and requesting a Merkle tree validity proof of each one, before a client can be fully satisfied that a transaction has a certain color. After over a year of investigation, including help from ourselves, no solution has been found to this problem.

There is also the problem that with bitcoin colored coins would have to have some monetary value otherwise they would get treated as dust unless a 0.0001 bitcoin fee is paid. This means implementation is expensive. Without a strong use case nobody wants to have colored coins therefore there is little incentive to build the user clients and without the user clients there is no incentive for anyone to try to use it.

I don't know enough to comment on open transactions and mastercoin but I have a feeling they are coming up against even more technical challenges.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

"Vitaly's presentation showed how namecoin could be run on 5 lines of code. So I get the impression, that yes all the development done on namecoin could be ported to ethereum

So instead of trying to force, namecoin, colored coin, etc onto the bitcoin blockchain which it wasnt meant for, it can be written to run ontop of ethereum blockchain.

"You are correct in that this is not much of an issue for developers, but the problem falls on the shoulders of initial funders of the project.

*If* there is a copycat that catches on, the value of Ethereum probably immediately decreases. Given that this is not a completely unlikely scenario, and there isn't much to say it won't happen, why should funders risk putting money into a project which wouldn't return their investment? Would they not be better off waiting for launch and jumping in on exchange? 

If they do feel confident and fund the project but 2 years later it falls apart, the devs have already been paid in Bitcoin, other devs get the code, but what do initial funders get? They get left holding the bag.

&gt; And I can tell you that any developer with half a brain, which is still not enough to start understanding Ethereum's code and protocol, would largely prefer to join and help than try and be the latest copycat failure.

I'm not sure about that. There's a lot of idiots making altcoins right now, and you still have smart devs like Sunny King putting together things like Primecoin, Peercoin, Vertcoin, etc.

Bitcoin was able to avoid competitors being an issue because for the first 2-3 years there wasn't an immediate real competitor, and it was able to harness the network effect, to the point where even today where other alts have better features, it can maintain its status. Ethereum won't have this, there will likely be clones and alts before it even goes live.

"A coordination language is really about building large systems, like the Daemon in Daemon/Freedom. In such systems you might use Ethereum to deal with finances and resources for example, but have other components that deal with other stuff. The different components can be people, servers, algorithms, various software etc. so then a coordination language is used to make all these components composable, so they can all form one integrated system.

For example if one process is a person scanning a specific type of document, then a component could be made that looks for new documents in a folder and the person scanning the documents knows to save all scanned documents in that folder. That component now really encapsulates the scanning software and the person scanning the document, if you were to switch the scanner, the scanning software and the person with, say, a fully automatic scanner, the component would still look and behave in exactly the same way to all the other components in the system. The thing is really about wrapping all the jobs, software, web servers etc in this kind of components, then describe the flow of data, money, resources and things through a network of such components.

Since such components are not necessarily pure software, you can use types that refer to physical objects. For example a component for a 3d printer, can have one input and one output. The input has a CAD model as the type, while the output might have ""ABS plastic thing"" as the type. If the 3d printer was switched to another printer of even injection molding, as long as it takes the same input, the CAD model, and outputs an ABS plastic object, it wouldn't matter for the rest of the system. The output of the 3d printer component might be connected to a robot arm component, that would expect to find an ABS plastic thing at a specific position, but the robot arm does not care how that ABS plastic thing ended up in that specific position, just programming function doesn't care how an integer which is going to be its input, came to existence.

"&gt;there would be nothing stopping the miners themselves from creating blocks that are arbitrarily hard to compute.

Can you elaborate on their incentive to do this?

&gt; Bitcoin has the 1 MB limit; Ethereum needs to have either a mandatory fee or a few mandatory limits of its own.

It seems to me that if computational power is already a scarce resource, then why would further restrictions be needed? Shouldn't the market be able to price computing cycles on its own? 

Another thing I'm worried about is that two contracts could cost the exact same in terms of computation power but could represent completely different value to their respective users. This could show up in cases where one needs an important contract to be verified in as little a time as possible so that user may be willing to pay more for miners to prioritize it. Conversely, someone who can't afford to have their contract verified within minutes should be able to pay *something* and have it processed within a day or two. A fully market-driven fee structure should accommodate this.

This also affects people in developing countries who may not be able to afford the minimum transaction fee because it's too expensive relative to the value of the services backing it. It would make sense if they could pay a much lower fee and just expect it to take longer to process.

"Conference, Alpha Testnet and Fundraiser Updates

January 29, 2014 - By Team

Ethereum received an incredible response at the Miami Bitcoin Conference. We traveled there anticipating many technical questions as well as a philosophical discussion about the purpose of Ethereum; however, the overwhelming amount of interest and enthusiasm for the project was much larger than we had anticipated. Vitalik’s presentation was met with both a standing ovation and a question queue that took hours to address.

Because we intend on providing an equal opportunity to all those who want to be involved, and are reviewing the relevant logistical and regulatory issues for a fundraiser of this scale, we have decided to postpone the Feb 1 launch of the fundraiser. We will make the announcement of the new fundraiser launch date on our official website: Ethereum.org.

The Ethereum project is also excited to announce the alpha release of the open source testnet client to the community at the beginning of February. This will give people an opportunity to get involved with the project and experiment with Ethereum scripts and contracts, and gain a better understanding of the technical properties of the Ethereum platform. Launching the testnet at this date will give those interested in the fundraiser a chance to better understand what the Ethereum project is about before participating.

The testnet will include full support for sending and receiving transactions, the initial version of the scripting language as described in our whitepaper, and may or may not include mining. This will also be the first major cryptocurrency project to have two official clients released at the same time, with one written in C++ and the other in Go; a Python client is also in the works. A compiler from the Ethereum CLL to Ethereum script will be released very soon.

A note on security

The fundraiser will NOT be launching on February 1st and any attempt to collect funds at this time should be considered a scam.

"I'm not involved with Ethereum so I can't answer for what will be there from the start, apart from saying that things which can not be currently done, will not be in Ethereum from the start :p 

Now, there is several issues at hand here though. One is to keep keys and password secure attackers that might steal the resources they protect, another is ensure a computation has been executed correctly. 

My current understanding, hope vbuterin will correct me if I say something wrong here, is that Ethereum scripts will be executed by the miners, which ensure they will be executed correctly. Now once you have obfuscation, you could add obfuscated code to the blockchain, or maybe even external services like Maidsafe, which an Ethereum script might then tell someone to execute. So basically, once obfuscation technology matures,  if you want to upload a script to the blockchain, you run it through an obfuscator first, then upload the obfuscated script. The obfuscator just would be a local program that you would run on your computer, so Ethereum itself doesn't really need any special support for this. 

I have some related questions myself that perhaps someone knows the answer to?

What are the plans regarding IO operations in scripts? Allowing a script to make an arbitrary network connection opens many possibilities, but has a lot of security issues. As I understand in, the current version is Turing-complete, but when it comes to IO, its mainly just that a contract can store some data in the block chain.

"Every other investment out there requires an application and identification. Why not Ethereum? This can be fairly easy, straight-forward and fair. Just set a reasonable investment limit per ""person"" (natural or corporate), and require identification. How high or low you set the investment limit depends on how ""democratic"" you want to be.

"A coordination language is really about building large systems, like the Daemon in Daemon/Freedom. In such systems you might use Ethereum to deal with finances and resources for example, but have other components that deal with other stuff. The different components can be people, servers, algorithms, various software etc. so then a coordination language is used to make all these components composable, so they can all form one integrated system.

For example if one process is a person scanning a specific type of document, then a component could be made that looks for new documents in a folder and the person scanning the documents knows to save all scanned documents in that folder. That component now really encapsulates the scanning software and the person scanning the document, if you were to switch the scanner, the scanning software and the person with, say, a fully automatic scanner, the component would still look and behave in exactly the same way to all the other components in the system. The thing is really about wrapping all the jobs, software, web servers etc in this kind of components, then describe the flow of data, money, resources and things through a network of such components.

Since such components are not necessarily pure software, you can use types that refer to physical objects. For example a component for a 3d printer, can have one input and one output. The input has a CAD model as the type, while the output might have ""ABS plastic thing"" as the type. If the 3d printer was switched to another printer of even injection molding, as long as it takes the same input, the CAD model, and outputs an ABS plastic object, it wouldn't matter for the rest of the system. The output of the 3d printer component might be connected to a robot arm component, that would expect to find an ABS plastic thing at a specific position, but the robot arm does not care how that ABS plastic thing ended up in that specific position, just programming function doesn't care how an integer which is going to be its input, came to existence.

I feel that Ethereum is not only about bitcoin 2.0, it s a new paradigm for the whole crypto world, whether it is bitcoin or altcoin.
Therefore, I feel that ethereum should give also the possibility for altcoins holders to invest as equitably as possible compared to bitcoins holders. Ideally being able to invest other cryptos than bitcoin would be awesome but i understand that it is not possible. So those altcoins holders (like myself) would sell some of their alt holdings for some bitcoins. But it would be only a few bitcoins.
It seems like a lot of ideas that have been used to create ethereum come from altcoins such as LiteCoin (hard-memory scrypt), PrimeCoin (1mn block), Peercoin (PoS) so it would be logical that Ethereum gives back a little to the alt-community by letting altcoin holders invest in an equitable way.

"Yes, so what if there are so many scripts on the block-chain that your average miner can't run all the scripts of the block before a new block is found?

As far as verification is concerned, the cost of running scripts is not less than verifying if the hash found by another passes the difficulty test. In the Ethereum whitepaper it says there's a block time of 60 seconds. As I understand it this means a miner needs to be able to execute all scripts within 60 seconds to be able to validate a block. 

The fees become cheaper as the total processing power of the network grows, but this says nothing about the processing power of individual nodes. Cheaper fees means more and longer scripts on the block-chain. There can come a point where so much code needs to be executed to be able to verify a block that slower miners can't keep up. If the load of scripts keep growing more and more miners can't verify blocks anymore, it leaves only the most powerful mining nodes in the game.

"The premise that there will be a significant and dominating economic construct called ""wages"" or like wages in the cryptocurrency-based economy is not a given.  This new economy will likely be very fluid in its organization and in the opportunities it presents.  Groups will spontaneously organize around an idea, execute it and possibly move on when something better comes along.  There will be some stability and some inertia for important and well-executed services.  But the barrier to entry to create a start-up and offer an innovative service will be very low.  And attracting funding for a good idea will be fast and easy compared to today's funding models.  Employment will likely often take the form of partial ownership and dividends and partial compensation in other forms (maybe salary, maybe profit sharing, maybe bounties for projects executed).  Distributed Autonomous Organizations with broad ownership will likely come to dominate when the ecosystem has gained a degree of maturity.

Here is a somewhat relevant paragraph from something I am working on at the moment:

""Ethereum (or something like it) is necessary and inevitable.  It will enable distributed replacements for centralized services.  Hierarchically organized central control of systems and organizations was an optimal paradigm when communication and information sharing was difficult, slow and expensive.  In the context of current information processing and communications systems, rapid, widely distributed consensus becomes a viable organizing principle.  And given the ease and propensity for corruption, damage, subversion or co-opting of centralized control structures by corporate leaders, governments, shadow-government agencies, and criminal organizations, a mechanism for distributed control and governance of organizations will surely be well received.""

So while hierarchy and wage slavery made sense in the old slow, stagnant paradigm, the new fluid, dynamic paradigm will likely see regular and rapid reconfiguration of business and other organizations and compensation structures will reflect that agility. 

That's the big picture, long-term ""profound"" answer -- or at least one possible answer.

There are so many other answers.  Basically the economy will configure itself so that it works, if there are enough participants who find the economy a valuable place to spend their time, effort and money.  

Ethereum will enable the easy of creation of cryptocurrencies and distributed exchanges will facilitate rapid conversions into whatever currency is most appropriate for a given use.  A cryptocurrency that tracks Swiss Francs can be used to pay a wage-earner based in Geneva, while her colleague in Peru can be paid in a cryptocurrency that tracks the Nuevo Sol.  For as long as these are the currencies in which the bulk of living expenses are paid, compensation can be negotiated in them.

To reiterate: currently, there are no apps that use the identity info in a way that needs to be verifiably enforced.

The gist of what I'm saying is that whenever you need to transfer data between (into) chains, you end up needing to bundle both chain softwares together, else use a trusted source of that chain (you have to trust that data). Having verifiable rules based off that info is not feasible.

The beauty of ethereum is that you can *reuse* applications and *securely link* relationships between them. Once you get data into the ether, you have the assurance not only *that* contract can act on the data, but, if stored, other contracts can, as well. There is no disjoint part.

"Morozov, lol. I've been told I should read *To Save Everything* but balked when I read [this review](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9914954/To-Save-Everything-Click-Here-by-Evgeny-Morozov-review.html) - choice snip:

&gt;The problem is it’s all dressed up in a hyperactive, shouting tone, like a man in a loud jacket trying to sell you insurance while telling you that all the competitors are crooks.

Your question though is v. difficult to answer, and TBH, I'm reduced to hunches when trying. But fuck it, this is reddit... Partly because I'm a modernist of a sort. I think cryptocurrencies are a reactionary element of a wider more interesting project worth putting a political wager on (a definition of what this wider project this is exactly defies my articulation—cryptopolitics? Open-source organisation?). Perhaps cryptocurrencies, in liquifying the rancid foundations of state-bank apparatuses, are a necessary stage towards something more radical. I won't lie, I'd like to see everything dialectically flipped: crypto-*un*-currencies, automation of market-bypassed production, relentless social use-need matching... Ethereum, to my knowledge, seems to be the only project that verges toward this side of the wider project, in demonstrating that it takes the trouble of devising a Turing-complete language, emphasising the architecture (potentiality) over unimaginative applications (actuality) of the blockchain, and attempting to define smart-contracts/DAOs—however problematical. It's a material fact that ever more sophisticated forms of automation or smart-contracts now exist, and all we can say for certain is that it's “for better or worse”, yet by the same token, present itself as an opportunity, in *resembling* a project with traction on social formations to come. This is already significant even without having achieved anything, because its practice is to build consequentially. The present is saturated with exhausted, inconsequential organisation; some remain popular simply because they feel-good in their overt impotence and symbolism (#Occupy, Indignados, Democracia real ya, Pussy Riot, Voina...); others because they're integral to hegemony and facilitate corruption (trade unions, parliamentarians, ""radical"" opposition parties...).

"&gt; If some of Maidsafe's technologies rise up to the challenge of crossing this bar then we'll be very happy to use them as our backbone.

We will be glad to see you there as well Vitalik. I believe Ethereum is another great project looking to achieve things never previously imagined.  Its tough, easy, happy and sad all at the same time working at this pace and attempting to read everyone about every project. I will try and summarise some key points regarding MaidSafe and hope it helps. 

We have written many papers and attended many events in this journey. We still find it hard to explain (well I do). I think this is not unusual for a big change. Bitcoin is also hard to explain to some folks. 

We will be launched soon and then will get a chance to measure, tune and check all algorithms. We have had a ton of review though over the years (I started all this in 1996 with a decentralised approach to linux servers that I had designed). In recent years since MaidSafe started (2006) I spent 8 months in a non English place to get peace to do the initial design. I then spent nearly a year travelling around Universities explaining and getting peer review. It's not the be all and end all, but we seek critique everywhere so happy to see it actually. We did work early on and spoke with many people in the field such as Vint Cerf and Deborah Gordon (of the Gordon institute in Stanford), presented at a google conference on scalability and a keynote at the british computer society xmas lecture etc. Also spent a lot of time on kademlia implementation and attacks/designs with Mario Kolberg (one of the the authors in the p2p handbook). A couple of us have spent many years on the cryptopp library (Wei's library) and that's a great place for some pretty deep cryptography questions and ideas. So we search everywhere for valid critique. It is a huge system to describe quickly and that seems to be the main reason for misunderstanding in many cases. None of this is proof of the whole network, but there is a lot of research and testing taken place, including three pre &amp; post doctorate research projects we sponsored for simulation and modelling.  Like everyone we try very hard to make sure we get the system tested as we go along. 

We hope to have some papers soon that further explain some the parts you are discussing or querying here. It may not be obvious or well explained how chained consensus groups work and how they prevent birthday paradox and related sybil type attacks. There was a paper on attack vectors from the data part of the network supposed to be available to the mailing list weeks ago, but it is still waiting on registration for the WWRF forum. We should have posted this paper on  arxiv. 

We will probably try and get the routing paper that explains some of the DHT theory underlying this posted in the next week or so. It will help a lot.  Routing relies on a reliable UDP that has pseudo tcp type connection oriented attributes. This has been worked on by Chris Kohlhoff (of c++ ASIO), Anthony Williams (c++ concurrency) and now another great boost developer Nail Douglas. These parts are critical for full decentralisation of all data in my opinion.

Where single entities (i.e. crypto currencies, structured data version handlers) are involved there are also asymm signatures involved as the chain mechanism cannot work for non group id's.  Currently this is RSA 4096 signatures. So there is a  lot we do not explain in detail, but there is a lot to it all (each client on the network has many crypto key pairs for different aspects, as well as revocation pairs).

I hope this helps folks a little, I think the papers will define more clearly and also show some mathematical modelling of some of these points. ",0,t1_cgblrny,t3_217fsm,t1_cgambcf,False,,7,False,,1433063078,1395768938,dirvine,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cgblrny,True,0

"Sounds important. But doesnt neccesarily affect ethereum?

I am sure some dusty-minded engineers are thinking they're doing it for efficiency. Cant help but wonder if they looked at youtube videos crossing, that is going to be a lot of data..

Whats the status of FOSS/software activist groups trying to affect/do HTTP development? Could there be any way to both be able to cache and have it anonymous?(seems unlikely, but.. crypto is very wtf)

So basically https the private key is at the server, but they mitm it because the certificate authority can say 'this pubkey is good too', and then a intermediate server uses https, and then retransmits with a different privkey. One way around this could be to just start a separate certificate authority? Edit: that wouldnt help, the browser would just tell you it doesnt trust the pubkey, not give you a way around.. You could add another layer of encryption, so then they would have to add another layer of mitm, haha.

Btw should use [Tor](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/), btw. That said, even when using tor-to-clearnet, this would decrease privacy a tiny bit, as the exit node and snoopers beyond it can see more.(darknet is unaffected by this) Of course, it is *much* less efficient for internet traffic. Note: wikipedia mentions https being developped for tor nodes.. I think they mean the *exit* nodes can enter malicious stuff, the intermediate ones can only tell where it came from and where to send it.(But not where the subsequent node will send it)

People already thought of fake searches to decrease tracking.(when i saw it, it was poorly implemented) Fake browsing is also possible. Main problem is how to do all the thing the browser does without showing the user anything, and how to figure out the 'real' links.

If they try to block people will try encode it into data looks otherwise, once they try block that, wasting a lot of cpu, they will hurt businesses that are accidentally also blocked, and people trying to not be tracked(stalked) all the time go stenography.

"I'm not convinced that stable value is an important or even good objective, at least in the early stages. It removes a major incentive for early adoption. That incentive might be important for overcoming the initial hurdle of being useless because nobody uses the currency yet. In Ethereum's case, I'm wondering what incentive remains for investors if the goal is to eliminate large capital gains.

The idea of changing issuance rates based on difficulty level is nonetheless interesting. My hunch is that there would be little effect on short-term fluctuations, which I think are most damaging to commerce. It would be interesting to check that with historical data on prices and difficulties.

Ultimately, some special provision for a stable value might be more important if the scalability problem is solved. As long as a single currency tops out at some level much lower than major-currency status, I think we're going to end up with values leveling off after the first several years anyway, simply because the currency physically can't keep growing.

"I agree with pretty much everything you said. You'll want a light interface to do name-&gt;identity info lookup, you can use .onion addresses as identity data, merge mine? sure.

The convoluted part is *not* the fact that we're using a blockchain-based tech to store identities. It all sounds well and good. In fact, for what's available now, OneName is perfect.

It gets convoluted when you want your services to interact with the identity info or enforce rules around that identity. You then have to query the name-chain for the info you need, and insert that data into a transaction on another chain. Enforcing service rules based on identity info means you practically need that info stored in whichever chain you are using. Thats why you have Twister using its own name system, instead of just using OneName/Namecoin.

This isn't necessarily an issue at the moment, since there isn't even much of a coherent ecosystem of decentralized services yet. However, once more services are layered on ethereum, I think it will start to make more sense to transfer identities over there.

Then again, perhaps most of this is sorted out when you add an ethereum address alongside the other information in your OneName. OneName can act as a sort of meta-identity system.

&gt;  Why don't you release the software for free, no pre-mine, and then settle to build a services company on top of the network?

That was indeed an idea that we had earlier on. However, what we realized is that if we try to extract a profit from services on top of Ethereum then things will actually be much worse for the community. We would need to hobble our services with fees, just like every other company that sells services inevitably has to (eg. Bitcoin exchanges' trading fees) in order to generate revenue. We do not want to do this. We want to release awesome platforms and awesome tools, and make them available to everyone at a 0% fee aside from Etherium network fees.

"&gt; Dr Gavin Wood spent the majority of his talk on Friday arguing against centralisation. He argued for a need for ethereum as a trust-less system.
&gt; What concerns me is that giving an estimated $20 million dollars to the ethereum foundation to help ""fund development"" will actually just centralize development around the ideas the ethereum foundation wants exploring, not what the community wants, another problem with this approach is that we have to put an extremely large amount of trust in the ethereum foundation not to simply run away with everybody's bitcoins.

The Ethereum team wants nothing more than to find a trajectory that aligns both the community-at-large and the core team members with the same economic incentive. If anyone has math/econ models to achieve this, please share them on [our official forums](https://forum.ethereum.org/) so we can arrive at a solution that is win-win for everyone involved :)

&gt; I have not seen any guarantees about how much of the money raised in the IPO will go to fund bounties and what amount will go straight into the founder's pockets.

I'm under the impression that documents related to this will be released before the ether pre-sale. Again, the question is how to align all the incentives just in the right way to ensure different types of projects run in different types of ways. i.e. An academic research group will operate under different constraints than a for-profit venture.

&gt; Most pre mined currencies have been called out as scamcoins in the past, the only difference between them and ethereum is that there is innovation on top of ethereum and it has been claimed the pre mine is for the good of the currency. I have yet to see a successful premine coin.
&gt;This premium is not at all necessary and is harmful. It will reduce the chance of mainstream adoption of ethereum. Throughout the currencies future, there will be criticism that it is just a pyramid scheme, more so than for bitcoin, especially due to the ""early adopter discount"".

First and foremost, Ethereum is producing actual technology. You can download proof-of-concept builds that interoperate on a testnet from https://code.ethereum.org, which is regularly updated with builds in both C++ and Go for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can mine (on testnet), send gas/ether to other accounts, even create contracts and execute them.

&gt; Ethereum represents a potentially great idea. I urge the ethereum foundation to reconsider the premine. You are risking the currencies future for short term financial rewards. Please consider adopting the distribution model of æthereum. You could develop your proof of stake algorithm, slasher, to create a currency which does not have the waste of mining. It is my belief that without your support, æthereum will be forgotten, and without your acceptance of æthereum's ideas, ethereum will fail like every other premium currency. Please make this the future, instead of another get rich quick scheme.

If you were to take a straw poll of the main team (including all support roles, not just devs), I think you'd find that the vast majority are **BY FAR** more concerned about the health of the Ethereum ~~community~~ ecosystem than any amount of cash. The unfortunately reality is that many of us have been working on Ethereum for nearly 6 months without so much as a single satoshi in payment. Some of us have families &amp; mortgages and have had to take loans to pay the bills while we clarify all the complications of launching world-impacting technology with geographically-distributed team members on a shoestring budget.

I hope the community can evaluate us on our actions. Scammers would have ""launched"" &amp; disappeared long ago. Instead, we're building alliances with partners all throughout the world, including 40+ self-organized meetups and dozens of developers contributing to MIT-licensed projects. We're doing our best to make it to conferences to speak, explain, and mix ideas with others all while sleeping on the floor, working 18 hour days, and spending our own savings to make sure the technology marches forward, payday be damned. ;)

"As Vitalik indicated, we have no idea where the 29.4% number came from.  Any speculations at this point are unfounded.  We are still working out budgets and other financial issues and have not finalized any numbers. 

We are acutely aware of the community sentiment regarding a possible pre-mine.  We are also weighing the value of having ETH to pay salaries which keeps our individual and corporate interests more completely aligned with those of Genesis Sale ETH buyers.  Whether there is a pre-mine or not, we will need to have lots of ETH on day one to pay out obligations (e.g. salaries to developers), to help fund third parties who are developing DApps on Ethereum, and possibly to help stabilize the currency in the early days.  We are looking at ways to reduce the pre-mine significantly and possibly even eliminate it.  If we do end up eliminating it or having a very small pre-mine, we will have to buy ETH in the market which creates other issues.

We certainly don't want the role of a central bank, but in the early days of bootstrapping the system, it may be prudent to ensure that the currency is stable while new businesses on the system are making their services available and figuring out the implementational details of their business models.  Some third parties have already indicated that they are interested in setting up trade desks to stabilize any currency fluctuations (and be paid for taking risks in these activities).  Such groups will likely assist ETH to remain in a non-volatile trading band and they will likely have other businesses that depend on an ETH price that is not excessively volatile.  In the event that there is not enough ETH liquidity at certain times and exchange rates rise rapidly, we may want to have a pool of readily available ETH that we can draw from to reduce drastic upward volatility and enable businesses on the system to operate economically while the economy grows and gains stability. Bootstrapping an economy will be an interesting endeavor.  We expect businesses on the system to figure things out, bottom up, grass roots.  But one thing they don't need to contend with is an excessively volatile ETH price, so we may step in on occasion to dampen large swings.  This is all still under discussion and rest assured that we will default to fully free market dynamics as soon as possible.

"I agree that the readability will probably become a key feature. Every single line of my code is commented because if it wasn't I would never have been able to remember what i was doing halfway through!

That said. The assumption that a more efficient contract will be a more honest one is not completely valid. I discovered while doing this that the best way to increase efficiency in these contracts is to order the logical statements in order of nested constraints (so you don't need to check something multiple times) and then in terms of most likely to occur. 

Admittedly these are just minor improvements for this contract because I'm still learning but one example is that a tie game is far more likely then a winner in tictactoe. so at one point I checked if it was a tie game first in order to avoid having to check if player 1 won or player 2 won since those are far less likely.

Relating this back to the discussion. All ""Admin"" powers are located at the end of the contract because they will almost never be used . as such they also won't affect the efficiency of the rest of the program but i could have easily written an admin power that lets me change the game board of a particular game.

Of course there should be ways to detect this... maybe? The problem as I see it. Ethereum has validated what was supposed to happen. as far as the network is concerned this is how things should be. so without reading the code and checking for a backdoor... i'm not sure how you could do it. This program is only 250 lines long But you could easily envision a much longer contract that has a tiny clause around line 892 which allows you to do all kinds of bad things.

for example:

(when (= (txsender) &lt;Your address here&gt;) (suicide (txsender))

That one line would make it possible for you to define a special account which would steal all funds in the contract and destroy the contract.
That could be pretty hard to catch even in the most readable programs...

(Note my tictactoe game has suicide capabilities given to the admin simply because when i was testing this i didn't want to leave a bunch of contracts around with usable funds in them!  Also this isn't a financial contract its just a game. I don't think such a feature would fly in a financial contract. That might be one quick check.

Maybe Ethereum come out and is so popular that it ends up increasing in value much more than Bitcoin, at that point, even if Bitcoin has limited supply, people might not want to store value in it long term. That scenario is pretty unlikely, but Bitcoin's ascent from 2009 to now was, too.

Something more interesting is if you are just using Bitcoin as a store of wealth, there are other coins like Peercoin explicitly designed to do that and will do it better. Actually PPC was designed to be the same store of wealth to Bitcoin in the way you are juxtaposing BTC to Ethereum.

"Ether is not stock. Stock is issued by a corporation centrally. In contrast, mining is decentralized and issued slowly, where the price is set by supply from the miners and demand from consumers. If Ethereum really wants to treat ether like stock then there should be no mining what-so-ever: they would be the sole issuers and the public would trade on it on the secondary market; if they needed to raise more funds, they would issue more just like any normal company. However you can't have both a mining model and a stock-market model simultaneously and expect any serious investment in the project. Here's why:

If the price of the IPO isn't *below* the market rate once miners start selling, then everyone who invested early will take a huge loss. This means any rational investor would stay the hell away from the IPO and just wait till ether comes on the market. If not, they are trusting that the devs can accurately predict the price of ether *before* mining begins - while you're at it, you might as well ask them what they think the price of bitcoin will be and trade accordingly.",0,t1_cfc10ll,t3_1xg24f,t1_cfbat9p,1392071198,,2,False,,1432340159,1392070144,asherp,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cfc10ll,True,0
"The base claim here is quite interesting: that tx fees - even in Bitcoin - aren't just a simple trade between the tx sender and a miner, where the sender pays BTC to a miner and the miner processes the (perhaps extra large) transaction. But rather that the rest of the network ""must"" also bear the costs. 

Thus if blocksize were uncapped, the argument goes, miners would process big transactions that are profitable for them (because they receive the entire fee, which exceeds their own costs) but a net loss for the network as a whole (because the cost to the network exceeds the fee). Thus ""tx fees are not a market"" because there's a ""tragedy of the commons.""

One reservation I have is that it's not actually the case that other nodes must bear the cost. They have a choice whether to relay larger transactions and they can set their own blocksize limits. If it becomes unprofitable for the rest of the network to deal in larger blocks, the miners that do will find themselves isolated, will they not? 

More generally, for their to be a tragedy of the commons there needs to be a commons - that is, a rivalrous resource that everyone can consume and that no one can restrict the consumption of. 

For example an unowned lake around which is a ring of houses. If everyone can freely fish the lake, overfishing will destroy it. But the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum seems different: the network node resources seem less like the lake and more like the resources within the houses themselves, where if you allow your house space and tools to be used by others you get to use everyone else's (you get to participate in the HouseShare system). Critically, this does *not* make the housing spaces and tools a commons, because if one is too greedy in their use of other people's things they may simply find themselves cut off from the system by other homeowners.

"&gt; Dr Gavin Wood spent the majority of his talk on Friday arguing against centralisation. He argued for a need for ethereum as a trust-less system.
&gt; What concerns me is that giving an estimated $20 million dollars to the ethereum foundation to help ""fund development"" will actually just centralize development around the ideas the ethereum foundation wants exploring, not what the community wants, another problem with this approach is that we have to put an extremely large amount of trust in the ethereum foundation not to simply run away with everybody's bitcoins.

The Ethereum team wants nothing more than to find a trajectory that aligns both the community-at-large and the core team members with the same economic incentive. If anyone has math/econ models to achieve this, please share them on [our official forums](https://forum.ethereum.org/) so we can arrive at a solution that is win-win for everyone involved :)

&gt; I have not seen any guarantees about how much of the money raised in the IPO will go to fund bounties and what amount will go straight into the founder's pockets.

I'm under the impression that documents related to this will be released before the ether pre-sale. Again, the question is how to align all the incentives just in the right way to ensure different types of projects run in different types of ways. i.e. An academic research group will operate under different constraints than a for-profit venture.

&gt; Most pre mined currencies have been called out as scamcoins in the past, the only difference between them and ethereum is that there is innovation on top of ethereum and it has been claimed the pre mine is for the good of the currency. I have yet to see a successful premine coin.
&gt;This premium is not at all necessary and is harmful. It will reduce the chance of mainstream adoption of ethereum. Throughout the currencies future, there will be criticism that it is just a pyramid scheme, more so than for bitcoin, especially due to the ""early adopter discount"".

First and foremost, Ethereum is producing actual technology. You can download proof-of-concept builds that interoperate on a testnet from https://code.ethereum.org, which is regularly updated with builds in both C++ and Go for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can mine (on testnet), send gas/ether to other accounts, even create contracts and execute them.

"Afaik ethereum uses a key-value system. if you use `contract.storage[H(name_string)+k]=..stuff..`, the values of `k` you never set dont require storage. Would seem to me that allowing too high values of `k` essentially decrease the difficulty for attackers, only needing partial collisions. (I think the allowed range of `k` has to be really large for it to really be a problem though..)

Still i prefer the idea of a separate id-contract . However, the second contract doesnt seem neccessary because k∈{0,1} should be fine.

     contract.storage[ethereum_address] =name_string           #Optional

On the id-contract:

     contract.storage[H(""reddit/username"")] = ""meeee""

That said, you could do it differently again, the namecoin just pointing to contracts from names and the contracts storing human-readable-names, ethereum addresses.

"I'm not convinced that stable value is an important or even good objective, at least in the early stages. It removes a major incentive for early adoption. That incentive might be important for overcoming the initial hurdle of being useless because nobody uses the currency yet. In Ethereum's case, I'm wondering what incentive remains for investors if the goal is to eliminate large capital gains.

The idea of changing issuance rates based on difficulty level is nonetheless interesting. My hunch is that there would be little effect on short-term fluctuations, which I think are most damaging to commerce. It would be interesting to check that with historical data on prices and difficulties.

Ultimately, some special provision for a stable value might be more important if the scalability problem is solved. As long as a single currency tops out at some level much lower than major-currency status, I think we're going to end up with values leveling off after the first several years anyway, simply because the currency physically can't keep growing.

The fundraiser has been delayed over and over while the development continues, new people are being brought on board, research is being conducted. In funding ethereum at the fundraiser we will thus be voting on whether we like what they've been doing and trust them to continue that way.

So far, I like what the ethereum project is doing. I also trust that we will have plenty more information on their spending plans once the fundraiser is finally underway. And remember, if there is any group of people acutely sensitive to the problem of centralised control, it is these guys.


and finally, I think trying to perpetuate the extreme inequality of btc distribution as you suggest as an alternative (æthereum) is a bad idea. That just sounds like large btc holders wanting to have their cake and eat it too.

"Afaics every script that is somehow a 'permanent fixture', with no connections to particular people, and that somehow never loses too much funds to get deleted is essentially equivalent to being a feature of ethereum. 

I cant answer your question, but the above implies ubfuscating privkeys into ethereum itself, not scripts would do the same.

Also, that is a *strong* statement. I.e. if you could for instance have 'magic infinite funds' for something like the [dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflsmuz), basically having that file could be used for mining! 

Note afaict the dropbox scheme does not actually pay for serving the data to people.. Got [a concept](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1yvr3a/bitcoins_price_fall_will_affect_ethereums_launch/cfoa3j4) for that too, but with inflation subsidy servers would create fake viewers. Basically it cant be taken for granted that mechanisms cant be played.

Still, many scripts could be subsidizable with inflation, and not be fraudable.(i dont quite know)

Anyway, a little inflation may be a good thing, but it does beg the question who should get the coin. Regular mining is wasteful, so these are interesting, and that it can be done with script is aswel. Perhaps sub-currencies of ethereum could do it internally.

That said, i dont quite know how to give such a sub-currency value, ethereum itself could presumably only do it, but we currently only have relatively limited practical knowledge of scripts. Voting on scripts that would subsequently get some limited-to-the-desired-inflation 'magical funds' is an idea, but voting might presumably done by weight of coins, so there is a danger to overcentralization of coin through it..

"See, that's the problem; I don't think that way. If there's one question that keeps me awake at night, it's the thought that perhaps everything I've sank my life into for the past 3 years is a technological and ideological dead end, and perhaps traditional centralized institution-based mechanisms based around corporations and banks and governments and incremental innovation respecting the existing establishment are actually the best way for society to move forward in solving the issues that really matter for the majority of people.

For what it's worth, I am very confident that the crypto behind Ethereum is fine from a technical standpoint, and that we have the skills to do it.

"Ethereum _is_ building a ""sidechain"" to Bitcoin.  

We have always anticipated that Bitcoin will remain a slowly evolving, rock-solid, network for transmission and storage of value and that Ethereum will operate alongside.  Various mechanisms will enable decentralized exchange of BTC and ETH and various other cryptocurrencies either developed on the Ethereum network or external to it.  But of course we can't wait for the Bitcoin protocol to enable exchange mechanisms.  This could take years to be designed, vetted and incorporated into Bitcoin, if ever.  

Perhaps it would be better to implement sidechains in a fashion that does not affect or require change to the Bitcoin protocol which would require a hard fork.

"Why do we need to have enforced rules? What sort of rules?

Afaik Twister basically gives every person a little bit of data that people can access. It has a namecoin-like system to associate things with pretty names.(unlike TOR, see no reason the DHT would have any name other than the 'simple' one, just the one on the blockchain under a name can write to a particular name)

From the [whitepaper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152), its three 'mostly disjoint parts'; blockchain, Distributed Hash Table(DHT), bittorrent-like thingy. That seems to corroborate that there are no complicated rules to enforce, and i read the blockchain part and it only contains user registrations. Found the paper hard to absorb, so may have missed a bit, but from what i read i am pretty sure there is no tough identity data in the blockchain, or rules to deal with. They probably could simply join namecoin, or ethereum, or even both, by just having a little namespace for both.

Btw about twister, hmm probably you can DHT a string, so doing that to URLs.. So presumably it can do a 'comment anywhere'.. A 'documentation everywhere', with some kind of wiki mechanism would be neat too.

Even with a blockchain, why would clients bother to put any information about namecoin in, they can just use the address namecoin tells them is associated on client side, and the blockchain of whatever system they use only needs to know that address. When they want to go back they can just query back client-side too.

The only place where that seems to be an issue is when the namecoin indicates a change of data, like a pubkey for that system. However, the older key would still be in the namecoin system, so finding back the name should be possible..

Hell, in principle ECDSA pubkeys can be the same accross, though people have worry about the security of often-used ECDSA public keys to the point of suggesting not reusing them. Whenever you receive new coin, you can easily change addresses.

"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it""  I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.  

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward.  Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

We don't need a Crypto-Microsoft. In fact, we don't need a crypto-Google. We need many competitors and honest competition...otherwise we probably wont like what happens 15-20 years down the road.

Just MHO, take it or leave it, but it is here with the sole intent of providing a non-biased look at things in this space.  I like MasterCoin (dont own them unfortunately), wish I trusted Hoskinson and the other team members who fail to acknowledge those from whom they wish to win the Championship Belt so I could feel good about Ether, and I own a small amount of PTS/AGS.  Longterm holder because I love the Devs, community and await the first Decentralized Bank in Keyhotee Free Space...

We agree with you regarding the importance of getting it right.  Conducting a sale of ether is a huge responsibility that involves legal, tax, communications and security considerations.  A large amount has been done in each of those dimensions and we are also, of course, furthering software development and various other projects all the time.

I can share that we are significantly advanced in the development of the ether sale web site mechanisms and in the hot/cold storage system.  In accord with the Ethereum philosophy, we will be open sourcing the general design of the hot/cold storage system so that others may apply it to their own unique situations.   Once we deem the system ready to go, we will have well respected industry experts audit the system.

We are still in the process of having legalities and other issues vetted by various experts.  This is a global project, so we need to pay attention to such details as they apply to various different locales.

While I can't give a concrete date for the ether sale at this point, I can state that it will not occur before the end of the Bitcoin Expo in Toronto (Apr 11-13) since Ethereum will have a sizable presence there and we will need to focus on that event.

"Your comparison with Satoshi really isn't fair. Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem and brought a completely novel concept to widespread adoption, single-handedly. And even after all that, Satoshi doesn't seem to have spent any coin on himself, after all these years! If Satoshi ever spends his coin, I am sure he will spend the bulk of it for the good of humanity, rather than buying for himself mega-islands/yachts/planes/etc.

If Satoshi had baked into the protocol that even before mining, after 5 years he would get 43% of the bitcoins, you can bet bitcoin adoption wouldn't have been near as big as it was. And I'm sure someone would have forked it to make a fairer bitcoin, which would have grown more popular.

Now compare that with Ethereum. The team has 47 (!) people, is not nearly as big an incremental advance, and has competition already in the form of ColoredCoins, Counterparty, MasterCoin, etc. Granted the scripting idea seems the most advanced I have seen, but that doesn't mean it can't be implemented by others.

I feel that Ethereum is not only about bitcoin 2.0, it s a new paradigm for the whole crypto world, whether it is bitcoin or altcoin.
Therefore, I feel that ethereum should give also the possibility for altcoins holders to invest as equitably as possible compared to bitcoins holders. Ideally being able to invest other cryptos than bitcoin would be awesome but i understand that it is not possible. So those altcoins holders (like myself) would sell some of their alt holdings for some bitcoins. But it would be only a few bitcoins.
It seems like a lot of ideas that have been used to create ethereum come from altcoins such as LiteCoin (hard-memory scrypt), PrimeCoin (1mn block), Peercoin (PoS) so it would be logical that Ethereum gives back a little to the alt-community by letting altcoin holders invest in an equitable way.

However, you can't really use the measured data in ethereum. I cannot exclude the possibility that there is no way to have a contract use the data.. But i have my doubts.

To be honest, i think there is a better chance trying to create a human identity by having a network of humans with some incentive to add 'true nonduplicates' and an disincentive against duplicates, or an incentive to point them out. Stuff like pictures and iris scans(with data off-blockchain, possibly linked via a [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)) can definitely help these networks, but humans will use them to help figure out if someone is already in the system.

"Actually in the grand web 3.0 scheme, I'm not sure that tracking the cosign accounts in a contract (ie in the blockchain) is the right way to do it. I think that this should be a wallet feature implemented with some kind of ""wallet storage"" not shared with the world (similar to the HTML5 localStorage). The user should also be able to sync his ""wallet storage"" content on whatever device he use. So for now a contract storage would works, but eventually I think that this is not the right place for this kind of data.

Similarly I think that the transaction should be created directly by the ethereum client (via a Ðapp UI) and not by a ""deployment contract"". I can create whatever contract I want, and in this case I see no reason to require a worldwide blockchain consensus about the creation step itself.

About the merging of vote I agree that a separate vote counter would be a valid solution (and optionally a rejection counter). But as the blockchain is a very expensive storage I feel that the data shouldn't be redundant. My idea was that if voter A and D said `yes`, and voters B, C and E hasn't voted yet we could encode that state as `10010`. Then if voter B says `yes` we simply use the bitwise OR `|= 01000` so the new state will be `11010`.

"I agree with some of the article..

But dont confuse anti-pointing cameras and microphones -attached to insecure devices, developped by google. In a context where leaks have indicated the NSA taps everything and is in looking into mass-compromising machines with anti tech sentiment.

Doing so gives the impression for a complete lack of concern for it. Worse, some parties may try spread this sentiment, and then your associated with them. That said, the microphones are just as bad.. But i am glad to see a sign of a line being drawn somewhere.

Yes, i have worries how security relates to ethereum, btw. We can hope that mass-compromising machines is hard. We can get specially secured machines for these things, i mean it is near hopeless for regular users, to be frank. There are cheap computers that could be used. There are even various schemes where you use multiple computers.. 

For instance you could have two, plus a small one with a display. The first one talks to the internet and can send data to the second. The second can read that data and you read your emails/browsing there. However you cannot easily follow links, instead if you want to follow a link, it sends it to the tiny computer with display. The display shows what link you followed, and you have to press a button to allow the link to be passed on to the internet-connected computer.

For ethereum/bitcoin transactions, the same would happen, except you'd see the transaction on the display.

(mind that [security can involve hardware](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Radio-Transmitter/))

Think that the third option misrepresents UBI... I mean the point is that there are no strings attached.. And why would there suddenly be a committee..

 [**Ethernet**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;**Ethernet** /ˈiːθərnɛt/ is a family of [computer networking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) technologies for [local area networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) (LANs). Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 and standardized in 1983 as [IEEE 802.3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3).  Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as [token ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring), [FDDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface), and [ARCNET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCNET).

&gt;The [Ethernet standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ethernet_standards) comprise several wiring and signaling variants of the [OSI physical layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer) in use with Ethernet. The original [10BASE5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5) Ethernet used [coaxial cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable) as a [shared medium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_medium). Later the coaxial cables were replaced with [twisted pair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair) and [fiber optic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber) links in conjunction with [hubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub) or [switches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_switch). Data rates were periodically increased from the original 10 [megabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabits) per second to 100 [gigabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabits) per second.

&gt;Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called [frames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking\)). Each frame contains source and destination addresses and error-checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted. As per the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) Ethernet provides services up to and including the [data link layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer).

"More intrinsic worth?  Who knows.  All we can look at is the size of the monetary base of both, measured in, say USD.

I personally think bitcoin should be the the ""gold"" that backstops global financial systems and ether will be the ""oil"" that fuels the machinery of the emerging economy.

Ethereum has a constant linear issuance model for ether. (http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) 

If you believe that Ethereum will become a substate for emerging global and social systems, then it is reasonable to believe that the growth of that economy will be exponential for a period (assuming the traditional S-curve adoption model).  If this is true, the value of ether will track the exponential demand more closely than the linear supply.  And I think bitcoin will do something similar.

In the present economy the financial industry is almost larger than the rest of the economy. :-)  Or at least it seems that way.  I don't think such a financialization skew will apply to the emerging economy since it is inefficient.  And I believe the emerging economy will crush inefficiencies quickly.  In this scenario, the ""monetary base"" of ether would likely be larger than that of bitcoin.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

"Why do we need to have enforced rules? What sort of rules?

Afaik Twister basically gives every person a little bit of data that people can access. It has a namecoin-like system to associate things with pretty names.(unlike TOR, see no reason the DHT would have any name other than the 'simple' one, just the one on the blockchain under a name can write to a particular name)

From the [whitepaper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152), its three 'mostly disjoint parts'; blockchain, Distributed Hash Table(DHT), bittorrent-like thingy. That seems to corroborate that there are no complicated rules to enforce, and i read the blockchain part and it only contains user registrations. Found the paper hard to absorb, so may have missed a bit, but from what i read i am pretty sure there is no tough identity data in the blockchain, or rules to deal with. They probably could simply join namecoin, or ethereum, or even both, by just having a little namespace for both.

Btw about twister, hmm probably you can DHT a string, so doing that to URLs.. So presumably it can do a 'comment anywhere'.. A 'documentation everywhere', with some kind of wiki mechanism would be neat too.

Even with a blockchain, why would clients bother to put any information about namecoin in, they can just use the address namecoin tells them is associated on client side, and the blockchain of whatever system they use only needs to know that address. When they want to go back they can just query back client-side too.

The only place where that seems to be an issue is when the namecoin indicates a change of data, like a pubkey for that system. However, the older key would still be in the namecoin system, so finding back the name should be possible..

Hell, in principle ECDSA pubkeys can be the same accross, though people have worry about the security of often-used ECDSA public keys to the point of suggesting not reusing them. Whenever you receive new coin, you can easily change addresses.

 [**Torches of Freedom**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches%20of%20Freedom): 

---

&gt;**""Torches of Freedom""** was a phrase used to encourage women’s smoking by exploiting women's aspirations for a better life during the women’s liberation movement in the United States. [Cigarettes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarettes) were described as symbols of emancipation and equality with men. The term was first used by psychoanalyst [A. A. Brill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Brill) when describing the natural desire for women to smoke and was used by [Edward Bernays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays) to encourage women to smoke in public despite social taboos. Bernays hired women to march while smoking their “torches of freedom” in the Easter Sunday Parade of 1929 which was a significant moment for fighting social barriers for women smokers.

"Somewhere in this subreddit it has been said that GPU will not be helping that much (at least in the first year of mining) and that you will need 0.25 - 1 GB of RAM (for 1 thread). So I guess it would be ideal to have like 8 core CPU and 8+ GBs of RAM. :) However, it will take some months for mining to start - so I would wait for more details before buying HW.

"Let's say they raise 1 thousand bitcoins in the ""IPO"". That means they'll give 1 million ethers to the backers and create 300 thousand for the Ethereum Foundation and release the Genesis block and kickstart the protocol. They protocol will be hardwire to create 400 thousand ethers by year, every year.

So before any mining, there's 1.3 million ethers around. The foundation owns therefore 23% of all ether. After a year of mining, the miners will have added another 400k, getting the total to 1.7 million ethers. The foundation's original 300k now represent 17% of the total. The amount held by the backers and foundation stays the same, but it becomes proportionally smaller every year.

Does this means that the total supply will grow indefinitely? Yes and no. Theoretically yes, at a constant rate which will represent a smaller and smaller % of the total.  But in practice some coins are always lost, going in hard drives in dumpsters, burned paper wallets, forgotten keys and more specifically to Ether, badly coded contracts and unexpected conditions that might lock coins forever. Let's say that every year, 1% of all ether is lost in those situations. This means that after 100 years, when there will be 40 million ethers in the network, 400 thousand of those will be lost in average, and 400k will be created by miners, so an equilibrium will have been reached and the supply will be constant.

"To be honest, doors and cars that would open with private keys who own the ethereum(or other system)token for them sound scary. It takes out the civil society aspect, you know where people follow the rules because thats the customary, moral and ethical thing to do, replacing it with a system where it is completely, and immediately forced.

In particular, for immobilizers for cars, you'd need to have serial devices to reprogram the shit if the token is ever lost. Probably you dont have the firmware that it uses. Of course the contract could have a system where a bunch of other peoples' keys together can make a new token, but that is worthless in emergency situations, or if the block chain ever breaks...

Regarding machines, i'd stick with security systems that can be circumvented by rewiring a bit. The rewiring would even come with some instructions how to do it, but it would be in an inconvenient place, in car, behind the engine.

"From what I've understood so far, Ethereum sounds like a really interesting and potentially transformative idea. The exciting and new thing is the ability to create programmable contracts. I am not interested in making money directly from the currency itself, but rather in the innovative possibilities opened up by the contracts. Unfortunately, the way the currency is being launched might create a barrier to innovation in that actually placing contracts onto the blockchain might turn out to be quite an expensive undertaking (because ether is needed for contract, processing fees etc). In my view for innovation to thrive, ether needs to be cheap and easy to get (by mining).

I think I agree with earlier contributors who have commented that the current plan is a dangerous mix of *great* new idea with a rather ambitious, speculative ""IPO"" style launch; the glitz and the ideas are in tension with one another. A bit reminiscent of dotcom bubble.

"Ether is not stock. Stock is issued by a corporation centrally. In contrast, mining is decentralized and issued slowly, where the price is set by supply from the miners and demand from consumers. If Ethereum really wants to treat ether like stock then there should be no mining what-so-ever: they would be the sole issuers and the public would trade on it on the secondary market; if they needed to raise more funds, they would issue more just like any normal company. However you can't have both a mining model and a stock-market model simultaneously and expect any serious investment in the project. Here's why:

* Ethereum is pledging to be completely open. NXT keeps some of it's development code private and releases open source of the more mature builds. Also NXT has purposefully added a few security bugs that it keeps secret in order to attack any alt coins based on their code, Ethereum has none of that.

"&gt; I mean you're not giving the donors anything. It's pure charity.

Whether or not it's charity depends on whether you plan on being vested in the success of the platform. Say you're an investor and you have 10 BTC to put into ethereum:

Under option A), you give them 10 BTC and they give you some amount of ether that may or may not be overpriced. 

Under option B) you could give, say 5 BTC to the Foundation, then buy 5BTC worth of ether at the market price. Or, give 1BTC to the foundation, then buy 9 btc worth of ether at the market price. Or, give 10 BTC to the foundation, then *don't* buy ether (that's the charity route).

It's not a fork of Bitcoin. We're dealing with lots of complexities and we want to see this technology succeed. That's going to take money and focus. 

In fact, here's my previous post criticizing posts like yours: 

&gt;Arguing against a pre-mine makes sense if you're talking about nothing more than a fork of bitcoin with slight code modifications. After all, what have you really done to earn a pre-mine? But unfortunately this hardline stance on pre-mine has become a standard meme to unthinkingly repeat. Ethereum is starting from an entirely new codebase. A team had to be organized - all of the code has to be written, tested, and audited. There will be many other costs - legal fees, salaries, etc...

&gt;This isn't a simple fork of an already existing coin - it's an IPO of a project which happens to have a decentralized monetary instrument as part of its product.

&gt;If we applied this ""absolutely no pre-mine"" mentality to anything else it would be apparent that your stance makes no sense - let's use farming for an example.

&gt;If we treated farming the way you're treating the ethereum pre-mine we would expect the farmer to buy the land, hire the workers, plow the fields, plant the seed, grow the plants, harvest the crop, and do any other work necessary. Then, instead of getting any of the harvest for himself, or any discount on the vegetables, you scream ""unfair!"" and demand that the farmer put the entire harvest into a huge pile which you and the farmer and everyone else in the town have an equal chance of getting food from.

&gt;This isn't fair. This isn't logical. This makes no sense. We can't expect that people should do massive amounts of work and then compete on equal footing with those who didn't for a piece of the same pie.


We have big plans, and none of them are ""be greedy"" or ""be thieves"". We're facing complex problems in uncharted territory and attempting to solve them in the most elegant way we possibly can. We're not simply trying to release a coin into the wild - we're attempting to bootstrap an entire ecosystem, and we want to be able to do things for the community that have never been done before. That said - I'm sure mistakes will be made. 

If you would like to be part of the solution then it is not difficult to join that dialogue. But screaming ""thieving liars!"" is not constructive and it does not offer any solutions. You're acting as if we're some secretive organization plotting behind closed doors against you, whose attention you must get by being as loud as possible. That is not the case. We are here - but we are also busy. We are doing our best to organize as quickly as possible and engage the community in a meaningful way. It will take some time, we are doing our best.

&gt;

&gt;In [cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and [computer science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) a **hash tree** or **Merkle tree** is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the [hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) of the labels of its children nodes. Hash trees are useful because they allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of larger data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of [hash lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_list) and [hash chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain).

&gt;Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of the given hash tree requires processing an amount of data proportional to the [logarithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) of the number of nodes of the tree;  this contrasts with hash lists, where the amount is proportional to the number of nodes. The concept is named after [Ralph Merkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle).

This coin is open source and will br forked, cloned and renamed, relaunched, the only difference is these guys will be walking away with millions.  If you like the tech go and buy it aftermarket.

"I agree with pretty much everything you said. You'll want a light interface to do name-&gt;identity info lookup, you can use .onion addresses as identity data, merge mine? sure.

The convoluted part is *not* the fact that we're using a blockchain-based tech to store identities. It all sounds well and good. In fact, for what's available now, OneName is perfect.

It gets convoluted when you want your services to interact with the identity info or enforce rules around that identity. You then have to query the name-chain for the info you need, and insert that data into a transaction on another chain. Enforcing service rules based on identity info means you practically need that info stored in whichever chain you are using. Thats why you have Twister using its own name system, instead of just using OneName/Namecoin.

This isn't necessarily an issue at the moment, since there isn't even much of a coherent ecosystem of decentralized services yet. However, once more services are layered on ethereum, I think it will start to make more sense to transfer identities over there.

Then again, perhaps most of this is sorted out when you add an ethereum address alongside the other information in your OneName. OneName can act as a sort of meta-identity system.

"I find the funding model quite intelligent; I like the idea that no matter how much is raised, it is 40% of *that* amount that gets added every year.

Of course the foundation will be sitting on a lot of money to begin with.... but why do you say it is bad? It could be misspent, true; but it is not certain to be misspent merely because it is centralised. 

The fundraiser has been delayed over and over while the development continues, new people are being brought on board, research is being conducted. In funding ethereum at the fundraiser we will thus be voting on whether we like what they've been doing and trust them to continue that way.

So far, I like what the ethereum project is doing. I also trust that we will have plenty more information on their spending plans once the fundraiser is finally underway. And remember, if there is any group of people acutely sensitive to the problem of centralised control, it is these guys.

In a financial contract, ether can be transferred from one account to another, or stored within a contract under certain rules - like a savings account for example.
In these cases ether can represent Bitcoin or any other Cryptocurrency (a contract can actually sign cross chain transactions or use ""local"" currencies that exist on the ethereum blockchain).
  
In a Daap - Ether will be rewarded to the service provider...

If you are referring to the fees that are paid in ether - currently the model they are working on states that fees will be burnt - so they will basically be trashed and cannot be re-used.

"That would imply an authentication. Otherwise how to see if somebody is US citizen or not? 
If they use authentication the ""whale"" problem would be solved as well. 
I dont like authentication much, but otherwise, nearly everybody accept authentication for trading BTC via exchanges as well, there is nearly no exchange out there without KYC style authentication.

It would create an inverse situation to BTC: 

In BTC early adopters got a lot of BTC with mining anonymously, today it is very hard to get BTC anonymously, most people buy them at an exchange and are tracked (company -&gt; state) that way.

With Ether all the investors would get tracked when there is an authentication scheme. But then miners and Ether buyers who use p2p exchanges would get their Ethers anonymously, assuming that with Ethereum we will get decentralized p2p exchanges. Also we can assume that there will be soon anonymizer tools, so even the fund raisers could ""wash"" their money by selling it to themself as anonymized buyer.

So at a result, I do not see much of a problem with authentication from a privacy perspective.
The government (switzerland if the org will be registered there) would have access to the list of fundraisers and their investments. But a fundraiser could sell his investment as soon Ethereum goes live and the tools for obtaining anonymity are in place. Nobody knows later on who is the owner of his investment.

"There is already a forked version without that ""premine"" (I hate that term). I believe the interesting question to ask is: what are the incentives for both sides to develop code?

The ethereum foundation, will have available funds to pay developers, bounties, infrastructure, to pay for travel fees for conferences. If they manage their funds smartly and generously they will create a DAC to manage all the ""pre mined"" funds and those will be distributed transparently to anyone doing meaningful contributions to the platform. Once you are a part of it, everyone will have an incentive to participate on the main chain, and the alt-chains will always be lagging a bit behind in adoption and features.

If they keep their IPO funds only to a handful of people and are seen as mismanaging it as a whole, then everyone will have an incentive to participate on the alternative chains and the original will never have the desired network effect. Maybe if the released code is good enough multiple groups of people will dedicate their time to develop it, but always knowing that their value can be replaced if a new fork happens.

"The base claim here is quite interesting: that tx fees - even in Bitcoin - aren't just a simple trade between the tx sender and a miner, where the sender pays BTC to a miner and the miner processes the (perhaps extra large) transaction. But rather that the rest of the network ""must"" also bear the costs. 

Thus if blocksize were uncapped, the argument goes, miners would process big transactions that are profitable for them (because they receive the entire fee, which exceeds their own costs) but a net loss for the network as a whole (because the cost to the network exceeds the fee). Thus ""tx fees are not a market"" because there's a ""tragedy of the commons.""

One reservation I have is that it's not actually the case that other nodes must bear the cost. They have a choice whether to relay larger transactions and they can set their own blocksize limits. If it becomes unprofitable for the rest of the network to deal in larger blocks, the miners that do will find themselves isolated, will they not? 

More generally, for their to be a tragedy of the commons there needs to be a commons - that is, a rivalrous resource that everyone can consume and that no one can restrict the consumption of. 

For example an unowned lake around which is a ring of houses. If everyone can freely fish the lake, overfishing will destroy it. But the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum seems different: the network node resources seem less like the lake and more like the resources within the houses themselves, where if you allow your house space and tools to be used by others you get to use everyone else's (you get to participate in the HouseShare system). Critically, this does *not* make the housing spaces and tools a commons, because if one is too greedy in their use of other people's things they may simply find themselves cut off from the system by other homeowners.

"No and I consider it to be a closed matter. Dan and I are very different businessmen with both different vision and philosophy. It's better for the ecosystem that we are running separate ventures. I haven't had any involvement or equity in I3 since mid-October- prior to the launch of protoshares nor any involvement in Angelshares or other product launches. 

When I was the CEO, the business plan and the fiduciary obligations of the company were very different and more traditionally structured like a Silicon Valley startup. We had a single investor from China and all shares were owned by employees or associates of the company. I watched the mastercoin fundraiser and was deeply concerned with the lack of clarity about its status as a security in the United States hence I didn't want to embrace a swap style funding mechanism without first having significant legal due diligence and in a host jurisdiction that had more approachable regulators. 

Protoshares was originally intended to be only a market pricing mechanism established by third parties for the overall value of I3 and its promises moving into a series A. In essence, we would have had a number vetted by the traders on the exchanges for what I3 was worth providing a negotiating window for some interested valley VCs. 

At the end of the day, I believed that the primary product wasn't Bitshares but rather Keyhotee and its user base. Bitcoin is a fragmented ecosystem with terrible UX/UI, limited consumer appeal, and almost no emphasis on teaching best practices to protect consumer funds and privacy. Keyhotee was intended to fix these issues by starting as a curated chrome browser extension using an HD Wallet + PGP key generated from the same seed and having tight integration with webmail clients like gmail. One could move to a full featured desktop client via node.js and the mobile space via phonegap. Most importantly, you have a product in front of consumers in a few weeks and they are helping you make it better. That’s called building an ecosystem.  

Bitshares would have been a class of next generation specialized blockchains designed to enable decentralized exchange of any digitized asset- ironically this approach could have worked very well with sidechains. The associated DAC framework I felt was premature, underdeveloped, and also required the more generalized, turing complete framework that Buterin later developed for Ethereum. I don't see how one can claim perfect clarity for how to build autonomous sustainable businesses and then promise specific profits (+5%). When combined with a fundraiser, it seems naïve at best and criminal at worst.      
Honestly, my primary interest in the original Bitshares was the idea of P2P price discovery for cryptocurrencies. Combining this notion with better versions of localbitcoins, one wouldn’t need exchanges for small scale currency swaps allowing mini-satoshi squares to functionally become the ATMS of the developing world. I care very deeply about microfinance and onboarding the unbanked.  

That said, Ethereum does not view itself as a competitor to I3 or its affiliates. We seek to build a comprehensive, open sourced ecosystem that is accessible to all and interoperable with as many standards as possible. The goal here has always been unity and innovation. Focusing on petty personal feuds benefits no one and comes at the expense of time and mental energy.

Imagine a scenario where this Algorithm is enshrined in an Ethereum contract, and drives a DAC. This is what's coming in the very near future.

One question arises, however: in the case of the VC firm, their algorithm is presumably a closely-guarded bit of intellectual property. It provides a competitive advantage that the firm would not want to relinquish.

In the open-source land of Ethereum, there's nothing to prevent anyone from copying an algorithm and using it for their own benefit. So how might DAC operators cope with this challenge?

Perhaps the Algorithm itself could be hosted off-chain, where its code doesn't necessarily have to be visible to all. Perhaps there's simply an understanding that investing in the DAC will provide an opportunity to profit from the Algorithm - even though its inner workings aren't visible.

"There are some similarities: i) Both are the products of for-profit companies, i.e. companies trying to promote their ideas to make money.

Section 2. [**Trust metric**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato#Trust_metric) of article  [**Advogato**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato): 

---

&gt;The motivating idea for Advogato was to try out in practice Levien's ideas about attack resistant [trust metrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_metric), having users certify each other in a kind of [peer review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) process and use this information to avoid the abuses that plague open community sites. Levien observed that his notion of attack resistant trust metric was fundamentally very similar to the [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm used by [Google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) to rate article interest. In the case of Advogato, the trust metric is designed to include all individuals who could reasonably be considered members of the Free Software and Open Source communities while excluding others.

"We will be releasing a huge amount of information in advance of the pre-sale.  All of your questions will be answered in great detail, hopefully to your satisfaction.

That said, I can answer a couple of your issues briefly.

The bulk of the pre-mine is a long-term endowment for the project.  Employee compensation and other expenses will be paid in combinations of ETH, BTC and legacy currency to be specified by the employee.  Most personnel are eager to receive a significant percentage of ETH as part of their regular compensation.  We will be running a radically open and transparent organization.  For instance, salaries will be formula-based and the formula will be published.

The long-term endowment will be released in tranches that are in time-locked contracts.

If you are holding ETH, it would be in your best interest if the company and its personnel were also holding ETH, and were actively working to increase the value of ETH.  Through this mechanism our interests are further aligned.


&gt; We have to trust you will do the right thing with those funds.

You also have to trust us to do the right thing with the BTC used to purchase ETH in the pre-sale.  Not sure how the pre-mine ETH requires more or different trust.

&gt; under what jurisdiction will the foundation operate under?  

&gt; Will a government who is bothered by Ethereum or any of its contracts/DACs go ahead and close the foundation thus hiting a hard blow?

Ethereum will have hubs in many places around the world.  Two major hubs will be in Switzerland and Canada. If either of those jurisdictions turns against cryptocurrencies, the organization will relocate that hub.

Comparing to the Mastercoin kickstart event, no founders got any MSC for free - but rather MSC was awarded only for investment.

It's ok for the ""Ethereum Foundation"" to get a fixed portion of the ethers, because these are indeed reserved for developing the protocol. But awarding an uncapped value of ethers to the founders smells a bit to ""Ripple style"" to me and might cause long term problems later on.

"Unfortunately I'm not aware of any video's but here would be my own personal thoughts on your performance:

* You are comfortable in front of an audience (that is huge, not many people are).
* For the most part you covered the material by addressing the audience directly, and used the slides only as reference (this is good).
* When you didn't know the answer to something you admitted it with good humor.

---

Areas of improvement:

* You tried to cover too much material too quickly and too abstractly. Use concrete examples (Bob and Alice type examples for instance). Smart Contracts are a difficult concept to get across, but are the root of what makes Ethereum exciting. I'd drop the colored coins section entirely and focus on the contracts.

* Obviously the room conditions sucked. I think I overheard one of the audience members offer to drive the presentation software for you. I think holding the laptop in your hand was distracting both for you and the audience. If you have a podium, it isn't a big deal but in those conditions it is probably best to rope one of the audience members into driving the laptop.

--

Overall I think you gave a credible presentation, and what you need more than anything is simply a bit more practice with doing presentations in general. I'd highly recommend looking into joining something like Toastmasters.

Best of luck! :)

P.S. I'd also hint to your videographer that focusing on audience member's laptop screens is kinda creepy.

"Ethereum IS an altcoin. However, the protocol is radically different from the start. There are changes in:

- Distribution of the coins
- Methods of distributing blocks and rewarding on the network
- Proof-of-Work  / Proof-of-Stake implementation
- Transaction script is Turing complete (The only truly revolutionary part here)

All these features should make it suitable to create almost any consensus based application on top of the Ethereum network.

Imagine that the very first computer programs were all coded onto unique hardware everytime. For every application people wanted to build, a company would build or choose a specific chip and implement the corresponding code suited for that application. This was costly and time-consuming. Then somebody created a high level programming language that made it easier to program applications. That made people much more productive and that programming language became wildly popular.

Think of Ethereum as an altcoin that tries to unleash all the potential of decentralized ledgers.

"Thanks for your insightful comments, Vitalik. I look forward to discussing the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Health Insurance at an upcoming Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup. I'll use the opportunity to address the points you brought up and seek out others' feedback as well; in the meantime I wanted to share a few thoughts that come immediately to mind. 

1. Interface: Excellent point. In general, I believe that society's familiarity with centralization (and lack of familiarity with sharing economies) will mean time &amp; energy expended creating a culture shift. Will we see the emergence of AirBnB-like website to facilitate the formation of these autonomous groups? Can these types of matchmaking websites simplify pairing between individuals and healthcare providers to the point that the lay person can subscribe to DAHI with minimal effort?

2. Social/Incentives
In addition to aligning incentives (always tricky in healthcare), there’s also the issue of the composition of the group of (autonomously) insured people. How can we ensure consistency in how healthy/unhealthy each group is, so that we don’t end up with groups of all-healthy people and groups of ultra-unhealthy people? Could this be facilitated by a matchmaking-like website as described in (1)? Or by inherent rules built into the contract to prevent discrimination based on medical conditions? Or rules that group people based on geographic location?

3. Legal: Another excellent point you bring up. I’m excited about the potential to both do great social good, as well as collect initial data, in the developing world. DAHI makes a lot of sense here. I also think there could be opportunities to experiment in the US. I agree that trying to completely substitute health insurance with blockchain would be difficult up front, but physicians, particularly those in private practice, are free to choose how they’re reimbursed. There are even groups of physicians and solo practitioners whose practice consists mostly of private payers, and they could theoretically be good early adopters of DAHI if they are willing to accept Ether/cryptocurrency as reimbursement (at least for a portion of their services).

Thanks for the great feedback. I look forward to discussing further.

I personally don't think the linear inflation is going to catch up with the demand for Ether even in a medium scale adoption of Ethereum.  People are going to spend ether for contract execution and for meta-coins.  The fact that ETH is actually useful in the network as more apps are built means that there will be a constant growth in demand over time.  At that point the inflationary model actually makes a lot of sense and ETH will be profitable to hold.  ,0,t1_cgts9j6,t3_234gu5,t1_cgthh4k,False,,1,False,,1433378361,1397641204,GeorgeForemanGrillz,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,1,,cgts9j6,True,0

Your question though is v. difficult to answer, and TBH, I'm reduced to hunches when trying. But fuck it, this is reddit... Partly because I'm a modernist of a sort. I think cryptocurrencies are a reactionary element of a wider more interesting project worth putting a political wager on (a definition of what this wider project this is exactly defies my articulation—cryptopolitics? Open-source organisation?). Perhaps cryptocurrencies, in liquifying the rancid foundations of state-bank apparatuses, are a necessary stage towards something more radical. I won't lie, I'd like to see everything dialectically flipped: crypto-*un*-currencies, automation of market-bypassed production, relentless social use-need matching... Ethereum, to my knowledge, seems to be the only project that verges toward this side of the wider project, in demonstrating that it takes the trouble of devising a Turing-complete language, emphasising the architecture (potentiality) over unimaginative applications (actuality) of the blockchain, and attempting to define smart-contracts/DAOs—however problematical. It's a material fact that ever more sophisticated forms of automation or smart-contracts now exist, and all we can say for certain is that it's “for better or worse”, yet by the same token, present itself as an opportunity, in *resembling* a project with traction on social formations to come. This is already significant even without having achieved anything, because its practice is to build consequentially. The present is saturated with exhausted, inconsequential organisation; some remain popular simply because they feel-good in their overt impotence and symbolism (#Occupy, Indignados, Democracia real ya, Pussy Riot, Voina...); others because they're integral to hegemony and facilitate corruption (trade unions, parliamentarians, ""radical"" opposition parties...).

"The premise that there will be a significant and dominating economic construct called ""wages"" or like wages in the cryptocurrency-based economy is not a given.  This new economy will likely be very fluid in its organization and in the opportunities it presents.  Groups will spontaneously organize around an idea, execute it and possibly move on when something better comes along.  There will be some stability and some inertia for important and well-executed services.  But the barrier to entry to create a start-up and offer an innovative service will be very low.  And attracting funding for a good idea will be fast and easy compared to today's funding models.  Employment will likely often take the form of partial ownership and dividends and partial compensation in other forms (maybe salary, maybe profit sharing, maybe bounties for projects executed).  Distributed Autonomous Organizations with broad ownership will likely come to dominate when the ecosystem has gained a degree of maturity.

Here is a somewhat relevant paragraph from something I am working on at the moment:

""Ethereum (or something like it) is necessary and inevitable.  It will enable distributed replacements for centralized services.  Hierarchically organized central control of systems and organizations was an optimal paradigm when communication and information sharing was difficult, slow and expensive.  In the context of current information processing and communications systems, rapid, widely distributed consensus becomes a viable organizing principle.  And given the ease and propensity for corruption, damage, subversion or co-opting of centralized control structures by corporate leaders, governments, shadow-government agencies, and criminal organizations, a mechanism for distributed control and governance of organizations will surely be well received.""

So while hierarchy and wage slavery made sense in the old slow, stagnant paradigm, the new fluid, dynamic paradigm will likely see regular and rapid reconfiguration of business and other organizations and compensation structures will reflect that agility. 

That's the big picture, long-term ""profound"" answer -- or at least one possible answer.

There are so many other answers.  Basically the economy will configure itself so that it works, if there are enough participants who find the economy a valuable place to spend their time, effort and money.  

Ethereum will enable the easy of creation of cryptocurrencies and distributed exchanges will facilitate rapid conversions into whatever currency is most appropriate for a given use.  A cryptocurrency that tracks Swiss Francs can be used to pay a wage-earner based in Geneva, while her colleague in Peru can be paid in a cryptocurrency that tracks the Nuevo Sol.  For as long as these are the currencies in which the bulk of living expenses are paid, compensation can be negotiated in them.

"Response from Charles Hoskinson: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.msg4497464#msg4497464

&gt; I'm not going to fully address Dan's concerns here. The questions he listed indicate they either didn't read or didn't comprehend the whitepaper. For example, the entire philosophy of Ethereum is to be a base layer for innovation thus the particular economic model of a DAC running on top of Ethereum is beyond the scope of our design. A person could indeed have dividends in a sub-currency, yet this point seems to have been missed or ignored.

&gt; As for P2P exchange, we have a close relationship with Open Transactions and combined with a namecoin style contract provided in the whitepaper and bitmessage makes a significantly more efficient distributive exchange than is possible with BitShares. Trust is not required as auditing can be done on Ethereum blockchain and we wouldn't suffer any bloat.  

&gt; Things like 7 again demonstrate either a lack of comprehension or ignorance of our design, contracts are more than robust enough to launch a proof of stake subcurrency. 6 seems to ignore ethereum script is turing complete and thus you can compile a language like c++ into it (anyone ever used coffeescript to write js)?

&gt; On a side note, I am honestly curious how Invictus intends on building DACs without a turing complete language? It seems like you would end in an infinite inductive process of having to build a bigger feature set for the next set of DACs. I guess they have a different philosophy and this is fine.

Hopefully not. I think the advantage of Ethereum is that cryptocurrencies get to actually finally be different from each other in very substantial ways.

""mathcoin"", earn money for solving theorems); perhaps a few might even be state-backed.

"Actually I do have a couple of solutions to your problems you have in the dapp section.

In order to create this contract you will either need to have one participant create it and then all other participants join it by sending an ""accept contract"" message. This is the easy way but requires participants checking the code each and every time.

option 2 you can create a ""deployment contract"" using the CREATE opcode (which currently is non-functional but i'm assured will work soon.) So one contract stores the raw bytecode in storage and then upon request can generate the requested contract. (If you wanted to get really fancy you could even over-write placeholders for particular values such as participants. as well as other pieces of the contract) this has the benefit that only this creation contract needs to be trusted. I have been working on this of other contracts where you need to be able to trust that a created contract is of the correct form.

The second thing which i might have a solution too is the tracking of them. This can be easily accomplished by a contract (either the one that created them or one that calls the creation contract.) I have used a linked list structure in DOUG-v3 to track automatically created poll contracts (from a trusted poll creation contract) which would be similar to what you might need.

https://github.com/dennismckinnon/Ethereum-Contracts/blob/master/DOUG/Doug-v3.lsp

If you look at the segment starting at line 93, this runs through the linked list looking for any resolved polls etc. This might be a useful structure for you depending on what precisely you want to do with the ""multi-sig"" contracts.

Oh you also mention using less storage by merging into a single storage location. This almost certainly would be cheaper since storage costs are so high. But of course it depends on how much accessing of the string you need to do since if you need to read every bit from 1:100 its going to cost 200 gas (rough calculation but there are at least 2 operations per bit. 3 if you count memory access) but a test for success is pretty simple you have an on-going counter so you don't have to perform the calculation each time. The one extra storage slot will be worth saving 90+. And of course you premise increasing the counter on the bit value associated with their position not being 1. You could also count rejections if you wanted to clean up whenever there was no way for it to pass. You have a three state thing here so the bit string should only indicate IF they have voted while the rejection and acceptance counters keep track of what they voted.

hope thats helpful

"Essentially, yes, but the problem is that the number of domains is *enormous*, and we may not want to stuff all that into ethereum. The scalability problem isnt solved yet.

So the Merkle tree structure allows you to put a single checksum in there that allows you prove some entry is in a large data set. But the contract itself cant actually do it. Say you buy `google.com` on our system.. Well, the system cannot stop you, but if we get a message from google that it isnt them, we can prove to the contract that google is in the list of domains. But ones not in the domains like  `not_a_domain.com` we cannot because it isnt in the list.

Of course the list would a snapshot of the domains at some time and be public. There would be an interface to check, probably also used when you are buying.

"my thoughts on basic identity system:

contract one:

    human-readable-name → eth address
    eth address → human-readable name

contract two:

    eth address → contract address

contract three (one per identity):

    identity info (only editable by that eth address)

Eth address is the key to everything. Linking things to this allows for contracts to be used by users piece-meal. Some want human names, but not identity info (or use namespace for a different purpose). Some want identity info, but without a human name. Others want to create their own nameserver, but link their the same identity info. The thing that links all of them is you need an ethereum address to edit the network.

We modularize contracts to the level it makes economic sense. Too many contracts = too many lookups/too many transactions to edit links. Too few contracts = not enough reuse/value in using a single chain.

Clients should be clever enough to know which contracts to point to by default (yet change for personalization). All contracts on one chain democratizes the intrastructure by allowing users to select the component contracts that fit their need by simply pointing to a new contract, while keeping control under the same key, and allowing trusted lookups of contract data that underlie the service logic. (small ex: swap contract one with community nameserver (with more protected access, different rules, etc))

As for accessing data from other contracts, the EXTRO command from the ethereum whitepaper looks like it does the trick. Not sure if a method for getting previous block hashes is possible, though.

"&gt; If some of Maidsafe's technologies rise up to the challenge of crossing this bar then we'll be very happy to use them as our backbone.

We will be glad to see you there as well Vitalik. I believe Ethereum is another great project looking to achieve things never previously imagined.  Its tough, easy, happy and sad all at the same time working at this pace and attempting to read everyone about every project. I will try and summarise some key points regarding MaidSafe and hope it helps. 

We have written many papers and attended many events in this journey. We still find it hard to explain (well I do). I think this is not unusual for a big change. Bitcoin is also hard to explain to some folks. 

We will be launched soon and then will get a chance to measure, tune and check all algorithms. We have had a ton of review though over the years (I started all this in 1996 with a decentralised approach to linux servers that I had designed). In recent years since MaidSafe started (2006) I spent 8 months in a non English place to get peace to do the initial design. I then spent nearly a year travelling around Universities explaining and getting peer review. It's not the be all and end all, but we seek critique everywhere so happy to see it actually. We did work early on and spoke with many people in the field such as Vint Cerf and Deborah Gordon (of the Gordon institute in Stanford), presented at a google conference on scalability and a keynote at the british computer society xmas lecture etc. Also spent a lot of time on kademlia implementation and attacks/designs with Mario Kolberg (one of the the authors in the p2p handbook). A couple of us have spent many years on the cryptopp library (Wei's library) and that's a great place for some pretty deep cryptography questions and ideas. So we search everywhere for valid critique. It is a huge system to describe quickly and that seems to be the main reason for misunderstanding in many cases. None of this is proof of the whole network, but there is a lot of research and testing taken place, including three pre &amp; post doctorate research projects we sponsored for simulation and modelling.  Like everyone we try very hard to make sure we get the system tested as we go along. 

We hope to have some papers soon that further explain some the parts you are discussing or querying here. It may not be obvious or well explained how chained consensus groups work and how they prevent birthday paradox and related sybil type attacks. There was a paper on attack vectors from the data part of the network supposed to be available to the mailing list weeks ago, but it is still waiting on registration for the WWRF forum. We should have posted this paper on  arxiv. 

We will probably try and get the routing paper that explains some of the DHT theory underlying this posted in the next week or so. It will help a lot.  Routing relies on a reliable UDP that has pseudo tcp type connection oriented attributes. This has been worked on by Chris Kohlhoff (of c++ ASIO), Anthony Williams (c++ concurrency) and now another great boost developer Nail Douglas. These parts are critical for full decentralisation of all data in my opinion.

Where single entities (i.e. crypto currencies, structured data version handlers) are involved there are also asymm signatures involved as the chain mechanism cannot work for non group id's.  Currently this is RSA 4096 signatures. So there is a  lot we do not explain in detail, but there is a lot to it all (each client on the network has many crypto key pairs for different aspects, as well as revocation pairs).

I hope this helps folks a little, I think the papers will define more clearly and also show some mathematical modelling of some of these points. ",0,t1_cgblrny,t3_217fsm,t1_cgambcf,False,,7,False,,1433063078,1395768938,dirvine,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cgblrny,True,0

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain).

(If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

"I think a Ethereum contract is not a replacement for the lawyers as Gavin Wood sustains, though it could change the profession. Law needs enforcement, the state monopoly guarantees the inforcement. 
Ethereum contract will enforce itself. Therefore a Ether contract is law, I agree. 
But Ether interfacing with the real world is a different thing. I can't steal you your Ether smart property with a well crafted contract and then say: so you didn't understand the contract. This will go through the same consumer protection processes as we have it in ""real life"".

"I havent seen any object in ethereum that really is a contract? Basically, scripts *can* be contracts, by their behavior, but contract isnt neccesarily the right word for it.

I reckon a script can only be a contract if at least one person has a 'intrinsic link' a  to it. Afaict,(but is early) it can only be abusive between people if there are at least two persons 'intrinsically linked' to.

There are scripts with one special party, or zero. The drop-box one basically has zero, anyone can put more coin in the tank to keep the data storage going. However if the storage is very important to a particular person... Maybe it *could* be intriniscally linked. It could for instance prove that a blackmailer has incriminating information it could still force a particular person to pay to it. However, this is an overly technological way of doing something that could also be done by sending a simple message with a hint. But it demonstrates the principle that if scripts link to people isnt neccesarily obvious.

Btw, if a script `stop`s without doing anything, it is invalid and would not get on the blockchain, right? (Or should that be a manual thing?)",0,t1_cfp557h,t3_1yxm07,t1_cfoux9q,False,,1,False,,1432567149,1393422306,Jasper1984,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,1,,cfp557h,True,0

 [**Torches of Freedom**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches%20of%20Freedom): 

---

&gt;**""Torches of Freedom""** was a phrase used to encourage women’s smoking by exploiting women's aspirations for a better life during the women’s liberation movement in the United States. [Cigarettes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarettes) were described as symbols of emancipation and equality with men. The term was first used by psychoanalyst [A. A. Brill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Brill) when describing the natural desire for women to smoke and was used by [Edward Bernays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays) to encourage women to smoke in public despite social taboos. Bernays hired women to march while smoking their “torches of freedom” in the Easter Sunday Parade of 1929 which was a significant moment for fighting social barriers for women smokers.

"I agree that the readability will probably become a key feature. Every single line of my code is commented because if it wasn't I would never have been able to remember what i was doing halfway through!

That said. The assumption that a more efficient contract will be a more honest one is not completely valid. I discovered while doing this that the best way to increase efficiency in these contracts is to order the logical statements in order of nested constraints (so you don't need to check something multiple times) and then in terms of most likely to occur. 

Admittedly these are just minor improvements for this contract because I'm still learning but one example is that a tie game is far more likely then a winner in tictactoe. so at one point I checked if it was a tie game first in order to avoid having to check if player 1 won or player 2 won since those are far less likely.

Relating this back to the discussion. All ""Admin"" powers are located at the end of the contract because they will almost never be used . as such they also won't affect the efficiency of the rest of the program but i could have easily written an admin power that lets me change the game board of a particular game.

Of course there should be ways to detect this... maybe? The problem as I see it. Ethereum has validated what was supposed to happen. as far as the network is concerned this is how things should be. so without reading the code and checking for a backdoor... i'm not sure how you could do it. This program is only 250 lines long But you could easily envision a much longer contract that has a tiny clause around line 892 which allows you to do all kinds of bad things.

for example:

(when (= (txsender) &lt;Your address here&gt;) (suicide (txsender))

That one line would make it possible for you to define a special account which would steal all funds in the contract and destroy the contract.
That could be pretty hard to catch even in the most readable programs...

(Note my tictactoe game has suicide capabilities given to the admin simply because when i was testing this i didn't want to leave a bunch of contracts around with usable funds in them!  Also this isn't a financial contract its just a game. I don't think such a feature would fly in a financial contract. That might be one quick check.

&gt; I'm not going to fully address Dan's concerns here. The questions he listed indicate they either didn't read or didn't comprehend the whitepaper. For example, the entire philosophy of Ethereum is to be a base layer for innovation thus the particular economic model of a DAC running on top of Ethereum is beyond the scope of our design. A person could indeed have dividends in a sub-currency, yet this point seems to have been missed or ignored.

&gt; As for P2P exchange, we have a close relationship with Open Transactions and combined with a namecoin style contract provided in the whitepaper and bitmessage makes a significantly more efficient distributive exchange than is possible with BitShares. Trust is not required as auditing can be done on Ethereum blockchain and we wouldn't suffer any bloat.  

&gt; Things like 7 again demonstrate either a lack of comprehension or ignorance of our design, contracts are more than robust enough to launch a proof of stake subcurrency. 6 seems to ignore ethereum script is turing complete and thus you can compile a language like c++ into it (anyone ever used coffeescript to write js)?

&gt; On a side note, I am honestly curious how Invictus intends on building DACs without a turing complete language?

If the dapps can hold their weight, it could be a slow growth and if there's a killer app out there, the valuation will match the valuation of that dapp. The interesting thing would be if we see more than killer dapp, and then the ether valuation would benefit simultaneously from both as network usage increases.

"The premise that there will be a significant and dominating economic construct called ""wages"" or like wages in the cryptocurrency-based economy is not a given.  This new economy will likely be very fluid in its organization and in the opportunities it presents.  Groups will spontaneously organize around an idea, execute it and possibly move on when something better comes along.  There will be some stability and some inertia for important and well-executed services.  But the barrier to entry to create a start-up and offer an innovative service will be very low.  And attracting funding for a good idea will be fast and easy compared to today's funding models.  Employment will likely often take the form of partial ownership and dividends and partial compensation in other forms (maybe salary, maybe profit sharing, maybe bounties for projects executed).  Distributed Autonomous Organizations with broad ownership will likely come to dominate when the ecosystem has gained a degree of maturity.

Here is a somewhat relevant paragraph from something I am working on at the moment:

""Ethereum (or something like it) is necessary and inevitable.  It will enable distributed replacements for centralized services.  Hierarchically organized central control of systems and organizations was an optimal paradigm when communication and information sharing was difficult, slow and expensive.  In the context of current information processing and communications systems, rapid, widely distributed consensus becomes a viable organizing principle.  And given the ease and propensity for corruption, damage, subversion or co-opting of centralized control structures by corporate leaders, governments, shadow-government agencies, and criminal organizations, a mechanism for distributed control and governance of organizations will surely be well received.""

So while hierarchy and wage slavery made sense in the old slow, stagnant paradigm, the new fluid, dynamic paradigm will likely see regular and rapid reconfiguration of business and other organizations and compensation structures will reflect that agility. 

That's the big picture, long-term ""profound"" answer -- or at least one possible answer.

There are so many other answers.  Basically the economy will configure itself so that it works, if there are enough participants who find the economy a valuable place to spend their time, effort and money.  

Ethereum will enable the easy of creation of cryptocurrencies and distributed exchanges will facilitate rapid conversions into whatever currency is most appropriate for a given use.  A cryptocurrency that tracks Swiss Francs can be used to pay a wage-earner based in Geneva, while her colleague in Peru can be paid in a cryptocurrency that tracks the Nuevo Sol.  For as long as these are the currencies in which the bulk of living expenses are paid, compensation can be negotiated in them.

"For what it's worth, here's what /u/adam3us (Adam Back) had to say about how this affects Ethereum in another thread:

&gt; It should be possible to replicate ethereum fuctionality, or actually fork ethereum FOSS code itself, replace ether with real bitcoin (via the 2-way peg) and run it on a side-chain. If a feature coin can run on a 2-way peg (and its secure &amp; useful) it will be forked and 2-way pegged.  
  
&gt; New law of crypto currency: if it can be 2-way pegged, the project does not need its own alt. If it has its own alt anyway, it will be forked and replaced with bitcoin.  
  
&gt; This is not a new problem, but it highlights the natural limit on profitability and self-defeating nature of alt-shares that try to premine all or part the transactional currrency: any user past a moderately succesful level of use will fork and replace the premined transactional currency. Replacing the currency with bitcoin is neutral and fair. It is just not plausible to imagine a few early speculators owning the entire transactional currency for the world.  
  
&gt; Bitcoin itself is different, its &gt; 50% disbursed, electrically efficiently, and was a genuine ultra high risk speculation in the first few years when most of the disbursement happened. People who mine bitcoin now are not getting rich. Ownership is wide. Anyone can choose any investment level. There is a natural (decentralized) monopoly for durable engineered scarcity (bitcoin), advantages are strong for everyone to use it. Its definitional: if another me-too scarcity displaced bitcoin, neither bitcoin nor the newcoin would be viewed as durable. Starting new scarcity races for feature coins is self-defeating as a funding model with no other feature outside of the source, it can and will be forked if it gets use. Starting new scarcity races is also grossly unfair, coins should have a reason for existence, and making the param-tweaker rich is not a reason.

1. If you look at Bitcoin itself, there are many altcoins that are strictly superior to Bitcoin (eg.

2. The number 29.4% is a complete fabrication. There is an endowment of 0.3x the amount sold (ie. 23.07% of the initial supply), but that's not all for ""us"". The point is to use this slice to support anyone involved in core Ethereum development (and later on not-so-core development), of which one quarter has been distributed to several dozen developers over the past five months but three quarters are still unclaimed. Think of it as an alternative distribution slice for those who don't have powerful CPU/GPUs to mine or money to invest. One of our major challenges is figuring out how to decentralize this distribution mechanism over time. 

3. Unlike the altcoin/Bitcoin case, if anyone comes up with an alt-ethereum, because Ethereum is Turing-complete we can fork the functionality right back into Ethereum proper as a contract, where it will gain the benefit of being able to interface directly with an existing ecosystem of currencies, liquid decentralized exchanges, data feeds, etc.",0,t1_cgs1ive,t3_22ylxq,t3_22ylxq,False,,5,False,Founder,1433348291,1397480564,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,5,,cgs1ive,True,0

To reiterate: currently, there are no apps that use the identity info in a way that needs to be verifiably enforced.

The gist of what I'm saying is that whenever you need to transfer data between (into) chains, you end up needing to bundle both chain softwares together, else use a trusted source of that chain (you have to trust that data). Having verifiable rules based off that info is not feasible.

The beauty of ethereum is that you can *reuse* applications and *securely link* relationships between them. Once you get data into the ether, you have the assurance not only *that* contract can act on the data, but, if stored, other contracts can, as well. There is no disjoint part.

"I agree 'cryptocontract' or 'self-enforcing contracts' would be better words. Cryptocontracts by themselves cant send anyone to jail, of course, and the worst that your wallet itself can do is reach zero. Lack of resources for your own sustainance or other people have to do it.

Also there are a lot of potential scripts that are good out there. Including giving more assurances. For instance you could have a script with your money, but you can only send from it at some set rate. It could have a list of N trusted people, M from which together to change the address. That is one mechanism to stop major accidental mistakes sending money. 

People of course have to be careful what contracts/scripts to use Afaik people can basically only end up with bad contracts if they're stupid(or stupid to act from badly informed information) or too limited in options. Both can happen in the real world already, and rarely does the 'flex' in non-factum contracts actually help anyone. Quite the opposite, from what i hear. Significant rights reductions for loans that happen to be owned by the state, in the Netherlands, they totally changed the rules for retirement funds, and 'mortage' means 'house with loan' here. You cant default and leave the house, you'd keep the remaining debt, on the plus side. (Goddammit my mother said with a regular mortage, if you leave the house at the last moment, everything paid on the house is gone, but that is actually a better situation.. I mean in the former it is all gone and you still have to pay some more..) And the bailouts are also examples where the rules bend, also to our detriment.

I reckon if the rules are bendable they'll usually bend towards those in power. There will be cases where this probably isnt enough. Crypto contracts need to pick their fights.

"Actually I do have a couple of solutions to your problems you have in the dapp section.

In order to create this contract you will either need to have one participant create it and then all other participants join it by sending an ""accept contract"" message. This is the easy way but requires participants checking the code each and every time.

option 2 you can create a ""deployment contract"" using the CREATE opcode (which currently is non-functional but i'm assured will work soon.) So one contract stores the raw bytecode in storage and then upon request can generate the requested contract. (If you wanted to get really fancy you could even over-write placeholders for particular values such as participants. as well as other pieces of the contract) this has the benefit that only this creation contract needs to be trusted. I have been working on this of other contracts where you need to be able to trust that a created contract is of the correct form.

The second thing which i might have a solution too is the tracking of them. This can be easily accomplished by a contract (either the one that created them or one that calls the creation contract.) I have used a linked list structure in DOUG-v3 to track automatically created poll contracts (from a trusted poll creation contract) which would be similar to what you might need.

https://github.com/dennismckinnon/Ethereum-Contracts/blob/master/DOUG/Doug-v3.lsp

If you look at the segment starting at line 93, this runs through the linked list looking for any resolved polls etc. This might be a useful structure for you depending on what precisely you want to do with the ""multi-sig"" contracts.

Oh you also mention using less storage by merging into a single storage location. This almost certainly would be cheaper since storage costs are so high. But of course it depends on how much accessing of the string you need to do since if you need to read every bit from 1:100 its going to cost 200 gas (rough calculation but there are at least 2 operations per bit. 3 if you count memory access) but a test for success is pretty simple you have an on-going counter so you don't have to perform the calculation each time. The one extra storage slot will be worth saving 90+. And of course you premise increasing the counter on the bit value associated with their position not being 1. You could also count rejections if you wanted to clean up whenever there was no way for it to pass. You have a three state thing here so the bit string should only indicate IF they have voted while the rejection and acceptance counters keep track of what they voted.

- Download the AlethZero C++ client from code.ethereum.org. This is important as the builds change all the time

"As Vitalik indicated, we have no idea where the 29.4% number came from.  Any speculations at this point are unfounded.  We are still working out budgets and other financial issues and have not finalized any numbers. 

We are acutely aware of the community sentiment regarding a possible pre-mine.  We are also weighing the value of having ETH to pay salaries which keeps our individual and corporate interests more completely aligned with those of Genesis Sale ETH buyers.  Whether there is a pre-mine or not, we will need to have lots of ETH on day one to pay out obligations (e.g. salaries to developers), to help fund third parties who are developing DApps on Ethereum, and possibly to help stabilize the currency in the early days.  We are looking at ways to reduce the pre-mine significantly and possibly even eliminate it.  If we do end up eliminating it or having a very small pre-mine, we will have to buy ETH in the market which creates other issues.

We certainly don't want the role of a central bank, but in the early days of bootstrapping the system, it may be prudent to ensure that the currency is stable while new businesses on the system are making their services available and figuring out the implementational details of their business models.  Some third parties have already indicated that they are interested in setting up trade desks to stabilize any currency fluctuations (and be paid for taking risks in these activities).  Such groups will likely assist ETH to remain in a non-volatile trading band and they will likely have other businesses that depend on an ETH price that is not excessively volatile.  In the event that there is not enough ETH liquidity at certain times and exchange rates rise rapidly, we may want to have a pool of readily available ETH that we can draw from to reduce drastic upward volatility and enable businesses on the system to operate economically while the economy grows and gains stability. Bootstrapping an economy will be an interesting endeavor.  We expect businesses on the system to figure things out, bottom up, grass roots.  But one thing they don't need to contend with is an excessively volatile ETH price, so we may step in on occasion to dampen large swings.  This is all still under discussion and rest assured that we will default to fully free market dynamics as soon as possible.

So the Merkle tree structure allows you to put a single checksum in there that allows you prove some entry is in a large data set. But the contract itself cant actually do it. Say you buy `google.com` on our system.. Well, the system cannot stop you, but if we get a message from google that it isnt them, we can prove to the contract that google is in the list of domains.

Of course the list would a snapshot of the domains at some time and be public. There would be an interface to check, probably also used when you are buying.

I don't think the team of Ethereum get it. The whole reason that Bitcoin has become so huge is that it's been in the hands of the people since day one. Bitcoin has managed to build a lot of goodwill in the community because of this. The kids who mined in 2009 are some of its strongest proponents and entrepreneurs today.

The importance of community has recently been magnified by the rise of Dogecoin, which started out a joke, but has quickly passed most of the other altcoins with its innovation and utility.

While I think the people behind Ethereum are brilliant, I'm afraid that an IPO will prevent it from truly becoming mainstream. It will be another footnote in 5 years time, alongside all of the other great ideas that never took off (coloured coins, next, ripple etc.). Ethereum needs a strong community behind it, and I don't accept that it's just a marketing exercise (i.e. so let's set aside some funds for a few people to maintain a twitter).

As Amanojack said, the developers will become rich through mining and buying early if the project is even remotely promising in the first year.

"I'm not convinced that stable value is an important or even good objective, at least in the early stages. It removes a major incentive for early adoption. That incentive might be important for overcoming the initial hurdle of being useless because nobody uses the currency yet. In Ethereum's case, I'm wondering what incentive remains for investors if the goal is to eliminate large capital gains.

The idea of changing issuance rates based on difficulty level is nonetheless interesting. My hunch is that there would be little effect on short-term fluctuations, which I think are most damaging to commerce. It would be interesting to check that with historical data on prices and difficulties.

Ultimately, some special provision for a stable value might be more important if the scalability problem is solved.

"The miners will enter into the market but with much less funds slowly over time. And the Investor could sell a few for a high price, the demand will be very high if too many people get locked out of the IPO.

But beside that I think for the future development that power concentration would be very bad. The ether funds of the founders are time-locked so they cannot influence the market, the miners will need much time to create funds and if supply is too low the price will skyrocket, driving more people into mining and makes investment in mining very high, so the price and mining cost will be in an equilibrium.

"The premise that there will be a significant and dominating economic construct called ""wages"" or like wages in the cryptocurrency-based economy is not a given.  This new economy will likely be very fluid in its organization and in the opportunities it presents.  Groups will spontaneously organize around an idea, execute it and possibly move on when something better comes along.  There will be some stability and some inertia for important and well-executed services.  But the barrier to entry to create a start-up and offer an innovative service will be very low.  And attracting funding for a good idea will be fast and easy compared to today's funding models.  Employment will likely often take the form of partial ownership and dividends and partial compensation in other forms (maybe salary, maybe profit sharing, maybe bounties for projects executed).  Distributed Autonomous Organizations with broad ownership will likely come to dominate when the ecosystem has gained a degree of maturity.

Here is a somewhat relevant paragraph from something I am working on at the moment:

""Ethereum (or something like it) is necessary and inevitable.  It will enable distributed replacements for centralized services.  Hierarchically organized central control of systems and organizations was an optimal paradigm when communication and information sharing was difficult, slow and expensive.  In the context of current information processing and communications systems, rapid, widely distributed consensus becomes a viable organizing principle.  And given the ease and propensity for corruption, damage, subversion or co-opting of centralized control structures by corporate leaders, governments, shadow-government agencies, and criminal organizations, a mechanism for distributed control and governance of organizations will surely be well received.""

So while hierarchy and wage slavery made sense in the old slow, stagnant paradigm, the new fluid, dynamic paradigm will likely see regular and rapid reconfiguration of business and other organizations and compensation structures will reflect that agility. 

That's the big picture, long-term ""profound"" answer -- or at least one possible answer.

There are so many other answers.  Basically the economy will configure itself so that it works, if there are enough participants who find the economy a valuable place to spend their time, effort and money.  

Ethereum will enable the easy of creation of cryptocurrencies and distributed exchanges will facilitate rapid conversions into whatever currency is most appropriate for a given use.  A cryptocurrency that tracks Swiss Francs can be used to pay a wage-earner based in Geneva, while her colleague in Peru can be paid in a cryptocurrency that tracks the Nuevo Sol.  For as long as these are the currencies in which the bulk of living expenses are paid, compensation can be negotiated in them.

&gt;

&gt;**Cubieboard** is a single-board computer, made in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. The first short run of prototype boards were sold internationally in September 2012, and the production version as started to be sold in October 2012. It can run Android 4 ICS, Ubuntu 12.04 desktop, Fedora 19 ARM Remix desktop, XBMC media player system, Archlinux ARM  or basic Debian server via Cubian distribution.

&gt;It uses the AllWinner A10 SoC, popular on cheap tablets, phones and media PCs. This SoC is used by developers of the lima driver, an open source driver for the ARM Mali GPU. It was able, at the 2013 FOSDEM demo to run ioquake 3 at 47 fps in 1024×600.

&gt;The Cubieboard team managed to run an Apache Hadoop computer cluster using the Lubuntu GNU/Linux distribution.

"Let's say they raise 1 thousand bitcoins in the ""IPO"". That means they'll give 1 million ethers to the backers and create 300 thousand for the Ethereum Foundation and release the Genesis block and kickstart the protocol. They protocol will be hardwire to create 400 thousand ethers by year, every year.

So before any mining, there's 1.3 million ethers around. The foundation owns therefore 23% of all ether. After a year of mining, the miners will have added another 400k, getting the total to 1.7 million ethers. The foundation's original 300k now represent 17% of the total. The amount held by the backers and foundation stays the same, but it becomes proportionally smaller every year.

Does this means that the total supply will grow indefinitely? Yes and no. Theoretically yes, at a constant rate which will represent a smaller and smaller % of the total.  But in practice some coins are always lost, going in hard drives in dumpsters, burned paper wallets, forgotten keys and more specifically to Ether, badly coded contracts and unexpected conditions that might lock coins forever. Let's say that every year, 1% of all ether is lost in those situations. This means that after 100 years, when there will be 40 million ethers in the network, 400 thousand of those will be lost in average, and 400k will be created by miners, so an equilibrium will have been reached and the supply will be constant.

If the genesis block does not match this table, then it will be trivial to notice this. In fact, we may even opt to have pyethereum generate the genesis block directly from the purchases taken from the BTC blockchain.

If you guys do run a trustless pre-sale, It would set a wonderful precedent.

I'll have to lament here, but it sounds like all purchases with BTC will be transparent in the blockchain, the exchange rate for each purchase will also be transparent, and the genesis block will show that all purchased ether has been generated.

There's just one more important step: ether collection. Will an escrow function be used to hold BTC until ether has been generated/etc. (according to some predefined terms), and will investors be able to collect their investment using a private key?

"Contracts are busy doing all sorts of trustless stuff, which may include locking up ethers and definitely precludes just suiciding. Hell, some of them dont even have owners.

Even if they could be drained, this would make it entirely trustful that the owner sets up the thing the same way.

NameReg doesnt have one.(edit: an owner, i mean) Or does it? Better go check :p Seriously though, in principle it doesnt need an owner.

*A* solution is not a burn-over but basically just forking it and having everyone switch at the same block. You would have the program able to do both protocols at the same time, and have the change take a fairly long time after release. But this is difficult, makes switching non-optional, and it is quite possible that some people will be screwed...(edit: that dont update their clients, it would be entirely preventable by the individuals)

Cant really copy the contracts and burn over the rest either; people anticipating it would stuff everything in a contract that pays them back later. Then it gets copied, they collect the ethers from the contract on both chains, and then burn to double their money.

Hmm, perhaps you can solve that.. you copy over the money and contracts like a fork any, and then also have burn over. It will get doubled either way, for everyone, in effect not mattering.(may halve the displayed value over the real value to illustrate that) If you're on Ethereum 1.0 you're half in Ethereum 2.0, and the burn is to get you all the way there.

"Well, just like in regular economics, if it were too expensive people wouldn't use it and so the price would drop as there gets to be a surplus people want to liquidate their ether and not wait weeks to do so. Same for if the price gets very low, people will utilize the extra value. These balances keep the currency at a value determined by the market, and no one will really know what the market entails until the chips fall.

People writing and using contracts want to entice miners to include their transactions in the new blocks. If the miners demand high prices, people will use it less and they would be forced to lower their demand to maximize profit.

A higher price could very much increase adoption. If the price is very expensive, more people will make a profit mining. It seems that normal computers will not be much worse than ""mining"" rigs and so people might just mine for what they need and forego an exchange altogether.

One thing is for sure, people are going to be using it and it won't get to be prohibitively expensive. What that means will be seen as we don't yet know the true utility of the system and so we can't predict demand. what might seem expensive right now may be justified in how useful it is.

This refers to recently mined ETH.  Sorry for the poor wording.

Only miners bring new ETH into the world after the genesis block.  

There is no ""mining reward reduction.""

In this example, miners bring 18,000,000 ETH into the world each year, in perpetuity.


&gt; If you believe the demand for ETH due to usage and speculation will exceed the liquid supply, then it makes sense to speculate.  Bitcoin's inflation rate has been quite high over the last couple of years, with a sizable monetary base and its price has risen significantly.  I would argue nearly all of this value in Bitcoin was speculative and most still is.  Only recently is a bit of a fundamental economy developing in the Bitcoin space -- yet even much of that is based on choice rather than need: people choose to pay in BTC instead of other available payment methods.  In addition to speculative interest, Ethereum will have a fundamental economy driving demand for ETH from day one.  There will be actual demand for ETH from users and distributed apps that require it and only it to operate.

At this point nobody knows what the supply/demand dynamics will be.  We do anticipate that many purchasers of ETH will do so to hold long term, so that ETH cannot be considered part of the liquid supply.  

We do know that supply will grow linearly.  If you think demand will grow linearly or slower-than-linearly then speculation is a bad idea.   If you think the traditional adoption S-curve will prevail, in which there is a significant exponential growth period of the Ethrereum economy, then speculation might be warranted.

&gt;

&gt;**Gresham's law** is an economic principle that states: ""When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation."" It is commonly stated as: ""Bad money drives out good"".

&gt;This law applies specifically when there are two forms of commodity money in circulation which are required by legal-tender laws to be accepted as having similar face values for economic transactions. The artificially overvalued money tends to drive an artificially undervalued money out of circulation and is a consequence of price control.

&gt;The law was named in 1858 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been stated earlier by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the **Copernicus Law**. It was als ...

&gt;**Zipf's law** /ˈzɪf/, an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics, refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. The law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950), who first proposed it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though the French stenographer Jean-Baptiste Estoup (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf. It was also noted in 1913 by German physicist Felix Auerbach (1856–1933).

"Neo &amp; Bee have given us another unfortunate reminder of the importance of trustless security. I inquired to learn about the best practices that Ethereum can use during their pre-sale and Vitalik was kind enough to respond:

&gt;The pre-sale is blockchain-based, and I have a python script that will be released alongside the other sale materials that will list the table of all purchases. If the genesis block does not match this table, then it will be trivial to notice this. In fact, we may even opt to have pyethereum generate the genesis block directly from the purchases taken from the BTC blockchain.

If you guys do run a trustless pre-sale, It would set a wonderful precedent.

I'll have to lament here, but it sounds like all purchases with BTC will be transparent in the blockchain, the exchange rate for each purchase will also be transparent, and the genesis block will show that all purchased ether has been generated.

There's just one more important step: ether collection. Will an escrow function be used to hold BTC until ether has been generated/etc. (according to some predefined terms), and will investors be able to collect their investment using a private key?

"I don't want to discourage longterm thinking about the DAOogles of the future, but as we are not there just yet, I was hoping to keep one foot on the ground for a moment.  There is great value in thinking about and writing Ethereum contracts that make use of the turing completeness and the crypto primitives to perform complex operations under the watchful gaze of the blockchain.  Still, I think you wave your hands a bit carelessly when you state:
""we no longer care if Alice is a cousin of Bernie, or the devil himself, provided the devil responds to 
incentives and knows how to invest. We don't need to trust them at all."" 
There are of course incentives that live off the blockchain and outside the ethereum economy.  Knowing how to invest is different from executing on that knowledge.  But, if you were not intending to tread on the territory of how meatspace might actually interact with the perfect mathematical crystals of interlocking ethereal contracts, then perhaps I am commenting on the wrong thread.  If by ""investment fund"" you mean some delegation of authority by owners of physical assets to a manager, and the redistribution of real returns from the holding, buying and selling of physical assets, then I think you need to consider the flesh and blood part of the equation.  For example, bringing gold into the ethereum investment universe at some point requires a warehouseman.  She hires guards with big guns to keep the assets safe.  And even though she may issue receipts for that gold in accounts of ethereal splendor, when those guards grow sleepy or are bought off, the value of those receipts will likely drop, suddenly and unhappily.  
Now, I do realize that it is possible to fantasize about a world in which no gold can leave or enter the warehouse without a smart contract insisting on a full accounting, and the weighing machinery itself is protected from false measure by another smart contract tied to a measure judged honest by the consensus of a distributed crowd, etc., etc..  I myself am more interested in what ethereum might be able to do within the sadly flawed world I wake up in each morning.  In this world, delegating portfolio trading authority to Alice IS trusting Alice, and this is a feature of that particular relationship, not a flaw.  I hope other, less rewarding, delegations in day-to-day life can be contracted away.  The ultimate questions are not ""how do we get rid of all trust relationships"" but ""how do we best (most efficiently) move the trust to the activities that are most productive, and make those trusted activities auditable.

"&gt;there would be nothing stopping the miners themselves from creating blocks that are arbitrarily hard to compute.

Can you elaborate on their incentive to do this?

&gt; Bitcoin has the 1 MB limit; Ethereum needs to have either a mandatory fee or a few mandatory limits of its own.

It seems to me that if computational power is already a scarce resource, then why would further restrictions be needed? Shouldn't the market be able to price computing cycles on its own? 

Another thing I'm worried about is that two contracts could cost the exact same in terms of computation power but could represent completely different value to their respective users. This could show up in cases where one needs an important contract to be verified in as little a time as possible so that user may be willing to pay more for miners to prioritize it. Conversely, someone who can't afford to have their contract verified within minutes should be able to pay *something* and have it processed within a day or two. A fully market-driven fee structure should accommodate this.

This also affects people in developing countries who may not be able to afford the minimum transaction fee because it's too expensive relative to the value of the services backing it. It would make sense if they could pay a much lower fee and just expect it to take longer to process.

"&gt; The fact is that the modern world is very different from that past 6000 years in two key ways: increased interdependence between geographic regions, and increased dependence on uncapturable capital (social networks). IMO, both of these together make international warfare essentially nonviable. Now more non-intrusive mechanisms like cyberwarfare, product sabotage and financial warfare, those I can see continuing to play out; in fact, one could argue that many countries are currently engaging in financial warfare against each other right now.

It's nice to hear your views on wider social implications, Vitalik, thanks for taking the time. But this above is overly optimistic, and basic globalisation discourse at that, you must admit: globalisation or distributed power-production networks have long proven themselves to be as much if not more of an exacerbater of transnational hegemonies (military, financial, legal, labour, ...) than they are a force for radical emancipation. All powerful financial-governmental institutions openly subvert their own legal taxation frameworks to off-shore their profits. All belligerant nation-states unsubtly wage their wars assymetrically via unending series of so-called humanitarian interventions. All multi-national corporations worthy of their name exploit cheap, developing nation labour costs. In this sense hegemonic power has been leading and innovating the decentralisation game for decades: far from ""nonviable"" it's vital to its own continuation, as means of re-producing itself. It's imperative not to be naive on how this works.

That said, I am cautiously optimistic about projects like Ethereum as it potentially lowers the entry requirements for autonomous contract production. Relatively small organisations may be enabled to compete with hegemonic institutions at their own game. But what's essential for this to be genuinely emancipatory is for such contract production frameworks to be wedded to non-reactionary political programs, otherwise it will inevitably lapse into exploitative discourse yet again -- only at a microeconomic scale.

Bounties for 'issuance'(effectively, but locked in the contract since the start of ethereum) does have a nice property that the more ethers are worth, the more incentive to forfill the bounty, so if the price goes up, bounties get forfilled, putting more ether in circulation.

"Accessing just the current hash would achieve what you say.(edit: afaict it is best to choose as random seed something that is result of each mining attempt, am i wrong? in that view..) There is no 'arms race' as the computing power for running the contracts has to be in range of the full nodes, and this is easily in range for any the miners interested in an attack like this.

Miners can still just win a block, and then not send it on the network if it doesnt suit their (paying clients)bets. Worse, they can monitor the network and only send winning blocks if they are , they then still have a shot at the block reward.

Tried to look at it in depth [here](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/630/contracts-affecting-miner-behavior), tbh i dont think it is a particularly successful analysis.

* For repeated N bets the standard deviation is σ≈sqrt(N)⋅p⋅(1-p) i.e. it keeps going up even for many small bets, so many small bets could add up to incentive to miner collusion.

* I dont really know how miners and betters come together to create their devious schemes. Certainly when there is a single big player and big miner you should be worried. How the big player pays out to third parties might also be important. (if small miners can use that) The size of income that the colluder can rake in depends on who he can create trustful/trustless relations with.

* The commitment scheme can completely protect parties, if failing to provide the random value committed to implies losing accordingly. That approach can be inconvenient.

* Just realized that a *single* contract succeeding at getting non-influencable, non-predictable result would solve the problem for everyone.

* Say block reward is **B** *plain* dropping can be done when **&lt;w&gt; &gt; B + h**, where **h** is the current bet winnings and **&lt;w&gt;** the expected ones.

* Dropping where you watch the network and have a probability **p** to get in your block if you enter it at the last minute, seeing a competitor that implies winnings **c**, you allow the competitor when **c &gt; B+h**, and you try to inject the one you had otherwise, then expectation of earnings **&lt;e&gt; = p(B+h) + c(1-p)**

  But the threshhold for trying is also lowered. 
* Should figure out increase of earnings to miners? Really that depends, if we can figure out how to get that single contract, the analysis would be moot.

"Your comparison with Satoshi really isn't fair. Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem and brought a completely novel concept to widespread adoption, single-handedly. And even after all that, Satoshi doesn't seem to have spent any coin on himself, after all these years! If Satoshi ever spends his coin, I am sure he will spend the bulk of it for the good of humanity, rather than buying for himself mega-islands/yachts/planes/etc.

If Satoshi had baked into the protocol that even before mining, after 5 years he would get 43% of the bitcoins, you can bet bitcoin adoption wouldn't have been near as big as it was. And I'm sure someone would have forked it to make a fairer bitcoin, which would have grown more popular.

Now compare that with Ethereum. The team has 47 (!) people, is not nearly as big an incremental advance, and has competition already in the form of ColoredCoins, Counterparty, MasterCoin, etc. Granted the scripting idea seems the most advanced I have seen, but that doesn't mean it can't be implemented by others.

"&gt; The fact is that the modern world is very different from that past 6000 years in two key ways: increased interdependence between geographic regions, and increased dependence on uncapturable capital (social networks). IMO, both of these together make international warfare essentially nonviable. Now more non-intrusive mechanisms like cyberwarfare, product sabotage and financial warfare, those I can see continuing to play out; in fact, one could argue that many countries are currently engaging in financial warfare against each other right now.

It's nice to hear your views on wider social implications, Vitalik, thanks for taking the time. But this above is overly optimistic, and basic globalisation discourse at that, you must admit: globalisation or distributed power-production networks have long proven themselves to be as much if not more of an exacerbater of transnational hegemonies (military, financial, legal, labour, ...) than they are a force for radical emancipation. All powerful financial-governmental institutions openly subvert their own legal taxation frameworks to off-shore their profits. All belligerant nation-states unsubtly wage their wars assymetrically via unending series of so-called humanitarian interventions. All multi-national corporations worthy of their name exploit cheap, developing nation labour costs. In this sense hegemonic power has been leading and innovating the decentralisation game for decades: far from ""nonviable"" it's vital to its own continuation, as means of re-producing itself. It's imperative not to be naive on how this works.

That said, I am cautiously optimistic about projects like Ethereum as it potentially lowers the entry requirements for autonomous contract production. Relatively small organisations may be enabled to compete with hegemonic institutions at their own game. But what's essential for this to be genuinely emancipatory is for such contract production frameworks to be wedded to non-reactionary political programs, otherwise it will inevitably lapse into exploitative discourse yet again -- only at a microeconomic scale.

"&gt;You dwell *as* an example in your favor. :-p

I don't understand this, sorry! 

You understand bitcoin better than I, and probably Ethereum too. The complexity I was feeling uncomfortable with was not the scripting - that can, *I hope*, only screw up an application. 

My concern was intuitive, and about flaws in the foundation of Ethereum, such as in what to use for various parameters, and how seemingly innocuous choices about these could have very unexpected effects. I'm thinking chaos theory here, and I think it is naive to expect order and predictability in what will become a very large and complex system. 

Perhaps bitcoin is not that much simpler. I haven't studied the code, or the scripting language. A brief look at that in Ethereum is what made me concerned. 

Creating multiple independent implementations, and other validation techniques are admirable, but there are no methods of conventional software development that can eliminate vulnerabilities of the kind I'm suggesting, in a conventional software system. 

In my scenario, all you can do is make the *system* as a *whole,* robust when things go wrong in unanticipated ways. Biological systems: DNA/evolutionary genetics, cells, organs, organisms, families, communities, ecosystems, GAIA, etc are examples of how to do this. 

You can throw a massive asteroid at GAIA, and she will probably survive. Take out large numbers of humans, or throw a brand new pandemic disease at humanity, and our species would survive, with or without a neocortex and millennia of medical cultural knowledge. Hence my interest in MaidSafe.

You made the point that evolution is slow, but this is not necessarily the case. In the context of finding highly optimised solutions, to very large complex problems, evolution is very efficient, very many times more efficient than random search. Nature is highly optimised for speed as well as resilience, so if the domain calls for this kind of solution, an evolutionary system may well be fast as well as robust. It depends on the complexity of the space being explored. 

However, it may not need to be evolutionary to be resilient, as one could design for a stable environment with known boundary conditions, and create a stable solution modelled on a biologically system for a similar domain. The design process may or may not use an evolution engine, depending on the complexity of the design space.

There are many advantages to doing ETH forwards:

1) traders and investors may have access to tradable assets prior to, during and after any fundraiser and speculate on ETH and vicariously the Ethereum project.

2) we provide a simple way to obtain and track ETH assets while Ethereum's methodology of distribution will be more complex and non liquid with no exchange at the beginning.

"Our general answer is the following:

1. If you look at Bitcoin itself, there are many altcoins that are strictly superior to Bitcoin (eg. Litecoin has 4x faster confirmations, Primecoin has 10x faster confirmations and a slight social utility benefit, Datacoin lets you insert data), and yet all of them combined have maybe 15% of the market cap that Bitcoin has. Network effects seem to be pretty powerful, though as I often argue not nearly absolute.

2. The number 29.4% is a complete fabrication. There is an endowment of 0.3x the amount sold (ie. 23.07% of the initial supply), but that's not all for ""us"". The point is to use this slice to support anyone involved in core Ethereum development (and later on not-so-core development), of which one quarter has been distributed to several dozen developers over the past five months but three quarters are still unclaimed. Think of it as an alternative distribution slice for those who don't have powerful CPU/GPUs to mine or money to invest. One of our major challenges is figuring out how to decentralize this distribution mechanism over time. 

3. Unlike the altcoin/Bitcoin case, if anyone comes up with an alt-ethereum, because Ethereum is Turing-complete we can fork the functionality right back into Ethereum proper as a contract, where it will gain the benefit of being able to interface directly with an existing ecosystem of currencies, liquid decentralized exchanges, data feeds, etc.",0,t1_cgs1ive,t3_22ylxq,t3_22ylxq,False,,5,False,Founder,1433348291,1397480564,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,5,,cgs1ive,True,0

However my understanding is that the SEC rules are on the onerous side. Specifically I know there are lots of rules for dealing with low net-worth investors.

My guess is that the SEC claims jurisdiction if there are US investors involved regardless of where the organization is formed. So it may be that, rather than deal with the unreasonable burden of US regulations, it is easier to simply exclude all US investors.

"For what it's worth, here's what /u/adam3us (Adam Back) had to say about how this affects Ethereum in another thread:

&gt; It should be possible to replicate ethereum fuctionality, or actually fork ethereum FOSS code itself, replace ether with real bitcoin (via the 2-way peg) and run it on a side-chain. If a feature coin can run on a 2-way peg (and its secure &amp; useful) it will be forked and 2-way pegged.  
  
&gt; New law of crypto currency: if it can be 2-way pegged, the project does not need its own alt. If it has its own alt anyway, it will be forked and replaced with bitcoin.  
  
&gt; This is not a new problem, but it highlights the natural limit on profitability and self-defeating nature of alt-shares that try to premine all or part the transactional currrency: any user past a moderately succesful level of use will fork and replace the premined transactional currency. Replacing the currency with bitcoin is neutral and fair. It is just not plausible to imagine a few early speculators owning the entire transactional currency for the world.  
  
&gt; Bitcoin itself is different, its &gt; 50% disbursed, electrically efficiently, and was a genuine ultra high risk speculation in the first few years when most of the disbursement happened. People who mine bitcoin now are not getting rich. Ownership is wide. Anyone can choose any investment level. There is a natural (decentralized) monopoly for durable engineered scarcity (bitcoin), advantages are strong for everyone to use it. Its definitional: if another me-too scarcity displaced bitcoin, neither bitcoin nor the newcoin would be viewed as durable. Starting new scarcity races for feature coins is self-defeating as a funding model with no other feature outside of the source, it can and will be forked if it gets use. Starting new scarcity races is also grossly unfair, coins should have a reason for existence, and making the param-tweaker rich is not a reason.

"&gt; The fact is that the modern world is very different from that past 6000 years in two key ways: increased interdependence between geographic regions, and increased dependence on uncapturable capital (social networks). IMO, both of these together make international warfare essentially nonviable. Now more non-intrusive mechanisms like cyberwarfare, product sabotage and financial warfare, those I can see continuing to play out; in fact, one could argue that many countries are currently engaging in financial warfare against each other right now.

It's nice to hear your views on wider social implications, Vitalik, thanks for taking the time. But this above is overly optimistic, and basic globalisation discourse at that, you must admit: globalisation or distributed power-production networks have long proven themselves to be as much if not more of an exacerbater of transnational hegemonies (military, financial, legal, labour, ...) than they are a force for radical emancipation. All powerful financial-governmental institutions openly subvert their own legal taxation frameworks to off-shore their profits. All belligerant nation-states unsubtly wage their wars assymetrically via unending series of so-called humanitarian interventions. All multi-national corporations worthy of their name exploit cheap, developing nation labour costs. In this sense hegemonic power has been leading and innovating the decentralisation game for decades: far from ""nonviable"" it's vital to its own continuation, as means of re-producing itself. It's imperative not to be naive on how this works.

That said, I am cautiously optimistic about projects like Ethereum as it potentially lowers the entry requirements for autonomous contract production. Relatively small organisations may be enabled to compete with hegemonic institutions at their own game. But what's essential for this to be genuinely emancipatory is for such contract production frameworks to be wedded to non-reactionary political programs, otherwise it will inevitably lapse into exploitative discourse yet again -- only at a microeconomic scale.

"Ether is not stock. Stock is issued by a corporation centrally. In contrast, mining is decentralized and issued slowly, where the price is set by supply from the miners and demand from consumers. If Ethereum really wants to treat ether like stock then there should be no mining what-so-ever: they would be the sole issuers and the public would trade on it on the secondary market; if they needed to raise more funds, they would issue more just like any normal company. However you can't have both a mining model and a stock-market model simultaneously and expect any serious investment in the project. Here's why:

If the price of the IPO isn't *below* the market rate once miners start selling, then everyone who invested early will take a huge loss. This means any rational investor would stay the hell away from the IPO and just wait till ether comes on the market.

"&gt; Even if they could be drained, this would make it entirely trustful that the owner sets up the thing the same way.

Good point. I was assuming a trusted owner of the contract which defeats the purpose of many contracts and one of the amazing novelties of Ethereum.

&gt; A solution is not a burn-over but basically just forking it and having everyone switch at the same block. You would have the program able to do both protocols at the same time, and have the change take a fairly long time after release. But this is difficult, makes switching non-optional, and it is quite possible that some people will be screwed...

Yes, this is one approach. I am a fan of contract-only solutions rather than Ethereum platform solutions. Here is an attempt at a similar fork approach, but contract only:

The new contract in blockchain v2 is initialized with a copy of the state of the old contract in v1.

That's all fine except for the v1 ether tied into the old contract. The v2 contract will have no v2 ether. If they are truly separate chains, then the next step in this solution would require cross chain exchange.

If the new contract is relying on a cross chain exchange maybe it's balances represent IOUs for v2 currency? I'm not quite sure how this could actually work.

It's messy and yet it still appeals to me. For one, it doesn't require waiting on, or convincing, the core Ethereum devs to agree to, or implement. If we want truly trustless then we don't want to give them too much power. The other reason is the I want to handle the case where ""v2"" is not really ""version 2"" but some alternate Ethereum coin, such as æthereum.

&gt; Hmm, perhaps you can solve that.. you copy over the money and contracts like a fork any, and then also have burn over. It will get doubled either way, for everyone, in effect not mattering.

"&gt;You dwell *as* an example in your favor. :-p

I don't understand this, sorry! 

You understand bitcoin better than I, and probably Ethereum too. The complexity I was feeling uncomfortable with was not the scripting - that can, *I hope*, only screw up an application. 

My concern was intuitive, and about flaws in the foundation of Ethereum, such as in what to use for various parameters, and how seemingly innocuous choices about these could have very unexpected effects. I'm thinking chaos theory here, and I think it is naive to expect order and predictability in what will become a very large and complex system. 

Perhaps bitcoin is not that much simpler. I haven't studied the code, or the scripting language. A brief look at that in Ethereum is what made me concerned. 

Creating multiple independent implementations, and other validation techniques are admirable, but there are no methods of conventional software development that can eliminate vulnerabilities of the kind I'm suggesting, in a conventional software system. 

In my scenario, all you can do is make the *system* as a *whole,* robust when things go wrong in unanticipated ways. Biological systems: DNA/evolutionary genetics, cells, organs, organisms, families, communities, ecosystems, GAIA, etc are examples of how to do this. 

You can throw a massive asteroid at GAIA, and she will probably survive. Take out large numbers of humans, or throw a brand new pandemic disease at humanity, and our species would survive, with or without a neocortex and millennia of medical cultural knowledge. Hence my interest in MaidSafe.

You made the point that evolution is slow, but this is not necessarily the case. In the context of finding highly optimised solutions, to very large complex problems, evolution is very efficient, very many times more efficient than random search. Nature is highly optimised for speed as well as resilience, so if the domain calls for this kind of solution, an evolutionary system may well be fast as well as robust. It depends on the complexity of the space being explored. 

However, it may not need to be evolutionary to be resilient, as one could design for a stable environment with known boundary conditions, and create a stable solution modelled on a biologically system for a similar domain. The design process may or may not use an evolution engine, depending on the complexity of the design space.

I don't think the team of Ethereum get it. The whole reason that Bitcoin has become so huge is that it's been in the hands of the people since day one. Bitcoin has managed to build a lot of goodwill in the community because of this. The kids who mined in 2009 are some of its strongest proponents and entrepreneurs today.

The importance of community has recently been magnified by the rise of Dogecoin, which started out a joke, but has quickly passed most of the other altcoins with its innovation and utility.

While I think the people behind Ethereum are brilliant, I'm afraid that an IPO will prevent it from truly becoming mainstream. It will be another footnote in 5 years time, alongside all of the other great ideas that never took off (coloured coins, next, ripple etc.). Ethereum needs a strong community behind it, and I don't accept that it's just a marketing exercise (i.e. so let's set aside some funds for a few people to maintain a twitter).

"Different things, like for instance [Iris scans](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/790/verifying-unique-identity-iris-scans-and-a-web-of-trust) have been suggested. And it inevitably comes up in the idea of [Democracy-DAO](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/447/democracy-dao)s or [UBI](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/461/basic-income).

With things like iris scans, the problem is often that yes, those measurements do have relation to if the person is human, and it may even be hard to do if the person isnt co-operating. However, you can't really use the measured data in ethereum. I cannot exclude the possibility that there is no way to have a contract use the data.. But i have my doubts.

To be honest, i think there is a better chance trying to create a human identity by having a network of humans with some incentive to add 'true nonduplicates' and an disincentive against duplicates, or an incentive to point them out. Stuff like pictures and iris scans(with data off-blockchain, possibly linked via a [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)) can definitely help these networks, but humans will use them to help figure out if someone is already in the system.

The GPG web of trust is sort-of similar and there has been a lot of research into trust networks and reputation systems, which are probably relevant.

"I actually support pre-mining as a means to fund developers. What I'm wondering is how they came up with the 20-30% number. Ethereum will either be successful or not in the long term. If it's not, no percentage will be worth anything. If it will be successful, even 5% of the whole currency will be worth a ton of money, and should be more than enough for all developers and investors.

Take Bitcoin for example: 5% of 21 million bitcoins is currently valued at half a billion dollars. Would that not be enough for the developers? Imagine if bitcoin was 30% premined at 6 million coins. I think it could have potentially damanged bitcoin and its growth.

My opinion is if the premine were only 5% (ok, maybe 10% total as a compromise), there would be much less risk of a successful fork, it would have more supporters, and the devs/investors would still have a great incentive to make the project work in the long term.",0,t1_cgtvjje,t3_234gu5,t3_234gu5,False,,2,False,,1433379906,1397655515,walden42,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cgtvjje,True,0

Besides, chemically the same processes is used by *many* creatures, and i dont believe for a second it couldnt be done better. Evolution clearly has a lack of ability to actually inovate.

Nature simply isnt going to create the next cryptocurrencies.

Moreover if you programmed it, I cant help but wonder if 'evolution' and 'self healing' that is programmed is simply hiding security holes behind the complexity of those things.

Anything else than humans are notoriously *not at all* equipped to create such systems. Look at the freaking timescales on evolution.

"The market price is ultimately going to depend on:
1) Supply vs. Demand: Does demand exceed supply, and does growth of demand exceed inflation.
2) Usefulness of the protocol: Can Ethereum really do what the founders think it can do?
3) Ecosystem: Will people develop awesome apps to take advantage of the protocol?
4) Will transaction fees (payable only in ether) be set at the appropriate level (or float to the appropriate level) so that the protocol isn't too cheap or too expensive to use.

You are using a supply-side argument--that the people generating the ether will just pluck a price out of thin air, which may be cheaper than the presale price. I'm using a demand-side argument--that the price of ether will float based on how demand relates to supply. If this thing is amazing, then demand is likely to severely outstrip supply.

Remember back when Gmail first came out, how revolutionary it was? How everybody wanted one of those coveted beta invites? People were actually selling beta invites--something the ""right people"" could get for free. Why were people paying for something that was designed as a free service? Simple--it was amazing, and they wanted to use it RIGHT NOW rather than in a year, and supply (limited by the number of beta spots) was overwhelmed by demand.

So with ether, there will be a set amount...1.5X...available in the beginning, and then 0.0333 per month after that from mining (total of 0.4X per year).* So...does Ethereum do amazing things which causes an influx of users/speculators to buy up lots of ether in order to use or speculate? Or does it languish, with all that ether just sitting there with no buyers? That depends on the strength of the protocol, the ecosystem, and in no small part, the marketing.

"First of all let me say that I'm elated with the direction that the Ethereum team is taking regarding mining. It's thinking in the right direction.

I am a little bit concerned that making it fool proof may end up making it so complicated that we create edge cases that get exploited once the ledger is live.

I think the major problem with mining algorithms is that they are misnamed.

Mining is not about expending effort or, finding things or even being decentralized (although the last one is a subset of the intent).

“Mining” is about hosting, protecting, processing and appending the ledger of active transactions. It would probably more ideally be called “Maintenance”. Maintenance needs to be set up in such a fashion that those doing the maintaining never have an incentive or alternatively never get an opportunity to mess with the original intent of the blockchain. Decentralization seems to mesh well with this intent.

The design of ASICs that do general purpose computing is bit of a contradiction in terms. If ASICs emerge that maintain the original intent of the ledger, I cannot see how resisting them would be anything but inefficient to the intent of the ledger. They would be an incredible boon to computer science as they would essentially be “blockchain machines”. If a group becomes dominant (which will happen anyway, if we succeed at general purpose, Amazon will become the dominant Ether mining company), they will have to do so because they “maintain” the blockchain better, cheaper, faster than anyone else.

"See, that's the problem; I don't think that way. If there's one question that keeps me awake at night, it's the thought that perhaps everything I've sank my life into for the past 3 years is a technological and ideological dead end, and perhaps traditional centralized institution-based mechanisms based around corporations and banks and governments and incremental innovation respecting the existing establishment are actually the best way for society to move forward in solving the issues that really matter for the majority of people.

"&gt; I mean you're not giving the donors anything. It's pure charity.

Whether or not it's charity depends on whether you plan on being vested in the success of the platform. Say you're an investor and you have 10 BTC to put into ethereum:

Under option A), you give them 10 BTC and they give you some amount of ether that may or may not be overpriced. 

Under option B) you could give, say 5 BTC to the Foundation, then buy 5BTC worth of ether at the market price. Or, give 1BTC to the foundation, then buy 9 btc worth of ether at the market price. Or, give 10 BTC to the foundation, then *don't* buy ether (that's the charity route).

&gt;I don't see why miners should be rewarded but people funding initial development should not.

When you speak of ""reward"" what you're really talking about is profit. If a donor goes with option A and the IPO turns out to be overpriced, they are *guaranteed* to lose money when they sell. It's just bad investing. How can you call option A ""rewarding the donors"" if it maximizes their chance of losing money?

Edit* another way to look at it:

Option A) Place a bet on the foundation's ability to accurately undervalue ether before it's even traded on the market

Option B) Bet on the foundation's ability to build a kick-ass platform. Make your *own* assessment about the long-term value of ether.

"&gt; If some of Maidsafe's technologies rise up to the challenge of crossing this bar then we'll be very happy to use them as our backbone.

We will be glad to see you there as well Vitalik. I believe Ethereum is another great project looking to achieve things never previously imagined.  Its tough, easy, happy and sad all at the same time working at this pace and attempting to read everyone about every project. I will try and summarise some key points regarding MaidSafe and hope it helps. 

We have written many papers and attended many events in this journey. We still find it hard to explain (well I do). I think this is not unusual for a big change. Bitcoin is also hard to explain to some folks. 

We will be launched soon and then will get a chance to measure, tune and check all algorithms. We have had a ton of review though over the years (I started all this in 1996 with a decentralised approach to linux servers that I had designed). In recent years since MaidSafe started (2006) I spent 8 months in a non English place to get peace to do the initial design. I then spent nearly a year travelling around Universities explaining and getting peer review. It's not the be all and end all, but we seek critique everywhere so happy to see it actually. We did work early on and spoke with many people in the field such as Vint Cerf and Deborah Gordon (of the Gordon institute in Stanford), presented at a google conference on scalability and a keynote at the british computer society xmas lecture etc. Also spent a lot of time on kademlia implementation and attacks/designs with Mario Kolberg (one of the the authors in the p2p handbook). A couple of us have spent many years on the cryptopp library (Wei's library) and that's a great place for some pretty deep cryptography questions and ideas. So we search everywhere for valid critique. It is a huge system to describe quickly and that seems to be the main reason for misunderstanding in many cases. None of this is proof of the whole network, but there is a lot of research and testing taken place, including three pre &amp; post doctorate research projects we sponsored for simulation and modelling.  Like everyone we try very hard to make sure we get the system tested as we go along. 

We hope to have some papers soon that further explain some the parts you are discussing or querying here. It may not be obvious or well explained how chained consensus groups work and how they prevent birthday paradox and related sybil type attacks. There was a paper on attack vectors from the data part of the network supposed to be available to the mailing list weeks ago, but it is still waiting on registration for the WWRF forum. We should have posted this paper on  arxiv. 

We will probably try and get the routing paper that explains some of the DHT theory underlying this posted in the next week or so. It will help a lot.  Routing relies on a reliable UDP that has pseudo tcp type connection oriented attributes. This has been worked on by Chris Kohlhoff (of c++ ASIO), Anthony Williams (c++ concurrency) and now another great boost developer Nail Douglas. These parts are critical for full decentralisation of all data in my opinion.

Where single entities (i.e. crypto currencies, structured data version handlers) are involved there are also asymm signatures involved as the chain mechanism cannot work for non group id's.  Currently this is RSA 4096 signatures. So there is a  lot we do not explain in detail, but there is a lot to it all (each client on the network has many crypto key pairs for different aspects, as well as revocation pairs).

"&gt; There is currently a lot of reasearch/discussion going on in direction ""identity services which does not violate the p2p ideology""

Well, Qubic (cryptocurrency) uses such an approach to counteract Sybil attacks:

When a new entity wants to join the network of peers it must pay for that by providing some PoW. This ""payment"" is sent to each peer and derived from the peer id, so the entity can't send the same PoW to all the peers.

Imagine that the network already has 100 peers. 101th peer must do PoW 100 times. When the network has 250 peers, 251th peer must do PoW 250 times. And so on.

This approach looks quite p2p-compatible, IMHO.

Ethereum miners already have equipment to do PoW, u could make them to ""pay"" for joining the network before they r given a permission to mine blocks. U don't need identity service in this case and don't need to worry that someone pops up out of thin air and do a 51% attack.

"Great seeing you at the expo Piotr!

&gt; Well, in Ethereum each account and each contract have their own data storage. There is no centralized data storage, which means custom data can only be stored in this way. This in turn means that there will never be one unique DNS in Ethereum, just a set of DNSs each different for each contract that creates them. Depending on which one you will read from, you may get different results for the same domain.

I'll answer this by analogy:

&gt; In the traditional DNS system, there is no single centralized data storage server, which means that there will never be one unique top-level domain; just a set of top-level domains with one for each country or organization that creates one. Depending on whether you go to bitcoin.com or bitcoin.org, you may get different results from the same domain.

Same argument applies here. A few namecoins will likely become the most popular, and everyone will refer to them.

&gt; Next, the currency needs an issuer, which makes things more complicated.

Actually, you can create issuer-less currencies. All you do is keep a running counter of the last block and allow one transaction per block to automatically assign an additional X units to the block.coinbase. If you want a currency that can track the US dollar or gold or the CPI, then yes, you need either an issuer or a financial derivatives scheme plus price feeds, which we have quite openly admitted is somewhat more complicated.

&gt; Another approach that might work for this could come in a form of Ethereum having awareness of what happens in other currencies. One could create a contract that creates a piece of currency in Ethereum each time a transaction sends money to a given address in say, Bitcoin. This approach would work well if you want to have proof-of-burn currencies, but wouldn't work too well if you would want to redeem the currency back in its original blockchain, unless that system would have some knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain. 

Umm... I think there was an announcement made a few days ago that [pretty much solved](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/12349/side-chains-challenges-potential/) that particular issue.

&gt; Now the question is, what incentive would anyone have to be putting that data into the blockchain?

Two possibilities. (1) as a loss leader for other services (just like the free APIs provided by blockchain.info), (2) the contract would require a one-cent micropayment in order to access it from another contract.

&gt; If we wanted to include data in a trust-less way for say, a transaction happening in Bitcoin, we would need to provide the transaction data, then add the merkle branch and a block header to prove that the transaction is a part of a block, and then perhaps an entire block header chain to show that the blocks are not fake?

Basically, you need to have a contract which acts as a self-contained SPV client for the external blockchain. I describe it somewhat more in detail in the above linked article on side-chains.

&gt; What is the incentive of creating useful contracts in Ethereum? 

Same thing that incentivizes people to write open-source libraries now. That usually means either (1) it's useful enough that your personal benefit from the contract outweights the cost, or (2) as something to show off and draw attention to yourself when seeking out customers or employers. Incentive of development is likely 20x lower, true, but cost of development is also 20x lower.

&gt; If you create the most useful service there is but the only way to communicate with it is through a command line or creating some code, few people will use it. Similarly in Ethereum creating a contract might only be half of the job. The other half would be creating a good user interface for people to be able to use your contract in a meaningful way. I think this aspect is not emphasized enough at this point and may put a lot of people off when they get their first impressions of Ethereum.

It's not emphasized enough at this point because the GUI toolkits do not yet exist. They will soon, and it's been in the plans for a long time to switch emphasis to the interface side at that point.

&gt; I personally think the Ethereum team might benefit from having a more extrovert person that focuses on explaining Ethereum to non-technical people, and bringing in Vitalik to focus on the technical aspects of what they are developing. Using Vitalik for everything isn't all that optimal.

Agreed. I would love to see Charles and Gavin out there more. I'm much better as a coder and cryptoeconomist than to talk to every public audience out there. We need a balance.

&gt; Lets name all the denominations

People only need to remember ether, finney and wei. The others are just there for future-compatibility. The reason why I added different names is because I think it's ridiculous what's going on in Bitcoin now where everything costs 0.0xx BTC, and if it goes up even more it will start costing 0.00xx BTC or x mBTC. Forcing everyone to say ""zero point zero zero"" or ""milli"" every time when that's the de facto default anyway is cruel and unusual punishment.

"There are some similarities: i) Both are the products of for-profit companies, i.e. companies trying to promote their ideas to make money.  (Bitcoin, of course, started as an altruistic, intellectual experiment without the profit motive)  ii) Both have venture funding and both are tapping into the cryto-currency community for even more funding.  We all know about Ethereum's controversial upcoming IPO.  Invictus has issued Protoshares and Angelshares.  iii) Both are trying to sell something beyond a decentralized currency, unlike the vast number of altcoins presently available.  iv) Both are pushing very complex concepts, certainly well beyond the core idea of Bitcoin.  And it's no surprise that there are similarities, given their common history.

Differences:  Ethereum might be summarized as a toolbox for building decentralized entities and organizations.  Bitshares is just one example of such an entity, so that illustrates the key difference.  Bitshares (the flagship product of Invictus) claims to be a de-centralized exchange that uses the blockchain to enforce a non-terminating, non-delivering prediction market for the price of pretty much anything.  They are also touting a 5% annual return on any BitAsset.

"&gt; Decentralized contract protocols like Ethereum have already technically robbed sovereign power of its usefulness in the regulation of financial matters

Really? Because countries are already regulating Bitcoin and it would take one push from some powerful lobbyists for the US to ban cryptos and the for the experiment to all but end. Not to mention, the a lot of fiat -&gt; crypto in the US and other countries is entirely regulated due to regulations sites like Coinbase have to follow.

You also need to think about where you are going with this. Because direct democracy and decentralized corporations sound great on paper but in practice will have some flaws. We could imagine some scenario where national borders are all but eliminated and what remains are decentralized organizations. What drives those organizations? Anonymous stockholders with no loyalty to nationalities? Will we see race to the bottoms with horrible working conditions, rampant pollution (who cares if your neighbor has smog if you don't have it), etc because all that drives it is profit?

Decentralization is good, but be careful what you wish for. You should also keep in mind that some people have a very strong desire and reason for power to stay centralized.

"Essentially, yes, but the problem is that the number of domains is *enormous*, and we may not want to stuff all that into ethereum. The scalability problem isnt solved yet.

So the Merkle tree structure allows you to put a single checksum in there that allows you prove some entry is in a large data set. But the contract itself cant actually do it. Say you buy `google.com` on our system.. Well, the system cannot stop you, but if we get a message from google that it isnt them, we can prove to the contract that google is in the list of domains. But ones not in the domains like  `not_a_domain.com` we cannot because it isnt in the list.

Of course the list would a snapshot of the domains at some time and be public. There would be an interface to check, probably also used when you are buying.

"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table.

A distributed turing-complete modular reward and payment system with plugins/libraries to different cryptocurrencies doesn't seem impossible to me, even if you'd need a separate blockchain for each app or category.

I also have some issues with the whole investors getting the ethers thing. I would understand them wanting to invest in the organization developing Ethereum with the intent of opening up fertile investment options(applications) in the future. But I don't understand the need for bagholders introducing drag and uncertainty in the transaction network where only ""miners""(computation and storage providers) and the application developers seem to have a direct interest?

"I agree 'cryptocontract' or 'self-enforcing contracts' would be better words. Cryptocontracts by themselves cant send anyone to jail, of course, and the worst that your wallet itself can do is reach zero. Lack of resources for your own sustainance or other people have to do it.

Also there are a lot of potential scripts that are good out there. Including giving more assurances. For instance you could have a script with your money, but you can only send from it at some set rate. It could have a list of N trusted people, M from which together to change the address. That is one mechanism to stop major accidental mistakes sending money. 

People of course have to be careful what contracts/scripts to use Afaik people can basically only end up with bad contracts if they're stupid(or stupid to act from badly informed information) or too limited in options. Both can happen in the real world already, and rarely does the 'flex' in non-factum contracts actually help anyone. Quite the opposite, from what i hear. Significant rights reductions for loans that happen to be owned by the state, in the Netherlands, they totally changed the rules for retirement funds, and 'mortage' means 'house with loan' here. You cant default and leave the house, you'd keep the remaining debt, on the plus side. (Goddammit my mother said with a regular mortage, if you leave the house at the last moment, everything paid on the house is gone, but that is actually a better situation.. I mean in the former it is all gone and you still have to pay some more..) And the bailouts are also examples where the rules bend, also to our detriment.

I reckon if the rules are bendable they'll usually bend towards those in power. There will be cases where this probably isnt enough. Crypto contracts need to pick their fights.

About there not being social problems to solve. Well crowdfunders almost certainly created projects that would not exist otherwise. Donations are much easier with bitcoin, and so might bounties.(or donations that are automatically slowly released and can be stopped, as a way to ensure the donations are used for a particular goal) Could be important for open source for instance.

"&gt; Of course the foundation will be sitting on a lot of money to begin with.... but why do you say it is bad? It could be misspent, true; but it is not certain to be misspent merely because it is centralised.

Personally I would want greater assurances than ""the money might not be misspent"". The point is there is no transparency, they have not given a detailed breakdown of what they are going to spend it on. Even then I would be highly sceptical of any promises given.

&gt; So far, I like what the ethereum project is doing. I also trust that we will have plenty more information on their spending plans once the fundraiser is finally underway. And remember, if there is any group of people acutely sensitive to the problem of centralised control, it is these guys.

"*What do you think is the most tangible way that Ethereum could change cryptocurrency?*

Well, I think right now one thing that worries people a lot is Mt. Gox. So there's the question: we've got this decentralised currency that is supposed to make everything trust-free, and yet in the ecosystem we still have centralised trust and that trust just failed us for 400 million dollars. So there's lot of people are talking about this question of can we decentralise more? Can't we make exchanges do less? Can we make exchanges handle just exchanging and not store bitcoins? Can we make Bitcoin wallets that combine the benefits of storing the bitcoins yourself and storing the bitcoins in a centralized way so that you don't have to trust yourself or anyone else. So basically there's a lot of interest into these different kinds of protocols, how they can actually be done. And the way Ethereum's playing into that is just the fact that Ethereum provides a contract system. It creates this mechanism through which anyone can experiment with all these different setups and create different kinds of contracts, pretty much in about 30 seconds. So once people set up any kind of rules that they want, and basically let the best transaction types win. So I'd like to see things like decentralised exchanges exist, I'd like to see things like decentralised financial systems exist, where there is no Mt. Gox at all.

*I'd like to ask just one more question. So is this a shift away from putting trust in an individual, trust in a financial institution, with the trust then being going into the protocols of the system itself, like algorithmic?*

Yes. So any trust that's still there either be in large coalitions of people, so things like 5-out-of-9 voting pools, or the blockchain, or the trust should be in maths.

*So what do you think are the possible effects of quantum computing, and the way that will effect cryptocurrencies and mining in general?*

So in terms of mining, quantum computers are somewhat better at mining, but they can't beat mining completely, so we if quantum computing comes out, all we're going to see is the difficulty a notch up by a few billion and it'll just keep going. The bigger threat is, I would say, from the signature side. So there are quantum-proof signature algorithms to replace ECDSA, but they're all more inefficient in some fashion, and it's a much more untested area of interest. 

*Do you think it'll be some time before quantum computing will provide a bit of a threat to traditional mining?*

Look, the fact is, the most powerful quantum computer in the world managed to use Shor's algorithm to factor the number 21. These things are a joke. It will be a long time before they are successful. And once we see some kind of [unintelligible] event where the NSA's been doing it all along, I don't think they're any more close to reality and when they will be, we'll have lots of time to [unintelligible].",0,t1_cfzeoru,t3_200x6d,t1_cfytvuj,False,,3,False,,1432744950,1394495879,bgeron,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,3,,cfzeoru,True,0

With respect to number three, I agree, but don't forget that all those things are made possible by infrastructure that has been built (and is maintained) with government involvement. Also, especially in the West, democracies have moved toward more liberal policies in regard to social welfare, etc., that the majority may not be willing to completely abandon to decentralization.

Even so, the potential social benefits of Ethereum are endless. Decentralized trust systems, contract systems, identity systems, even political systems (to some extend).

"Why would you donate bitcoins, if you need them later to purchase ethereum.

I think if you view it from a capital allocation model, you would need to rely on a very efficient group think to allocate enough bitcoin to get ethereum rolling, but then have enough capital leftoever to realize a investment in ethereum when it goes live, and that this scenario vs a premine IPO would provide a better return.

Also what happens when the donation drive fails, then ethereum has to come back with the IPO model.

I think the IPO model should go forward, I would like to see a better understanding of how the bitcoin raised gets spent, and also how the ethereum gets allocated.  My issue isnt the premine, its that they are getting BTC upfront, and they are getting ethereum pre allocated to special parterns and early angels. Which means I am funding ethereum with my bitcoin but I getting diluted by other insiders, when we are taking the exact same risks at such an early stage. Unless I am mistaken.

Much more disclosure needs to happen, also I am concerned that no-one in the team has any experience handling or managing large project money or organizations.   Funding 5-10-20 million is no small sum without a some business management experience.

Why on ethereum? Because not only humans can talk to contracts, contracts themselves can aswel. You could have a company owned by employees. Unfortunately there is always the chance of some asshole running with the money. An ethereum contract can formalize discretionary spending, limiting it, and anyone can watch the users. If that contract also handles the name via a namecoin, the employees cannot run with the domain name and other names either.

"We will be releasing a huge amount of information in advance of the pre-sale.  All of your questions will be answered in great detail, hopefully to your satisfaction.

That said, I can answer a couple of your issues briefly.

The bulk of the pre-mine is a long-term endowment for the project.  Employee compensation and other expenses will be paid in combinations of ETH, BTC and legacy currency to be specified by the employee.  Most personnel are eager to receive a significant percentage of ETH as part of their regular compensation.  We will be running a radically open and transparent organization.  For instance, salaries will be formula-based and the formula will be published.

The long-term endowment will be released in tranches that are in time-locked contracts.

If you are holding ETH, it would be in your best interest if the company and its personnel were also holding ETH, and were actively working to increase the value of ETH.  Through this mechanism our interests are further aligned.


&gt; We have to trust you will do the right thing with those funds.

You also have to trust us to do the right thing with the BTC used to purchase ETH in the pre-sale.  Not sure how the pre-mine ETH requires more or different trust.

&gt; under what jurisdiction will the foundation operate under?  

&gt; Will a government who is bothered by Ethereum or any of its contracts/DACs go ahead and close the foundation thus hiting a hard blow?

Ethereum will have hubs in many places around the world.  Two major hubs will be in Switzerland and Canada. If either of those jurisdictions turns against cryptocurrencies, the organization will relocate that hub.

I am sorry but at this point they are not doing unique things - maybe 2 months ago but not now.

And in this world a week makes all the difference.


People will shift quickly to the platform thatis most fair and least centrally contrrolled becuas ethat and only that means the contracts and companies they struggle to create over months or years will have the best chance to survive. 


Another thing.

If everythingis fee based why couldnt the founders always ""walmart"" the competition in every profitable sphere?

For example you do a roulette wheel casino contract with the least possibler margin covering the fees of the contract executing. But the founders can duplicate your contract and underbid you by operating at a loss for a while until theirs is the most widely known Casino name name and they clear the field (that's means you are gone or irrelevant). 

Then they raise their margins in the contract (slightly reduce payout) and rake it in.

They can do this on every single contract innovation anyone comes up with.

So can any whale who buys in.

It worries me.

"You *should* link to the [issuance model](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper#wiki-currency-and-issuance). X ether is bought, total of 0.5X goes to others. 0.225X would be time-locked, probably with a script, so verfiably so. 

0.4X is mined per year, the premine is very acceptable. 

I think the developpers ether share is a little high. They could vary the issuance to themselves as dependent of the ammount of BTC-bought. Idea being that the larger the community, the smaller the fraction of that community is developpers, so their share should be smaller. Also, the ammount of ether bought is an indicator for the potential success of ethereum, so the more is bought, the more ethers are kindah worth, and so the smaller the fraction is to provide some level of value. (The expectation of value of the premine should aways increase with buy-in)

If they want more ether, developpers could buy ether by donating BTC to some charities or something.(dont burn BTC for this purpose, it's silly)

Forks... Well afaik there is no way around it. This is why we basically need to try keep users of cryptocurrencies somehow focussed on developpers and knowledgable people. The lame-ass clones of course shows that a few of them can be convinced, but the effect looks larger than it is if you look at volumes.

"Ethereum has two languages, E-CLL (the language people write in) and ES (the language that contracts execute); I'll answer the question for both separately.

E-CLL is a proof of concept. Right now, it's basically a subset of Python, with the exception that integers are modulo 256. Ultimately, I hope that it gets expanded to cover all of pure Python, and other languages are written that

ES has a few specific requirements:

(i) High level of deduplication. We are in a unique situation where thousands of people's code is stored in a common database where we can choose the format, and we should take advantage of that. Ultimately, I want to erase the distinction between functions, code-blocks and libraries.
(ii) Simplicity. The fewer ops the better.
(iii) Optimization-friendliness.

The question is, what is the right tool for the job?

There are 4 main solutions to the problem:

1. Assembly-like language with jumps
2. Postscript-like language with concatenation and functions
3. Lisp-like language with functions and recursion
4. Some moderately simple language that actual humans code in, like Lua

Ethereum 0.0.1, as old-timers might recall, was purely (1). Then, on the advice of Andrew Miller, Paul Snow and others, I switched to stack-based, but still with jumps. Now, we are looking at something similar to (2). You might notice that ES2 is actually almost exactly like Postscript, except that we are using hashes-as-pointers as a possible alternative to including lists directly and we don't have arrays, dicts, variables or first-class functions. However, Gav Wood's criticism of (2) is that it's imposing a preference for a certain set of control structures (IFELSE, WHILE, function calling) by fiat, whereas a jump-based approach lets the compiler create whatever control structures it wants.

(3) is interesting and highly elegant, primarily because Lisp is designed to be extensible so it might be possible to use an existing Lisp interpreter (although that might also be problematic, since we do heavily rely on 20-32 byte strings and ints and all existing machines are 4-byte or 8-byte). I also like the Lisp approach from a philosophical standpoint, in that it has a very high level of simplicity by reducing everything to functions - an interesting parallel to the assembly approach of reducing everything to jumps. However, my main qualm with Lisp is that Lisp is fundamentally a functional language designed around immutable data structures, and Ethereum is fundamentally a state machine. 

(4) is a bad idea, since humans' coding preferences change. Sure, we can pick a language that people like coding in now. But 10 years down the line, people might invent some completely new paradigm, and we would end up with people writing compilers down to Lua - a much more shaky and untested field than compiling down to register-assembly, or stack, or even Lisp. 

Ultimately, I think the optimal ES design should be decided on based on what the actual applications are that people want to use. We have a person trying to implement a clearinghouse, as well as many other applications, and we'll see how the language can be tweaked to make such applications work better.",0,t1_cf77k0m,t3_1x0ebg,t3_1x0ebg,False,,7,False,Founder,1432254960,1391559453,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cf77k0m,True,0
"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it""  I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.  

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward.  Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

If you do it on your own, you'd probably have to put it on Cryptsy or whatever, which may or may not accept your currency, because they have to support your wallet, secure it and so on, while on Ethereum much of that stuff will be automatic and much easier to implement.

"I'm not involved with Ethereum so I can't answer for what will be there from the start, apart from saying that things which can not be currently done, will not be in Ethereum from the start :p 

Now, there is several issues at hand here though. One is to keep keys and password secure attackers that might steal the resources they protect, another is ensure a computation has been executed correctly. 

My current understanding, hope vbuterin will correct me if I say something wrong here, is that Ethereum scripts will be executed by the miners, which ensure they will be executed correctly. Now once you have obfuscation, you could add obfuscated code to the blockchain, or maybe even external services like Maidsafe, which an Ethereum script might then tell someone to execute. So basically, once obfuscation technology matures,  if you want to upload a script to the blockchain, you run it through an obfuscator first, then upload the obfuscated script. The obfuscator just would be a local program that you would run on your computer, so Ethereum itself doesn't really need any special support for this. 

I have some related questions myself that perhaps someone knows the answer to?

What are the plans regarding IO operations in scripts? Allowing a script to make an arbitrary network connection opens many possibilities, but has a lot of security issues. As I understand in, the current version is Turing-complete, but when it comes to IO, its mainly just that a contract can store some data in the block chain.

How scalable are Ethereum scripts? What would be required to make it work with millions of large complex scripts? Would the SNARK stuff from that lecture perhaps be useful to offload some computations?",0,t1_cfavqo3,t3_1xfee7,t1_cfav4n9,False,,2,False,,1432320374,1391953333,cyberfax,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cfavqo3,True,0

Really? Because countries are already regulating Bitcoin and it would take one push from some powerful lobbyists for the US to ban cryptos and the for the experiment to all but end.

The act of taking a profit-making contract and turning it into its equivalent non-profit is what I dubbed ""[emancipation](http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/737/emancipate-eman-ci-pate-verb)"", because it liberates the contract from its owners (in the shareholder sense). The means of production (the contract) is no longer the *property* of anyone.

"Another thing that I think is very important. 
I feel that Ethereum is not only about bitcoin 2.0, it s a new paradigm for the whole crypto world, whether it is bitcoin or altcoin.
Therefore, I feel that ethereum should give also the possibility for altcoins holders to invest as equitably as possible compared to bitcoins holders. Ideally being able to invest other cryptos than bitcoin would be awesome but i understand that it is not possible. So those altcoins holders (like myself) would sell some of their alt holdings for some bitcoins. But it would be only a few bitcoins.
It seems like a lot of ideas that have been used to create ethereum come from altcoins such as LiteCoin (hard-memory scrypt), PrimeCoin (1mn block), Peercoin (PoS) so it would be logical that Ethereum gives back a little to the alt-community by letting altcoin holders invest in an equitable way.

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain). So note that nTransactions and nBlocks is going to be at least linear in time (just like Bitcoin) but the contract memory requirements (the most radical change in scalability characteristics from Bitcoin) is proportional to the number of contracts but does not necessarily continually grow over time. (If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

But running a simple little script is part of every transaction, and if they open things up, you'll be able to do somewhat more complicated transactions. (Kickstarter-style pledge drives is one example.)

The ethereum devs believe they've figured out a way to build a full-fledged programming language into their coin, and have strong security for it. This would allow all sorts of new features to be added by anyone, just by writing scripts instead of modifying the client and getting everybody to upgrade.

Having a full programming language means someone could write an infinite loop (doing the same thing over and over forever) and lock everybody's client. So the script has to pay as it goes for the computation it's doing.

"Why do we need to have enforced rules? What sort of rules?

Afaik Twister basically gives every person a little bit of data that people can access. It has a namecoin-like system to associate things with pretty names.(unlike TOR, see no reason the DHT would have any name other than the 'simple' one, just the one on the blockchain under a name can write to a particular name)

From the [whitepaper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152), its three 'mostly disjoint parts'; blockchain, Distributed Hash Table(DHT), bittorrent-like thingy. That seems to corroborate that there are no complicated rules to enforce, and i read the blockchain part and it only contains user registrations. Found the paper hard to absorb, so may have missed a bit, but from what i read i am pretty sure there is no tough identity data in the blockchain, or rules to deal with. They probably could simply join namecoin, or ethereum, or even both, by just having a little namespace for both.

Btw about twister, hmm probably you can DHT a string, so doing that to URLs.. So presumably it can do a 'comment anywhere'.. A 'documentation everywhere', with some kind of wiki mechanism would be neat too.

Even with a blockchain, why would clients bother to put any information about namecoin in, they can just use the address namecoin tells them is associated on client side, and the blockchain of whatever system they use only needs to know that address. When they want to go back they can just query back client-side too.

The only place where that seems to be an issue is when the namecoin indicates a change of data, like a pubkey for that system. However, the older key would still be in the namecoin system, so finding back the name should be possible..

Section 2. [**Trust metric**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato#Trust_metric) of article  [**Advogato**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato): 

---

&gt;The motivating idea for Advogato was to try out in practice Levien's ideas about attack resistant [trust metrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_metric), having users certify each other in a kind of [peer review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) process and use this information to avoid the abuses that plague open community sites. Levien observed that his notion of attack resistant trust metric was fundamentally very similar to the [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm used by [Google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) to rate article interest. In the case of Advogato, the trust metric is designed to include all individuals who could reasonably be considered members of the Free Software and Open Source communities while excluding others.

I was at an event last weekend and told ten people in person about Ethereum. None of them could get the spelling of Ethereum right, just by hearing the name, when I recommend them to write down a note about Ethereum. And once they will learn about the premine they won't invest.

&gt;

&gt;**Gresham's law** is an economic principle that states: ""When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation."" It is commonly stated as: ""Bad money drives out good"".

&gt;This law applies specifically when there are two forms of commodity money in circulation which are required by legal-tender laws to be accepted as having similar face values for economic transactions. The artificially overvalued money tends to drive an artificially undervalued money out of circulation and is a consequence of price control.

&gt;The law was named in 1858 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been stated earlier by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the **Copernicus Law**. It was als ...

Still i prefer the idea of a separate id-contract . However, the second contract doesnt seem neccessary because k∈{0,1} should be fine.

"We feel your frustration, Djanash.

The good news is that we are moving forward on all fronts and being very productive, especially on the software development aspect.  Proof of Concept 5 is developing beautifully and will be released fairly soon.

We have put a great deal of time, effort and money into two critical projects (among many others) that we need to complete before offering the sale of ether (ETH).  

First, we have developed and built a state-of-the-art multisig, hot/cold wallet system that uses a variety of hardware and software technologies to ensure that no adversary, external or internal (or natural/unnatural disaster) can cause the loss of the BTC revenue.  We are in the late stages of internal testing of the system and then it goes to outside audit for review.  We will open source the design of the system (though not all specific implementational details) so that other groups can benefit from this work.

We have done even more work on the legal front.  We have been working, and continue to work with lawyers in different countries to structure the pre-sale of ether so that it is not seen by securities regulators as an offering of securities.  We believe that selling ETH, a fuel that powers applications on the Ethereum platform, does not constitute sale of a security, be we hope to achieve more certainty before starting the sale.  The is an extremely important issue in our industry.  We believe we have a chance of pioneering business structures that can revolutionize this niche and be acceptable to regulatory bodies.  

We have also done a large amount of work to design how we as a company (of tech geeks who don't know their ass from their elbows :-) ) will operate in a manner that the community will respect.  In short: we intend to run a radically open and transparent organization.  But we do need some bootstrap time to put systems in place.  Coordinating a global project takes a lot of thought and effort.

The bottom line is that while we continue to work and build and attract businesses to the ecosystem to offer distributed application services, the public's understanding of what we are building will grow and their decision to purchase the fuel for their business applications to run will be further informed.  We will release quite a bit of information before the sale, so hopefully all of your questions will be answered in good time.  If not, we are here to address any queries.

But running a simple little script is part of every transaction, and if they open things up, you'll be able to do somewhat more complicated transactions. (Kickstarter-style pledge drives is one example.)

The ethereum devs believe they've figured out a way to build a full-fledged programming language into their coin, and have strong security for it. This would allow all sorts of new features to be added by anyone, just by writing scripts instead of modifying the client and getting everybody to upgrade.

Having a full programming language means someone could write an infinite loop (doing the same thing over and over forever) and lock everybody's client. So the script has to pay as it goes for the computation it's doing.

"Ethereum has two languages, E-CLL (the language people write in) and ES (the language that contracts execute); I'll answer the question for both separately.

E-CLL is a proof of concept. Right now, it's basically a subset of Python, with the exception that integers are modulo 256. Ultimately, I hope that it gets expanded to cover all of pure Python, and other languages are written that

ES has a few specific requirements:

(i) High level of deduplication. We are in a unique situation where thousands of people's code is stored in a common database where we can choose the format, and we should take advantage of that. Ultimately, I want to erase the distinction between functions, code-blocks and libraries.
(ii) Simplicity. The fewer ops the better.
(iii) Optimization-friendliness.

The question is, what is the right tool for the job?

There are 4 main solutions to the problem:

1. Assembly-like language with jumps
2. Postscript-like language with concatenation and functions
3. Lisp-like language with functions and recursion
4. Some moderately simple language that actual humans code in, like Lua

Ethereum 0.0.1, as old-timers might recall, was purely (1). Then, on the advice of Andrew Miller, Paul Snow and others, I switched to stack-based, but still with jumps. Now, we are looking at something similar to (2). You might notice that ES2 is actually almost exactly like Postscript, except that we are using hashes-as-pointers as a possible alternative to including lists directly and we don't have arrays, dicts, variables or first-class functions. However, Gav Wood's criticism of (2) is that it's imposing a preference for a certain set of control structures (IFELSE, WHILE, function calling) by fiat, whereas a jump-based approach lets the compiler create whatever control structures it wants.

(3) is interesting and highly elegant, primarily because Lisp is designed to be extensible so it might be possible to use an existing Lisp interpreter (although that might also be problematic, since we do heavily rely on 20-32 byte strings and ints and all existing machines are 4-byte or 8-byte). I also like the Lisp approach from a philosophical standpoint, in that it has a very high level of simplicity by reducing everything to functions - an interesting parallel to the assembly approach of reducing everything to jumps. However, my main qualm with Lisp is that Lisp is fundamentally a functional language designed around immutable data structures, and Ethereum is fundamentally a state machine. 

(4) is a bad idea, since humans' coding preferences change. Sure, we can pick a language that people like coding in now. But 10 years down the line, people might invent some completely new paradigm, and we would end up with people writing compilers down to Lua - a much more shaky and untested field than compiling down to register-assembly, or stack, or even Lisp. 

Ultimately, I think the optimal ES design should be decided on based on what the actual applications are that people want to use. We have a person trying to implement a clearinghouse, as well as many other applications, and we'll see how the language can be tweaked to make such applications work better.",0,t1_cf77k0m,t3_1x0ebg,t3_1x0ebg,False,,7,False,Founder,1432254960,1391559453,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cf77k0m,True,0

"I'm glad you asked about this.  I had the same question.

I can't do this: contract.storage[1000] = ""gnomecoin"" can I?
If that's allowed it take up [1000] to [1008] storing each character as a numeric ASCII value using RLP.  Each ethereum address then would take 20 bytes (slots), right?

I can do this: contract.storage[tx.sender] = 200 a la key value store.
But if I do contract.storage[1000] = tx.sender then I need to eat the 20 slots, right. 

There is currently a one time ether fee for storage, but it's refundable when storage is no longer used (e.g. suicide or overwrite to 0).  They may change this.  It's specified in the whitepaper: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Ethereum-TOC

Users could then submit their contracts with a payment-per-click figure, and miners would select contracts to process based on the highest return-on-click. By keeping state across blocks, there would not be any problem of figuring out which contracts to choose because each chosen contract will get executed to completion or run out of wei.

"Essentially, yes, but the problem is that the number of domains is *enormous*, and we may not want to stuff all that into ethereum. The scalability problem isnt solved yet.

So the Merkle tree structure allows you to put a single checksum in there that allows you prove some entry is in a large data set. But the contract itself cant actually do it. Say you buy `google.com` on our system.. Well, the system cannot stop you, but if we get a message from google that it isnt them, we can prove to the contract that google is in the list of domains. But ones not in the domains like  `not_a_domain.com` we cannot because it isnt in the list.

Of course the list would a snapshot of the domains at some time and be public. There would be an interface to check, probably also used when you are buying.

Tl;dr a technical solution to not loading every domain name on the blockchain requires that domains can be taken away retroactively. Suppose you may argue that we're putting ourselves in the role of 'hoarder of names', trustful in some respects.. Can try decrease trust by spreading authority regarding decisions of assignment.

"I think I understand what you mean. I believe the complete opposite, I think Ethereum is going to reduce scams if not eliminate them altogether. 

First, it's currently impossible to obfuscate contract code, so all contracts will be in clear text. Anyone pretending to create a contract and not delivering on its promise (frontend/backend schism) would be immediately flagged a scam both by the users of the said site AND on chain. Just like if amazon kept 33% of the credit card numbers to buy themselves fancy paintings, I think we'd know. Ethereum is about to add decentralized, Sybil attack proof reputation systems on top of all that. 

Second, in order to be trustless and decentralized most if not all contracts of an 'escrow' nature would have to have 100% if not more collaterals attached to them, on both sides. Hard to scam if users automatically get their money back.

Third unlike the financial derivates in today's financial world, derivatives in Ethereum would be backed by Ether, or even Bitcoin, and not debt. Good as gold.

Fourth Ethereum makes the building of such services so trivial than consumers will never have been in such a powerful position to 'vote with their feet'. Worrying that someone could scam others with Ethereum is the same as worrying that someone could ask for a cc number on a website today, then disappear the day after. Ethereum will create an ecosystem where anyone acting without proper escrows, total transparency and 100% honesty will be out of business in no time.

"Ether is not stock. Stock is issued by a corporation centrally. In contrast, mining is decentralized and issued slowly, where the price is set by supply from the miners and demand from consumers. If Ethereum really wants to treat ether like stock then there should be no mining what-so-ever: they would be the sole issuers and the public would trade on it on the secondary market; if they needed to raise more funds, they would issue more just like any normal company. However you can't have both a mining model and a stock-market model simultaneously and expect any serious investment in the project. Here's why:

If the price of the IPO isn't *below* the market rate once miners start selling, then everyone who invested early will take a huge loss. This means any rational investor would stay the hell away from the IPO and just wait till ether comes on the market.

"I agree that the readability will probably become a key feature. Every single line of my code is commented because if it wasn't I would never have been able to remember what i was doing halfway through!

That said. The assumption that a more efficient contract will be a more honest one is not completely valid. I discovered while doing this that the best way to increase efficiency in these contracts is to order the logical statements in order of nested constraints (so you don't need to check something multiple times) and then in terms of most likely to occur. 

Admittedly these are just minor improvements for this contract because I'm still learning but one example is that a tie game is far more likely then a winner in tictactoe. so at one point I checked if it was a tie game first in order to avoid having to check if player 1 won or player 2 won since those are far less likely.

Relating this back to the discussion. All ""Admin"" powers are located at the end of the contract because they will almost never be used . as such they also won't affect the efficiency of the rest of the program but i could have easily written an admin power that lets me change the game board of a particular game.

Of course there should be ways to detect this... maybe? The problem as I see it. Ethereum has validated what was supposed to happen. as far as the network is concerned this is how things should be. so without reading the code and checking for a backdoor... i'm not sure how you could do it. This program is only 250 lines long But you could easily envision a much longer contract that has a tiny clause around line 892 which allows you to do all kinds of bad things.

for example:

(when (= (txsender) &lt;Your address here&gt;) (suicide (txsender))

That one line would make it possible for you to define a special account which would steal all funds in the contract and destroy the contract.
That could be pretty hard to catch even in the most readable programs...

(Note my tictactoe game has suicide capabilities given to the admin simply because when i was testing this i didn't want to leave a bunch of contracts around with usable funds in them!

"&gt; Nobody, including Satoshi had an advantage at any time during the project's history.

Absolutely false IMO. Satoshi had the advantage that he knew about Bitcoin from day 1, and he posted the information on a specific set of forums that he chose and not on other forums. 99.9999%+ of the world's population had no chance whatsoever to do anything with Bitcoin simply because they didn't know about it before 25% of all currency units that will ever exist were released. Meanwhile, in Ethereum, I specifically forced the project to have an infinitely growing currency supply so there is no such thing as ""25% of all currency units that will ever exist"" in the first place.

I have a question regarding hedging contracts.  Vitalik stated person A could put 1000 into a contract, and someone else, person B, could put 1000 and speculate whether the price of something will go up/down and profit on that.  What benefit does person A have?  Can they turn any sort of profit?

"My biggest concern about Ethereum is that it seems to be set up to be a real estate grab where a few people who put together ideas and code made by many which are NOT unique are going to own the platform that will tax every transaction on the platform.

Every contract, every (not really) Autonomous corporation (not so autonomous if running on a platform some centrally controls is it? wanna build a company there?) , every everything will pay a few for every actiona dn the profits fromthe fee will go in large proportion to the group that premined.


I am sorry but at this point they are not doing unique things - maybe 2 months ago but not now.

And in this world a week makes all the difference.


People will shift quickly to the platform thatis most fair and least centrally contrrolled becuas ethat and only that means the contracts and companies they struggle to create over months or years will have the best chance to survive. 


Another thing.

If everythingis fee based why couldnt the founders always ""walmart"" the competition in every profitable sphere?

For example you do a roulette wheel casino contract with the least possibler margin covering the fees of the contract executing. But the founders can duplicate your contract and underbid you by operating at a loss for a while until theirs is the most widely known Casino name name and they clear the field (that's means you are gone or irrelevant). 

Then they raise their margins in the contract (slightly reduce payout) and rake it in.

They can do this on every single contract innovation anyone comes up with.

So can any whale who buys in.

It worries me.

I am not interested in making money directly from the currency itself, but rather in the innovative possibilities opened up by the contracts. Unfortunately, the way the currency is being launched might create a barrier to innovation in that actually placing contracts onto the blockchain might turn out to be quite an expensive undertaking (because ether is needed for contract, processing fees etc). In my view for innovation to thrive, ether needs to be cheap and easy to get (by mining).

I think I agree with earlier contributors who have commented that the current plan is a dangerous mix of *great* new idea with a rather ambitious, speculative ""IPO"" style launch; the glitz and the ideas are in tension with one another. A bit reminiscent of dotcom bubble.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

I think one problem is the conflation of the mechanism to reward developers and the the mechanism to control contract execution. The success of ethereum depends on the ability to deploy and execute novel kinds of contracts - i.e. it will work best if there is a low barrier to deploying contracts = low value ether. Whereas using ether as a reward depends on it having a high value.

"&gt; Trusting ethereum contracts.

Ethereum is just a platform on which to build distributed applications.  You may as well be asking why would the layman ever use a computer because you have to be an expert to understand the microarchitecture of the CPU.  

&gt; Is ether destroyed?

I thought I read that this is being considered.  Anyway, this is matter of balancing the incentives of miners, users, early adopters, late adopters, and investors.  It is a tricky problem to get right, but it doesn't really matter too much in terms of technology.

&gt; What is the function of ether being divisible to 18 decimal places?

I am not an ethereum dev, but my guess is that since integers are 256 bits anyway, adding the extra precision has no drawbacks.  I agree that it is a bit crazy, but you have to draw the line somewhere and it is better to have too much precision than too little.  Again, it is rather arbitrary.

&gt; Is ethereum an oxymoron?

"Afaics every script that is somehow a 'permanent fixture', with no connections to particular people, and that somehow never loses too much funds to get deleted is essentially equivalent to being a feature of ethereum. 

I cant answer your question, but the above implies ubfuscating privkeys into ethereum itself, not scripts would do the same.

Also, that is a *strong* statement. I.e. if you could for instance have 'magic infinite funds' for something like the [dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflsmuz), basically having that file could be used for mining! 

Note afaict the dropbox scheme does not actually pay for serving the data to people.. Got [a concept](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1yvr3a/bitcoins_price_fall_will_affect_ethereums_launch/cfoa3j4) for that too, but with inflation subsidy servers would create fake viewers. Basically it cant be taken for granted that mechanisms cant be played.

Still, many scripts could be subsidizable with inflation, and not be fraudable.(i dont quite know)

Anyway, a little inflation may be a good thing, but it does beg the question who should get the coin. Regular mining is wasteful, so these are interesting, and that it can be done with script is aswel. Perhaps sub-currencies of ethereum could do it internally.

That said, i dont quite know how to give such a sub-currency value, ethereum itself could presumably only do it, but we currently only have relatively limited practical knowledge of scripts. Voting on scripts that would subsequently get some limited-to-the-desired-inflation 'magical funds' is an idea, but voting might presumably done by weight of coins, so there is a danger to overcentralization of coin through it..

"The base claim here is quite interesting: that tx fees - even in Bitcoin - aren't just a simple trade between the tx sender and a miner, where the sender pays BTC to a miner and the miner processes the (perhaps extra large) transaction. But rather that the rest of the network ""must"" also bear the costs. 

Thus if blocksize were uncapped, the argument goes, miners would process big transactions that are profitable for them (because they receive the entire fee, which exceeds their own costs) but a net loss for the network as a whole (because the cost to the network exceeds the fee). Thus ""tx fees are not a market"" because there's a ""tragedy of the commons.""

One reservation I have is that it's not actually the case that other nodes must bear the cost. They have a choice whether to relay larger transactions and they can set their own blocksize limits. If it becomes unprofitable for the rest of the network to deal in larger blocks, the miners that do will find themselves isolated, will they not? 

More generally, for their to be a tragedy of the commons there needs to be a commons - that is, a rivalrous resource that everyone can consume and that no one can restrict the consumption of. 

For example an unowned lake around which is a ring of houses. If everyone can freely fish the lake, overfishing will destroy it. But the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum seems different: the network node resources seem less like the lake and more like the resources within the houses themselves, where if you allow your house space and tools to be used by others you get to use everyone else's (you get to participate in the HouseShare system). Critically, this does *not* make the housing spaces and tools a commons, because if one is too greedy in their use of other people's things they may simply find themselves cut off from the system by other homeowners.

Of course the foundation will be sitting on a lot of money to begin with.... but why do you say it is bad? It could be misspent, true; but it is not certain to be misspent merely because it is centralised. 

The fundraiser has been delayed over and over while the development continues, new people are being brought on board, research is being conducted. In funding ethereum at the fundraiser we will thus be voting on whether we like what they've been doing and trust them to continue that way.

So far, I like what the ethereum project is doing. I also trust that we will have plenty more information on their spending plans once the fundraiser is finally underway. And remember, if there is any group of people acutely sensitive to the problem of centralised control, it is these guys.


and finally, I think trying to perpetuate the extreme inequality of btc distribution as you suggest as an alternative (æthereum) is a bad idea. That just sounds like large btc holders wanting to have their cake and eat it too.

"Never realized that you could! At least for the burning of subcurrencies/ether. Not entirely sure if the economics of burning is sensible, afaik burn-over only makes sense if the intention is really to transfer activity. The transfer seems to be the wrong way :)

But you call it BtcEth, but how do you subsequently relate it to bitcoins?

One scenario: (edited for clarity) Both sides need clients on both bitcoin and ethereum.

* You(Y) want BTC from ether you buy BtcEths from the contract.(or rather, its just ethers that are locked up to ensure presence)
* Some person P wants ethers for BTC and requests a trade. (could be later or before)
* Software on Y's client notices this and gives indication that it is online.
* P chooses from online clients that want BTC, and sets up a bitcoin transaction dependent on H(S), and revealing H(S)
* Y(and possible) sets up ether released upon knowing S.(based on H(S)
* P releases the ether transactions towards him, revealing S. Then Y(and others) use S to release the transactions paying them BTC.

Really, though, it is all about communication here. P is really just looking for offerings, concensus is only needed for the 'upon-release' transactions.

Edit: Not sure, perhaps it *really* helps; i mean the BtcEths contract can provide a stick that people dont lie about wanting BTC. Still, i think maybe communication between clients knowing adresses like that needs to be made somewhat easy too?

"The problem with any discussion in the cryptocurrency space is the prevalence of Austrian-school terminology, and the general confusion as to what deflation and inflation mean.

Just to avoid confusion, let's use inflation/deflation to refer to price changes strictly, without talking about the quantity of money available.

So what does it mean to say that Ethereum (or Bitcoin) is deflationary? The argument goes something like this; the supply of money is increasing linearly (or sublinearly), but the demand for money is exponential, as more goods appear, and the number of people increase.  Therefore, over time, the value of money will increase, thus leading to deflation.

The problem with this argument is the claim about the growth of the supply of money.  This is only true with an incredibly restrictive definition of money supply; basically limited to M0.  Even there, M0 is no good since it includes ""guaranteed"" deposits (usually with a central bank).  So really, we're making the claim that the money supply is equivalent to the supply of specie.

The problem is that the actual amount of money circulating in an economy is a market phenomenon, because metrics of money supply have to take into account credit markets.  At the moment, neither Ethereum nor Bitcoin have even rudimentary credit markets, so this is not as much of a factor.

But if either coin is successful, credit markets will evolve -- people with money will seek to increase their money by purchasing cash-like instruments (demand deposits, savings accounts, bonds, stocks, real estate); which allows the actual specie to circulate, while simultaneously allowing them to ""keep"" the money based on the liquidity of the instruments, and earning interest on the money in the meantime.

So, in short, I don't buy the argument that either coin is deflationary.  At best we can say that it is long-term deflationary, but even there we need a ridiculous number of assumptions to make that claim.",0,t1_cgegzwo,t3_21l7rw,t3_21l7rw,False,,2,False,,1433112816,1396043050,andrewla,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cgegzwo,True,0

"The miners will enter into the market but with much less funds slowly over time. And the Investor could sell a few for a high price, the demand will be very high if too many people get locked out of the IPO. Its not only that extreme case, if 3 or 5 ""big players"" will buy in the IPO can be finished in 1 minute. I would hate to not be able to buy in because the servers can not handle so much requests and then the IPO is closed because the cap is reached.
But beside that I think for the future development that power concentration would be very bad. The ether funds of the founders are time-locked so they cannot influence the market, the miners will need much time to create funds and if supply is too low the price will skyrocket, driving more people into mining and makes investment in mining very high, so the price and mining cost will be in an equilibrium.

The goal isn't to use a decentralized identity to grant access to a centralized website. That only is going halfway.

Ex: I don't want to use WhatsApp(rely on centralized infrastructure), I want to message p2p(rely on my own or decentralized infrastructure).

If its possible using namecoin, great. My intuition is that its much easier to accomplish on ethereum, as contracts have access to the storage to other contracts. Thus, you can define an 'identity' as a network of modularly linked persona contracts(contracts only editable by one address) and services (also contracts).

Another thing.

If everythingis fee based why couldnt the founders always ""walmart"" the competition in every profitable sphere?

For example you do a roulette wheel casino contract with the least possibler margin covering the fees of the contract executing. But the founders can duplicate your contract and underbid you by operating at a loss for a while until theirs is the most widely known Casino name name and they clear the field (that's means you are gone or irrelevant). 

Then they raise their margins in the contract (slightly reduce payout) and rake it in.

They can do this on every single contract innovation anyone comes up with.

We know where some of the challenges and pressure points are but some are [unknown unknowns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_unknown). Bitcoin for example has yet to come under any sort of full network attack yet. 99.99% of messages sent on the Bitcoin network are well formed and correct.

Proof of stake is still being debated, some academics [think it is worthless](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2393940). There hasn't been enough real world simulation of proof of stake attacks to tell whether it is secure or not. The coming together of psychology, game theory and cryptography makes it very hard to analyse in a mathematical way. Nobody in my mind has yet proposed any implementable strategy which is better than proof of pointless work. 

Ethereum is heading into even more uncharted waters. It will require years of real world testing before it can be verified to be resistant to attacks.

Maidsafe uses some [clever ideas](http://maidsafe.net/maidsafe-network-platform-libraries) but David Irvine has had difficulty explaining them to a wider audience. I think it is important that we test as many different schemes and protocols and altcoins as possible. Quarkcoin for example may have some flaws but it is a valid altcoin which tests out new ideas.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

However, i cant help but wonder, in PoS, staking('mining') alternative blocks comes at no cost, there is another side to that aswel; you can have many chains... And afaics Slashers system of avoiding people pushing incorrect blocks would still work, excepting the time-interval thing.

And pure PoS systems have to deal with the time-interval issue somehow too, and if just one of the chains uses PoW, they can lockstep all the other chains with that, i reckon..

(Of course with PoW, multiple chains would divide work(hashing) power, and it would be easier to put the attack onto one chain. Rewarding the more difficult mining more would only change the tactic of the attacker towards trying to move around the difficulty until he ends up with the most work-power in a block.)

"Creating ethereum and a name registry creates the domain system. Build. No 'domain investors' needed there!

NameReg works, but it is not yet figured out yet what the 'final' form is. Almost certainly it will support sub-NameRegs that anyone can start, and all of those could essentially work arbitrarily. i.e. it could be a single organization using all the sub-entries, or a complete system of selling sub-name registries. There are *many* ways of doing it! Not all are 'just ownership of an entry that can be sold', for instance you can enforce that it will be sold if someone pays double, forcing the players to play for the value they perceive someone may come in and pay. Or you can have a 'dictator' or a little voting scheme about who gets domains.

But there needs to be a top name registry. Because of this freedom. I reckon the top name registry should prevent hoarding of names like 'google', 'reddit', 'eff', 'NSA', 'sex'.. There is no point in letting people 'invest' in those names.. That is just people grabbing the things, not doing useful work, and extorting the current owners. Probably it is better if the Ethereum DAO has some control. Not sure if we simply want to list a large amount of them.. Maybe give the Ethereum DAO voting rights to change the owner. There could be a time limit on it, i.e. for a year after getting a domain from the top namereg, the DAO can still change it.(there would be measures inside the DAO the guide the process, of course) The DAO may also be able remove this power from names.

Another solution is to have an entire list of domain names that are seizable. Probably this list wouldnt actually be on the blockchain, instead we'd use a [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) of wich the root checksum is on the blockchain somewhere, and we can use that to prove it is in the list if we want to seize a domain. 

I realize, well grabbing power over large swathes of the toplevel domain, its not optimal, maybe.. We should *not* have that power over *all* the domains, and if there is one we dont have power over, the person/DAO that holds it can subdomain any way he wants.

(i) High level of deduplication. We are in a unique situation where thousands of people's code is stored in a common database where we can choose the format, and we should take advantage of that. Ultimately, I want to erase the distinction between functions, code-blocks and libraries.
(ii) Simplicity. The fewer ops the better.
(iii) Optimization-friendliness.

The question is, what is the right tool for the job?

There are 4 main solutions to the problem:

1. Assembly-like language with jumps
2. Postscript-like language with concatenation and functions
3. Lisp-like language with functions and recursion
4. Some moderately simple language that actual humans code in, like Lua

Ethereum 0.0.1, as old-timers might recall, was purely (1). Then, on the advice of Andrew Miller, Paul Snow and others, I switched to stack-based, but still with jumps. Now, we are looking at something similar to (2). You might notice that ES2 is actually almost exactly like Postscript, except that we are using hashes-as-pointers as a possible alternative to including lists directly and we don't have arrays, dicts, variables or first-class functions. However, Gav Wood's criticism of (2) is that it's imposing a preference for a certain set of control structures (IFELSE, WHILE, function calling) by fiat, whereas a jump-based approach lets the compiler create whatever control structures it wants.

(3) is interesting and highly elegant, primarily because Lisp is designed to be extensible so it might be possible to use an existing Lisp interpreter (although that might also be problematic, since we do heavily rely on 20-32 byte strings and ints and all existing machines are 4-byte or 8-byte). I also like the Lisp approach from a philosophical standpoint, in that it has a very high level of simplicity by reducing everything to functions - an interesting parallel to the assembly approach of reducing everything to jumps. However, my main qualm with Lisp is that Lisp is fundamentally a functional language designed around immutable data structures, and Ethereum is fundamentally a state machine. 

(4) is a bad idea, since humans' coding preferences change. Sure, we can pick a language that people like coding in now. But 10 years down the line, people might invent some completely new paradigm, and we would end up with people writing compilers down to Lua - a much more shaky and untested field than compiling down to register-assembly, or stack, or even Lisp. 

Ultimately, I think the optimal ES design should be decided on based on what the actual applications are that people want to use. We have a person trying to implement a clearinghouse, as well as many other applications, and we'll see how the language can be tweaked to make such applications work better.",0,t1_cf77k0m,t3_1x0ebg,t3_1x0ebg,False,,7,False,Founder,1432254960,1391559453,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cf77k0m,True,0

"Um. From what you've written, it seems as though you're missing the point.

The issue isn't a fork of the *code*. If that were the issue, your argument would be right.

The issue is that people might set up a whole competing *block chain*, using essentially the *same* code. That's a completely different kind of ""fork"".

You could take a copy of the *exact* Ethereum code you guys produce, change a few parameters, and have it running on an alternate blockchain with no premine at all. They'd be creating a completely separate alternate currency, call it Ether-prime.

The things that makes one currency more attractive than another are other people to trade with, total volume of money you can move, prestige... and the share of the wealth that the prospective user can have. Code quality and features don't come into the question... especially if they're both using the same code.

The argument being made is that prospective users will see that they can get a bigger share of the wealth in Ether-prime than in Ether, because there's no premine in Ether-prime. At the beginning, neither Ether nor Ether-prime will necessarily have many users to trade with or much volume of money moved... so share of the wealth becomes a big motivator. The only things Ether will have over Ether-prime are prestige and good will, and those may not be enough to make people accept the premining.

If enough people choose Ether-prime over Ether in the beginning, Ether-prime becomes the *dominant* currency rather than an *alternate* currency. Which means that ""official"" Ether on the original block chain could have much, much less value than you anticipate.

Again, this could happen with NO modification to the code. There wouldn't really have to be a project. There would just have to be a nucleus of people who agree on a different set of parameters, early enough in the game that they can get enough mindshare to displace the ""official"" Ether.

Any proposed response to that should be aimed at making the Ether more attractive than Ether-prime for early adopters. So, for example, if you run a limited beta with selected ""loyal"" users, that means that as soon as you release the ""real"" system, new users will immediately have somebody to trade with in the Ether blockchain, whereas Ether-prime is left playing catchup. You use the exreme power of network effects to make your Ether more attractive than Ether-prime.

Now, even if you don't do that, you'll still have prestige on your side at launch... and that's a powerful force. On the other hand, it seems as though the only alternate currencies that succeed in growing with Bitcoin already established are currencies that people perceive as having fairer mining models. So you should know that you have a powerful counterfocrce against you.

And what you've written makes it sound like you don't even understand what you're being warned *might* happen.

"In Ethereum, there can be ""contracts"".  
They are sets of instructions that everyone can see, read and understand.

A user can ask miners (and everyone else who will verify the miners work) to perform these instructions on his behalf.

But, what happens if a user asks miners to perform a set of instructions that gets the miners stuck in a never-ending loop?

That's why ""gas"" exists:  
Every time some user asks for a contract to be run, he must also ""attach"" a given amount of money and state how many ""steps"" of work that money is going to cover (maximum amount of ""gas"" he's paying for).  
If a miner performs those instructions and correctly ""mines"" a block, one of two things can happen:

1. The steps performed were less than the maximum limit the user promised: the miner will keep enough money to cover the steps he actually performed (spent gas), and the rest goes back to the user (unspent gas).

Now either the payment processor of my boss needs to implement exactly the scrip that my multisig scheme uses or I have to accept the money with the trusty old single signature scheme and send it to myself with a new multisig script. Inbetween any kind of malware would be able to grab it and run. It is reatrdetly complicated that the sender needs to know and cooperate with how I'm planning to spend my money later on in bitcoin.

 [**Product differentiation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product%20differentiation): 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and [marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing), **product differentiation** (or simply differentiation) is the process of distinguishing a [product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business\)) or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular [target market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market). This involves differentiating it from [competitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition)' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by [Edward Chamberlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Chamberlin) in his 1933 Theory of Monopolistic Competition.

But, if you were not intending to tread on the territory of how meatspace might actually interact with the perfect mathematical crystals of interlocking ethereal contracts, then perhaps I am commenting on the wrong thread.  If by ""investment fund"" you mean some delegation of authority by owners of physical assets to a manager, and the redistribution of real returns from the holding, buying and selling of physical assets, then I think you need to consider the flesh and blood part of the equation.  For example, bringing gold into the ethereum investment universe at some point requires a warehouseman.  She hires guards with big guns to keep the assets safe.  And even though she may issue receipts for that gold in accounts of ethereal splendor, when those guards grow sleepy or are bought off, the value of those receipts will likely drop, suddenly and unhappily.  
Now, I do realize that it is possible to fantasize about a world in which no gold can leave or enter the warehouse without a smart contract insisting on a full accounting, and the weighing machinery itself is protected from false measure by another smart contract tied to a measure judged honest by the consensus of a distributed crowd, etc., etc..  I myself am more interested in what ethereum might be able to do within the sadly flawed world I wake up in each morning.  In this world, delegating portfolio trading authority to Alice IS trusting Alice, and this is a feature of that particular relationship, not a flaw.  I hope other, less rewarding, delegations in day-to-day life can be contracted away.  The ultimate questions are not ""how do we get rid of all trust relationships"" but ""how do we best (most efficiently) move the trust to the activities that are most productive, and make those trusted activities auditable.

"I don't think an alternative blockchain is as likely as people here seem to think, as long as the pre-mine isn't insanely huge. For both initial investors and early miners, the potential returns that would come from making ethereum take off as quickly as possible completely dwarf the relative difference between their returns on a pre-mined or non-pre-mined blockchain.

Have a look at this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/20c2sm/the_economist_hidden_flipside_how_the/
The Economist (circulation: ~1.5 Million) just mentioned Ethereum in a positive article about Bitcoin, saying this about Ethereum: ""The most ambitious project is Ethereum: it will launch a new blockchain, similar but unrelated to Bitcoin, with a programming language to encode financial instruments and other contracts."". Ethereum is a trademark and a domain owned by the current devs (I hope), and that means that new adopters will flop to ethereum.org and start out with the official clients. creating alternate blockchains is creating a huge barrier to understanding and entry which will slow down the growth of the ecosystem, and the ecosystem is all that can make Ether valuable.

"&gt; Nobody, including Satoshi had an advantage at any time during the project's history.

Absolutely false IMO. Satoshi had the advantage that he knew about Bitcoin from day 1, and he posted the information on a specific set of forums that he chose and not on other forums. 99.9999%+ of the world's population had no chance whatsoever to do anything with Bitcoin simply because they didn't know about it before 25% of all currency units that will ever exist were released. Meanwhile, in Ethereum, I specifically forced the project to have an infinitely growing currency supply so there is no such thing as ""25% of all currency units that will ever exist"" in the first place.

I think that making distribution models that are ""technically fair"" is a futile task; the best approach is to look at how we can create a distribution model that is as widely dispersed as possible, and that necessarily involves delivering currency units to multiple constituencies. If you have hardware, you can mine, if you have money, you can buy, and if you have talent you can participate in development.

"As Vitalik indicated, we have no idea where the 29.4% number came from.  Any speculations at this point are unfounded.  We are still working out budgets and other financial issues and have not finalized any numbers. 

We are acutely aware of the community sentiment regarding a possible pre-mine.  We are also weighing the value of having ETH to pay salaries which keeps our individual and corporate interests more completely aligned with those of Genesis Sale ETH buyers.  Whether there is a pre-mine or not, we will need to have lots of ETH on day one to pay out obligations (e.g. salaries to developers), to help fund third parties who are developing DApps on Ethereum, and possibly to help stabilize the currency in the early days.  We are looking at ways to reduce the pre-mine significantly and possibly even eliminate it.  If we do end up eliminating it or having a very small pre-mine, we will have to buy ETH in the market which creates other issues.

We certainly don't want the role of a central bank, but in the early days of bootstrapping the system, it may be prudent to ensure that the currency is stable while new businesses on the system are making their services available and figuring out the implementational details of their business models.  Some third parties have already indicated that they are interested in setting up trade desks to stabilize any currency fluctuations (and be paid for taking risks in these activities).  Such groups will likely assist ETH to remain in a non-volatile trading band and they will likely have other businesses that depend on an ETH price that is not excessively volatile.  In the event that there is not enough ETH liquidity at certain times and exchange rates rise rapidly, we may want to have a pool of readily available ETH that we can draw from to reduce drastic upward volatility and enable businesses on the system to operate economically while the economy grows and gains stability. Bootstrapping an economy will be an interesting endeavor.  We expect businesses on the system to figure things out, bottom up, grass roots.  But one thing they don't need to contend with is an excessively volatile ETH price, so we may step in on occasion to dampen large swings.  This is all still under discussion and rest assured that we will default to fully free market dynamics as soon as possible.

"I personally respect Invictus/Mastercoin and their Devs. Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact, Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.

I love competition, but it feels like it is too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used compared to this premine bs was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you buid value in our ecosystem, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have). Whereas the ""Silicon Valley"" model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"", utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market (aka non-corrupt) approach. Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ALL but the ""founders"", with founders being only the big names in the BTC industry whose reps they want to use for ""viral marketing"" and a group of a few tightly-knit insiders--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the ""innovation"" part.

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth. Instead of telling people on a mic how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition. Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it"" I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward. Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

We don't need a Crypto-Microsoft. In fact, we don't need a crypto-Google. We need many competitors and honest competition...otherwise we probably wont like what happens 15-20 years down the road.

Just MHO, take it or leave it, but it is here with the sole intent of providing a non-biased look at things in this space. I like MasterCoin (dont own them unfortunately), wish I trusted Hoskinson and the other team members who fail to acknowledge those from whom they wish to win the Championship Belt so I could feel good about Ether, and I own a small amount of PTS/AGS. Longterm holder because I love the Devs, community and await the first Decentralized Bank in Keyhotee Free Space...

"Is that a valid comparison?

A cheap iPhone clone is just that....a cheap clone. Ever seen one? They are not the same thing at all. A clone of Ethereum could be a line for line copy....contracts would transfer over, everything could transfer over. You wouldn't be losing anything in the process except for the main developer work on the code....but then you just merge that int when they make updates on the ""real"" base.

Satoshi also isn't the best comparison. Bitcoin from 2009 to 2011 was something that people didn't know would succeed. Huge stashes of coins were just thrown away because people considered them worthless, no one at the time would have faulted Satoshi for anyone else for accumulating large amounts of what was essentially dirt.

"Accessing just the current hash would achieve what you say.(edit: afaict it is best to choose as random seed something that is result of each mining attempt, am i wrong? in that view..) There is no 'arms race' as the computing power for running the contracts has to be in range of the full nodes, and this is easily in range for any the miners interested in an attack like this.

Miners can still just win a block, and then not send it on the network if it doesnt suit their (paying clients)bets. Worse, they can monitor the network and only send winning blocks if they are , they then still have a shot at the block reward.

Tried to look at it in depth [here](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/630/contracts-affecting-miner-behavior), tbh i dont think it is a particularly successful analysis.

* For repeated N bets the standard deviation is σ≈sqrt(N)⋅p⋅(1-p) i.e. it keeps going up even for many small bets, so many small bets could add up to incentive to miner collusion.

* I dont really know how miners and betters come together to create their devious schemes. Certainly when there is a single big player and big miner you should be worried. How the big player pays out to third parties might also be important. (if small miners can use that) The size of income that the colluder can rake in depends on who he can create trustful/trustless relations with.

* The commitment scheme can completely protect parties, if failing to provide the random value committed to implies losing accordingly. That approach can be inconvenient.

* Just realized that a *single* contract succeeding at getting non-influencable, non-predictable result would solve the problem for everyone.

* Say block reward is **B** *plain* dropping can be done when **&lt;w&gt; &gt; B + h**, where **h** is the current bet winnings and **&lt;w&gt;** the expected ones.

* Dropping where you watch the network and have a probability **p** to get in your block if you enter it at the last minute, seeing a competitor that implies winnings **c**, you allow the competitor when **c &gt; B+h**, and you try to inject the one you had otherwise, then expectation of earnings **&lt;e&gt; = p(B+h) + c(1-p)**

  But the threshhold for trying is also lowered. 
* Should figure out increase of earnings to miners? Really that depends, if we can figure out how to get that single contract, the analysis would be moot.

Have a look at this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/20c2sm/the_economist_hidden_flipside_how_the/
The Economist (circulation: ~1.5 Million) just mentioned Ethereum in a positive article about Bitcoin, saying this about Ethereum: ""The most ambitious project is Ethereum: it will launch a new blockchain, similar but unrelated to Bitcoin, with a programming language to encode financial instruments and other contracts."". Ethereum is a trademark and a domain owned by the current devs (I hope), and that means that new adopters will flop to ethereum.org and start out with the official clients. creating alternate blockchains is creating a huge barrier to understanding and entry which will slow down the growth of the ecosystem, and the ecosystem is all that can make Ether valuable.

No-one will want to build anything on top of Ethereum if there is contention about which is the legitimate blockchain, and the name ""Ethereum"" with its associated website and people already has significant fame, which ensures that the original devs have a pretty big foot in the door.",0,t1_cg319wf,t3_20avak,t1_cg1p188,False,,2,False,,1432807745,1394858543,hedgepigdaniel,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cg319wf,True,0

"I think it would be possible to implement a chess (or checkers) game as a contract where the contract is initiated with the keys for two players, the moves are submitted as transaction, and the winner is verified by the ethereum system. The winner could also be paid a prize via the contract. Still might be considered gambling though although it isn't a game of chance.

I think ""judging"" could also be implemented as an Ethereum contract, like if you have a contest it could be initiated with the public keys of the judges and the contestants, and the judges could submit via transactions and the contract could award itself to the winner.

I think an Ethereum contract could be used to send encrypted communication, it could also used to hold an election, the way American idol uses text message votes, both of which aren't ""games"" but could be done in the context of a game.

I think the most interesting possibility is a game that is fully implemented as an Ethereum contract, or as a series of interlocking contracts. If you have a ""game server"" that holds the world-state of the game, then you can use that as a trusted broker and you don't really need the Ethereum network. Whereas a game that is purely implemented as contracts is totally self contained, and doesn't rely on trust, you can inspect the contract before you play. The only hiccup I see at first blush is that to be Denial Of Service resistant the game would require players to ""pay"" for their moves when they submit them via contract. Once such a game is designed, it would be possible to make a more attractive game client that you run on your system to play the game.

"Essentially, yes, but the problem is that the number of domains is *enormous*, and we may not want to stuff all that into ethereum. The scalability problem isnt solved yet.

So the Merkle tree structure allows you to put a single checksum in there that allows you prove some entry is in a large data set. But the contract itself cant actually do it. Say you buy `google.com` on our system.. Well, the system cannot stop you, but if we get a message from google that it isnt them, we can prove to the contract that google is in the list of domains. But ones not in the domains like  `not_a_domain.com` we cannot because it isnt in the list.

Of course the list would a snapshot of the domains at some time and be public. There would be an interface to check, probably also used when you are buying.

Tl;dr a technical solution to not loading every domain name on the blockchain requires that domains can be taken away retroactively.

The convoluted part is *not* the fact that we're using a blockchain-based tech to store identities. It all sounds well and good. In fact, for what's available now, OneName is perfect.

It gets convoluted when you want your services to interact with the identity info or enforce rules around that identity. You then have to query the name-chain for the info you need, and insert that data into a transaction on another chain. Enforcing service rules based on identity info means you practically need that info stored in whichever chain you are using. Thats why you have Twister using its own name system, instead of just using OneName/Namecoin.

This isn't necessarily an issue at the moment, since there isn't even much of a coherent ecosystem of decentralized services yet. However, once more services are layered on ethereum, I think it will start to make more sense to transfer identities over there.

There are many advantages to doing ETH forwards:

1) traders and investors may have access to tradable assets prior to, during and after any fundraiser and speculate on ETH and vicariously the Ethereum project.

2) we provide a simple way to obtain and track ETH assets while Ethereum's methodology of distribution will be more complex and non liquid with no exchange at the beginning.

"&gt;You dwell *as* an example in your favor. :-p

I don't understand this, sorry! 

You understand bitcoin better than I, and probably Ethereum too. The complexity I was feeling uncomfortable with was not the scripting - that can, *I hope*, only screw up an application. 

My concern was intuitive, and about flaws in the foundation of Ethereum, such as in what to use for various parameters, and how seemingly innocuous choices about these could have very unexpected effects. I'm thinking chaos theory here, and I think it is naive to expect order and predictability in what will become a very large and complex system. 

Perhaps bitcoin is not that much simpler. I haven't studied the code, or the scripting language. A brief look at that in Ethereum is what made me concerned. 

Creating multiple independent implementations, and other validation techniques are admirable, but there are no methods of conventional software development that can eliminate vulnerabilities of the kind I'm suggesting, in a conventional software system. 

In my scenario, all you can do is make the *system* as a *whole,* robust when things go wrong in unanticipated ways. Biological systems: DNA/evolutionary genetics, cells, organs, organisms, families, communities, ecosystems, GAIA, etc are examples of how to do this. 

You can throw a massive asteroid at GAIA, and she will probably survive. Take out large numbers of humans, or throw a brand new pandemic disease at humanity, and our species would survive, with or without a neocortex and millennia of medical cultural knowledge. Hence my interest in MaidSafe.

You made the point that evolution is slow, but this is not necessarily the case. In the context of finding highly optimised solutions, to very large complex problems, evolution is very efficient, very many times more efficient than random search. Nature is highly optimised for speed as well as resilience, so if the domain calls for this kind of solution, an evolutionary system may well be fast as well as robust. It depends on the complexity of the space being explored. 

However, it may not need to be evolutionary to be resilient, as one could design for a stable environment with known boundary conditions, and create a stable solution modelled on a biologically system for a similar domain. The design process may or may not use an evolution engine, depending on the complexity of the design space.

"I agree 'cryptocontract' or 'self-enforcing contracts' would be better words. Cryptocontracts by themselves cant send anyone to jail, of course, and the worst that your wallet itself can do is reach zero. Lack of resources for your own sustainance or other people have to do it.

Also there are a lot of potential scripts that are good out there. Including giving more assurances. For instance you could have a script with your money, but you can only send from it at some set rate. It could have a list of N trusted people, M from which together to change the address. That is one mechanism to stop major accidental mistakes sending money. 

People of course have to be careful what contracts/scripts to use Afaik people can basically only end up with bad contracts if they're stupid(or stupid to act from badly informed information) or too limited in options. Both can happen in the real world already, and rarely does the 'flex' in non-factum contracts actually help anyone. Quite the opposite, from what i hear. Significant rights reductions for loans that happen to be owned by the state, in the Netherlands, they totally changed the rules for retirement funds, and 'mortage' means 'house with loan' here. You cant default and leave the house, you'd keep the remaining debt, on the plus side. (Goddammit my mother said with a regular mortage, if you leave the house at the last moment, everything paid on the house is gone, but that is actually a better situation.. I mean in the former it is all gone and you still have to pay some more..) And the bailouts are also examples where the rules bend, also to our detriment.

I reckon if the rules are bendable they'll usually bend towards those in power. There will be cases where this probably isnt enough. Crypto contracts need to pick their fights.

"The problem with any discussion in the cryptocurrency space is the prevalence of Austrian-school terminology, and the general confusion as to what deflation and inflation mean.

Just to avoid confusion, let's use inflation/deflation to refer to price changes strictly, without talking about the quantity of money available.

So what does it mean to say that Ethereum (or Bitcoin) is deflationary? The argument goes something like this; the supply of money is increasing linearly (or sublinearly), but the demand for money is exponential, as more goods appear, and the number of people increase.  Therefore, over time, the value of money will increase, thus leading to deflation.

The problem with this argument is the claim about the growth of the supply of money.  This is only true with an incredibly restrictive definition of money supply; basically limited to M0.  Even there, M0 is no good since it includes ""guaranteed"" deposits (usually with a central bank).  So really, we're making the claim that the money supply is equivalent to the supply of specie.

The problem is that the actual amount of money circulating in an economy is a market phenomenon, because metrics of money supply have to take into account credit markets.  At the moment, neither Ethereum nor Bitcoin have even rudimentary credit markets, so this is not as much of a factor.

But if either coin is successful, credit markets will evolve -- people with money will seek to increase their money by purchasing cash-like instruments (demand deposits, savings accounts, bonds, stocks, real estate); which allows the actual specie to circulate, while simultaneously allowing them to ""keep"" the money based on the liquidity of the instruments, and earning interest on the money in the meantime.

So, in short, I don't buy the argument that either coin is deflationary.  At best we can say that it is long-term deflationary, but even there we need a ridiculous number of assumptions to make that claim.",0,t1_cgegzwo,t3_21l7rw,t3_21l7rw,False,,2,False,,1433112816,1396043050,andrewla,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cgegzwo,True,0

To be honest from any release I have seen since bitcoin/litecoin they seem to be very transparent and affording the entire world the singular opportunity to be part of a revolution at its beginning. As far as a way to make the fundraiser fair I would simply release the cap, right now you (ethereum) may not have a plan for $24 million, $100 million, or $1 billion but you will find a responsible way to invest and spend it for the good of ethereum. I think a fair way to do this might be to take all the money that is given to you issue the ether currency as planned using the same ratio and so forth and simply place any ""money we don't know what to do with"" into a smart financial deposit of some kind earning interest and return some of that interest to everyone who has supported you in ether to each individual in proportion to the original amount they donated.

"&gt; The fact is that the modern world is very different from that past 6000 years in two key ways: increased interdependence between geographic regions, and increased dependence on uncapturable capital (social networks). IMO, both of these together make international warfare essentially nonviable. Now more non-intrusive mechanisms like cyberwarfare, product sabotage and financial warfare, those I can see continuing to play out; in fact, one could argue that many countries are currently engaging in financial warfare against each other right now.

It's nice to hear your views on wider social implications, Vitalik, thanks for taking the time. But this above is overly optimistic, and basic globalisation discourse at that, you must admit: globalisation or distributed power-production networks have long proven themselves to be as much if not more of an exacerbater of transnational hegemonies (military, financial, legal, labour, ...) than they are a force for radical emancipation. All powerful financial-governmental institutions openly subvert their own legal taxation frameworks to off-shore their profits. All belligerant nation-states unsubtly wage their wars assymetrically via unending series of so-called humanitarian interventions. All multi-national corporations worthy of their name exploit cheap, developing nation labour costs. In this sense hegemonic power has been leading and innovating the decentralisation game for decades: far from ""nonviable"" it's vital to its own continuation, as means of re-producing itself. It's imperative not to be naive on how this works.

That said, I am cautiously optimistic about projects like Ethereum as it potentially lowers the entry requirements for autonomous contract production. Relatively small organisations may be enabled to compete with hegemonic institutions at their own game. But what's essential for this to be genuinely emancipatory is for such contract production frameworks to be wedded to non-reactionary political programs, otherwise it will inevitably lapse into exploitative discourse yet again -- only at a microeconomic scale.

"Actually in the grand web 3.0 scheme, I'm not sure that tracking the cosign accounts in a contract (ie in the blockchain) is the right way to do it. I think that this should be a wallet feature implemented with some kind of ""wallet storage"" not shared with the world (similar to the HTML5 localStorage). The user should also be able to sync his ""wallet storage"" content on whatever device he use. So for now a contract storage would works, but eventually I think that this is not the right place for this kind of data.

Similarly I think that the transaction should be created directly by the ethereum client (via a Ðapp UI) and not by a ""deployment contract"". I can create whatever contract I want, and in this case I see no reason to require a worldwide blockchain consensus about the creation step itself.

About the merging of vote I agree that a separate vote counter would be a valid solution (and optionally a rejection counter). But as the blockchain is a very expensive storage I feel that the data shouldn't be redundant. My idea was that if voter A and D said `yes`, and voters B, C and E hasn't voted yet we could encode that state as `10010`. Then if voter B says `yes` we simply use the bitwise OR `|= 01000` so the new state will be `11010`. But 1/ counting the `1` would require some kind of recursive functions, and 2/ I don't know how to implement the reject operation (do we need it?).

"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it""  I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.  

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward.  Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

We don't need a Crypto-Microsoft. In fact, we don't need a crypto-Google. We need many competitors and honest competition...otherwise we probably wont like what happens 15-20 years down the road.

Just MHO, take it or leave it, but it is here with the sole intent of providing a non-biased look at things in this space.  I like MasterCoin (dont own them unfortunately), wish I trusted Hoskinson and the other team members who fail to acknowledge those from whom they wish to win the Championship Belt so I could feel good about Ether, and I own a small amount of PTS/AGS.  Longterm holder because I love the Devs, community and await the first Decentralized Bank in Keyhotee Free Space...

"No and I consider it to be a closed matter. Dan and I are very different businessmen with both different vision and philosophy. It's better for the ecosystem that we are running separate ventures. I haven't had any involvement or equity in I3 since mid-October- prior to the launch of protoshares nor any involvement in Angelshares or other product launches. 

When I was the CEO, the business plan and the fiduciary obligations of the company were very different and more traditionally structured like a Silicon Valley startup. We had a single investor from China and all shares were owned by employees or associates of the company. I watched the mastercoin fundraiser and was deeply concerned with the lack of clarity about its status as a security in the United States hence I didn't want to embrace a swap style funding mechanism without first having significant legal due diligence and in a host jurisdiction that had more approachable regulators. 

Protoshares was originally intended to be only a market pricing mechanism established by third parties for the overall value of I3 and its promises moving into a series A. In essence, we would have had a number vetted by the traders on the exchanges for what I3 was worth providing a negotiating window for some interested valley VCs. 

At the end of the day, I believed that the primary product wasn't Bitshares but rather Keyhotee and its user base. Bitcoin is a fragmented ecosystem with terrible UX/UI, limited consumer appeal, and almost no emphasis on teaching best practices to protect consumer funds and privacy. Keyhotee was intended to fix these issues by starting as a curated chrome browser extension using an HD Wallet + PGP key generated from the same seed and having tight integration with webmail clients like gmail. One could move to a full featured desktop client via node.js and the mobile space via phonegap. Most importantly, you have a product in front of consumers in a few weeks and they are helping you make it better. That’s called building an ecosystem.  

Bitshares would have been a class of next generation specialized blockchains designed to enable decentralized exchange of any digitized asset- ironically this approach could have worked very well with sidechains. The associated DAC framework I felt was premature, underdeveloped, and also required the more generalized, turing complete framework that Buterin later developed for Ethereum. I don't see how one can claim perfect clarity for how to build autonomous sustainable businesses and then promise specific profits (+5%). When combined with a fundraiser, it seems naïve at best and criminal at worst.      
Honestly, my primary interest in the original Bitshares was the idea of P2P price discovery for cryptocurrencies. Combining this notion with better versions of localbitcoins, one wouldn’t need exchanges for small scale currency swaps allowing mini-satoshi squares to functionally become the ATMS of the developing world. I care very deeply about microfinance and onboarding the unbanked.  

That said, Ethereum does not view itself as a competitor to I3 or its affiliates. We seek to build a comprehensive, open sourced ecosystem that is accessible to all and interoperable with as many standards as possible. The goal here has always been unity and innovation. Focusing on petty personal feuds benefits no one and comes at the expense of time and mental energy.

"1. A lot of people have the mistaken impression that because Ethereum allows for ""computation"" it is necessarily going to be much slower than Bitcoin, which just does ""verification"". This is completely false. Fees will be sufficiently high that no one will actually attempt to implement any algorithms more complicated than cryptographic verification and basic business logic inside of Ethereum code, so we expect Ethereum contract-based transactions will only be slightly more expensive to process than in Bitcoin. In fact, space-wise Ethereum is more efficient than Bitcoin because unlike Bitcoin, where each account needs to store many separate unspent transaction outputs, in Ethereum each account needs to store only 100 bytes no matter how many transactions it has; hence, the efficiency of the two systems should be comparable.

2. PoW right now. We're looking at useful-PoW and PoS heavily though. The biggest problem with POS that I'm seeing is the long-range-attack problem (basically, start a chain from 10k blocks back, and ""mine"" it with some small percentage of all coins until it's a billion times longer than the original, and then convince new users that that is the legitimate chain). We are looking into it heavily. Realistically, one likely alternative is that ETH1.0 will be pretty boring with some relatively good Turing-complete memory-hard PoW, and ETH2.0 will bring the real innovation in.

3. We're working together quite a lot in Switzerland. The general idea is that Ethereum is decentralized, while OT is a server-based system (though with federation and auditing protocols), so Ethereum's advantage is that it is more trust-free and zero-infrastructure, whereas OT has lower transaction costs, higher privacy and confirmation time. Thus, we expect OT servers to plug into the Ethereum blockchain via contracts, allowing specialized applications like Chaumian anonymization and HFT to happen on the server while more ordinary transactions are done on the blockchain.

Ethereum is just a platform on which to build distributed applications.  You may as well be asking why would the layman ever use a computer because you have to be an expert to understand the microarchitecture of the CPU.  

&gt; Is ether destroyed?

I thought I read that this is being considered.  Anyway, this is matter of balancing the incentives of miners, users, early adopters, late adopters, and investors.  It is a tricky problem to get right, but it doesn't really matter too much in terms of technology.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

I'm not sure about that. There's a lot of idiots making altcoins right now, and you still have smart devs like Sunny King putting together things like Primecoin, Peercoin, Vertcoin, etc.

Bitcoin was able to avoid competitors being an issue because for the first 2-3 years there wasn't an immediate real competitor, and it was able to harness the network effect, to the point where even today where other alts have better features, it can maintain its status.

I had a nutty idea, send part of transaction fees to funders. Makes funders less sensitive to both in- and deflation. But it is nutty, really i dont know the economics well either.

Bounties for 'issuance'(effectively, but locked in the contract since the start of ethereum) does have a nice property that the more ethers are worth, the more incentive to forfill the bounty, so if the price goes up, bounties get forfilled, putting more ether in circulation.

"No and I consider it to be a closed matter. Dan and I are very different businessmen with both different vision and philosophy. It's better for the ecosystem that we are running separate ventures. I haven't had any involvement or equity in I3 since mid-October- prior to the launch of protoshares nor any involvement in Angelshares or other product launches. 

When I was the CEO, the business plan and the fiduciary obligations of the company were very different and more traditionally structured like a Silicon Valley startup. We had a single investor from China and all shares were owned by employees or associates of the company. I watched the mastercoin fundraiser and was deeply concerned with the lack of clarity about its status as a security in the United States hence I didn't want to embrace a swap style funding mechanism without first having significant legal due diligence and in a host jurisdiction that had more approachable regulators. 

Protoshares was originally intended to be only a market pricing mechanism established by third parties for the overall value of I3 and its promises moving into a series A. In essence, we would have had a number vetted by the traders on the exchanges for what I3 was worth providing a negotiating window for some interested valley VCs. 

At the end of the day, I believed that the primary product wasn't Bitshares but rather Keyhotee and its user base. Bitcoin is a fragmented ecosystem with terrible UX/UI, limited consumer appeal, and almost no emphasis on teaching best practices to protect consumer funds and privacy. Keyhotee was intended to fix these issues by starting as a curated chrome browser extension using an HD Wallet + PGP key generated from the same seed and having tight integration with webmail clients like gmail. One could move to a full featured desktop client via node.js and the mobile space via phonegap. Most importantly, you have a product in front of consumers in a few weeks and they are helping you make it better. That’s called building an ecosystem.  

Bitshares would have been a class of next generation specialized blockchains designed to enable decentralized exchange of any digitized asset- ironically this approach could have worked very well with sidechains. The associated DAC framework I felt was premature, underdeveloped, and also required the more generalized, turing complete framework that Buterin later developed for Ethereum. I don't see how one can claim perfect clarity for how to build autonomous sustainable businesses and then promise specific profits (+5%). When combined with a fundraiser, it seems naïve at best and criminal at worst.      
Honestly, my primary interest in the original Bitshares was the idea of P2P price discovery for cryptocurrencies. Combining this notion with better versions of localbitcoins, one wouldn’t need exchanges for small scale currency swaps allowing mini-satoshi squares to functionally become the ATMS of the developing world. I care very deeply about microfinance and onboarding the unbanked.  

That said, Ethereum does not view itself as a competitor to I3 or its affiliates. We seek to build a comprehensive, open sourced ecosystem that is accessible to all and interoperable with as many standards as possible. The goal here has always been unity and innovation. Focusing on petty personal feuds benefits no one and comes at the expense of time and mental energy.

&gt;**Ethernet** /ˈiːθərnɛt/ is a family of [computer networking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) technologies for [local area networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) (LANs). Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 and standardized in 1983 as [IEEE 802.3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3).  Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as [token ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring), [FDDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface), and [ARCNET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCNET).

&gt;The [Ethernet standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ethernet_standards) comprise several wiring and signaling variants of the [OSI physical layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer) in use with Ethernet. The original [10BASE5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5) Ethernet used [coaxial cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable) as a [shared medium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_medium). Later the coaxial cables were replaced with [twisted pair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair) and [fiber optic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber) links in conjunction with [hubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub) or [switches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_switch). Data rates were periodically increased from the original 10 [megabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabits) per second to 100 [gigabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabits) per second.

&gt;Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called [frames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking\)). Each frame contains source and destination addresses and error-checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted. As per the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) Ethernet provides services up to and including the [data link layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer).

"My issue with the pre-mine is that it creates the same fundamental conflict of interest that the entire crypto community is currently suffering from.  The incentive for currency holders becomes currency appreciation, which is not in the best interests of the currency itself, and is actually terrible for commerce.

An ideal currency maintains a steady value that remains very slightly inflationary (keeping pace with economic growth and de-incentivize hoarding).  Everyone trying to get rich off of the currency appreciation is exactly why all these pump/dump Altcoins are coming online, and failing.

If Ethereum wants to be *different* - wants to be *better*, then this tiresome pump/dump framework cannot be the model for it.  **Instead**, long term **price-insensitive rewards** need to be given (think of the long game).   We should give investors a return of Ether like a fixed income contract that pays well into the future, but instead of a fixed amount, they get a percentage of transaction fees for X blocks. 

So Mr Investo, for example, pays 1 BTC, and gets 0.01% of all tx fees for the next ten years.  This decouples the price sensitivity to the currency - allowing us to keep the price low (ie healthy for the economy) to remove the conflict of interest and allow proper inflation to occur without risk to the initial investors.

&gt;

&gt;**Gresham's law** is an economic principle that states: ""When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation."" It is commonly stated as: ""Bad money drives out good"".

&gt;This law applies specifically when there are two forms of commodity money in circulation which are required by legal-tender laws to be accepted as having similar face values for economic transactions. The artificially overvalued money tends to drive an artificially undervalued money out of circulation and is a consequence of price control.

&gt;The law was named in 1858 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been stated earlier by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the **Copernicus Law**. It was als ...

"Let's say they raise 1 thousand bitcoins in the ""IPO"". That means they'll give 1 million ethers to the backers and create 300 thousand for the Ethereum Foundation and release the Genesis block and kickstart the protocol. They protocol will be hardwire to create 400 thousand ethers by year, every year.

So before any mining, there's 1.3 million ethers around. The foundation owns therefore 23% of all ether. After a year of mining, the miners will have added another 400k, getting the total to 1.7 million ethers. The foundation's original 300k now represent 17% of the total. The amount held by the backers and foundation stays the same, but it becomes proportionally smaller every year.

Does this means that the total supply will grow indefinitely? Yes and no. Theoretically yes, at a constant rate which will represent a smaller and smaller % of the total.  But in practice some coins are always lost, going in hard drives in dumpsters, burned paper wallets, forgotten keys and more specifically to Ether, badly coded contracts and unexpected conditions that might lock coins forever. Let's say that every year, 1% of all ether is lost in those situations. This means that after 100 years, when there will be 40 million ethers in the network, 400 thousand of those will be lost in average, and 400k will be created by miners, so an equilibrium will have been reached and the supply will be constant.

"Every computational step done on Ethereum, including sending transactions will require tiny payments, so the best analogy in my opinion is that ether is the fuel that powers the execution of distributed applications on the Ethereum platform.

Trading back-and-forth between bitcoin and ether should be quick and easy.  We are working to have exchanges list ether, ATMs sell ether and are also working on methods of having bidirectional ether to bitcoin gateways (much like a sidechain). Ethereum has very different design goals from Bitcoin and we expect both to grow in tandem.

Using bitcoin as the fundamental token on our implementation or on any clone of Ethereum would be problematic.  Our issuance model for ether and security model for the network are intertwined.  We need a large number of miners to operate and secure the network with transaction processing and proof of work.  And we need to incentivize them to do so.  We can't incentivize them with bitcoin in perpetuity.  It would be expensive for us to buy that much bitcoin (not to mention foolish).  We need a token, intrinsic to the network, that miners will perceive as valuable.  Therefore this should be the same token that undergirds all commerce and computation on the platform.  Network demand for ether combined with network security and processing as the main source of ether sets up a positive feedback loop which grows the ecosystem.

"From my perspective, any new technical solution seeking to assist in developing countries needs to address actual (not perceived) problems with accessible solutions. While technical solutions to problems may assist in addressing those problems, they need to be humble enough to understand why and how to market themselves. For example, it is often cited that Africa has leapfrogged legacy infrastructure requirements in land based telecommunications. This is, more or less true, but it is likely a factor of corporate incentives to provide services to predominantly oral societies that has driven this rather than any particular love of a Nokia 6100. It also has some disadvantages because reliable broadband into homes, even in a town like Nairobi, still requires land based infrastructure and providing any level of comprehensive solutions, like APIs for mobile money systems, is exceedingly complicated because the IP is owned by corporations who have no interest in adopting standards. 

How does this apply to the Ethereum project? From my perspective, Ethereum projects which seek to provide solutions in developing countries will need to address a number of factors. First, while there may not be as much legacy legal infrastructure, as with legacy landlines, these legacy systems can have advantages. That said they can be easily corrupted. Ethereum can only address one of the two challenges which legal system users in the real world face. Ethereum will allow users to avoid debates upon interpretation of agreements (these mean that). However, the other major reason legal disputes in the transactional space occur is because there is a dispute over whether a particular event in the real world occurred or not. Ethereum, as a block chain technology, cannot address these. It can provide a framework to begin working towards a contracting methodology of trust reduced proof of real world events, but that is about the best it can achieve in the medium term. 

My point is that technological solutions, even the most elegant ones, do come at a cost and are never perfect. 

What Ethereum could provide users with, though, is certainty with respect to how transactions will operate and how disputes over whether a real world event occurred will be resolved. This is a game changer, but it applies to developing countries no more nor less than anywhere else. Many developing countries may have less developed formal rule of law systems, but they still have rule frameworks in which commercial transactions operate which can be just as sophisticated as legal rules passed by a parliament. So, in my opinion, the competition with other rule frameworks is not *necessarily* lower but it is slightly different. 

Second, people often assume that citizens of developing countries are somehow more willing to embrace change to existing ways and means, but as development economists have more or less shown, the opposite is actually true. People closer to the poverty line have a stronger resistance to change than those in the middle class. To succeed in developing countries, Ethereum projects will likely need to abstract away the brilliant technology behind what is happening and just provide things that work. 

Lastly, any Ethereum project looking to succeed needs to market themselves well. Simply building great stuff is not enough. But marketing well requires time, knowledge, and presence. So time will tell what happens. 

For my part, I remain very optimistic about the possibilities Ethereum will provide, but for me those possibilities remain more in the area of automating complex tasks than in replacing rule frameworks... at least in the short and medium term.",0,t1_ch6ql48,t3_24b3aa,t3_24b3aa,False,,2,False,,1433602166,1398933712,compleatang,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,ch6ql48,True,0

Take Bitcoin for example: 5% of 21 million bitcoins is currently valued at half a billion dollars. Would that not be enough for the developers? Imagine if bitcoin was 30% premined at 6 million coins. I think it could have potentially damanged bitcoin and its growth.

And yet for all of Bitcoin's popularity, the scalability limits are not really an issue yet.

"I don't want to discourage longterm thinking about the DAOogles of the future, but as we are not there just yet, I was hoping to keep one foot on the ground for a moment.  There is great value in thinking about and writing Ethereum contracts that make use of the turing completeness and the crypto primitives to perform complex operations under the watchful gaze of the blockchain.  Still, I think you wave your hands a bit carelessly when you state:
""we no longer care if Alice is a cousin of Bernie, or the devil himself, provided the devil responds to 
incentives and knows how to invest. We don't need to trust them at all."" 
There are of course incentives that live off the blockchain and outside the ethereum economy.  Knowing how to invest is different from executing on that knowledge.  But, if you were not intending to tread on the territory of how meatspace might actually interact with the perfect mathematical crystals of interlocking ethereal contracts, then perhaps I am commenting on the wrong thread.  If by ""investment fund"" you mean some delegation of authority by owners of physical assets to a manager, and the redistribution of real returns from the holding, buying and selling of physical assets, then I think you need to consider the flesh and blood part of the equation.  For example, bringing gold into the ethereum investment universe at some point requires a warehouseman.  She hires guards with big guns to keep the assets safe.  And even though she may issue receipts for that gold in accounts of ethereal splendor, when those guards grow sleepy or are bought off, the value of those receipts will likely drop, suddenly and unhappily.  
Now, I do realize that it is possible to fantasize about a world in which no gold can leave or enter the warehouse without a smart contract insisting on a full accounting, and the weighing machinery itself is protected from false measure by another smart contract tied to a measure judged honest by the consensus of a distributed crowd, etc., etc..  I myself am more interested in what ethereum might be able to do within the sadly flawed world I wake up in each morning.  In this world, delegating portfolio trading authority to Alice IS trusting Alice, and this is a feature of that particular relationship, not a flaw.  I hope other, less rewarding, delegations in day-to-day life can be contracted away.  The ultimate questions are not ""how do we get rid of all trust relationships"" but ""how do we best (most efficiently) move the trust to the activities that are most productive, and make those trusted activities auditable.

If Ethereum wants to be *different* - wants to be *better*, then this tiresome pump/dump framework cannot be the model for it.  **Instead**, long term **price-insensitive rewards** need to be given (think of the long game).   We should give investors a return of Ether like a fixed income contract that pays well into the future, but instead of a fixed amount, they get a percentage of transaction fees for X blocks. 

So Mr Investo, for example, pays 1 BTC, and gets 0.01% of all tx fees for the next ten years.  This decouples the price sensitivity to the currency - allowing us to keep the price low (ie healthy for the economy) to remove the conflict of interest and allow proper inflation to occur without risk to the initial investors.

It encourages this core group of developers and investors to maximize economic activity, rather than price appreciation &amp; scarcity.",0,t1_cf70tp1,t3_1wwzeu,t3_1wwzeu,1391545759,,1,False,,1432251741,1391545341,cardevitoraphicticia,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,1,,cf70tp1,True,0

"Lets put the fundraiser in simple terms that everyone can understand. Everyone should agree that all investments should have a proper risk/reward ratio. This project itself has a lot of risk and potentially a lot of reward, so neither can outweigh the other. Now lets look at this objectively from that perspective.

Ethereum project;

Risk = Very High

Reward = Very High

Founders;

Risk = 0%

Reward=100%

Early adopters;

Risk = 100%

Reward = ?

Put that on a graph. Does that seem like a fair transaction to you?

Just look at the risk/reward ratio and it is way out of line, bordering on insanity. Hubris and Greed comes to mind. If you were the world's greatest cook and asked a venture capitalist or businessman to fund your new restaurant, Guess who makes the most money? Whoever takes the most risk. That's the guy who is paying for the risk out of his own pocket. It's been that way since the beginning of time. Granted, if you have risked a lot of your time and mental energy, you deserve payment for assuming that risk of your time and potential energy as sweat equity.

This is the only project that I have ever heard of that the founders have no sweat equity, no equity in capital and want all the rewards before the business even opens and then will ask the investment community to fund the entire project before it even starts and assume all of the risk.

The current investment model is appalling and downright thievery of the bitcoin community. Vitalik, please quit trying to instill a sense of fear and demand by constantly bringing up ""whales"" as an excuse for this model. That's just lame and I can't believe people will fall for that (edit...yes I can believe some people will). We can all guess whose idea and where those tactics were borne from.

They need to offer more ETH per bitcoin, lower the MAX to an acceptable level and therefore the pre-mine. And lower their shares of the coin to a level that doesn't reflect a persona of greed. If they are right and follow through, they can still be multi-millionaires by changing the structure in a way that it is not overly diluted and fair and equitable to early investors. The way it is structured now, they are punishing you for being an early adopter and instantly becoming wealthy without any risk at all.

I feel that if you are going to ask the investment community to fund the entire project sight unseen, then there must be checks and balances of risk/reward for founders and early adopters. This project is NOT a slam dunk, there is immense risk to go along with the rewards they are alluding to. Therefore the founders must take some risk themselves and give opportunity for early adopters to gain reward.

"Wait a second here - and please forgive me as I'm *very* new to all of this.  In fact, if I'm missing something here please tell me.

The fact that a ""company"" wouldn't remain in business due to scrutiny makes sense.  But we're talking about easy to write, simple to duplicate scripts that could be directed at ripping someone off.

Let's say someone says there is a contract/service that will put incoming money into an escrow account or protect it in some way.  As a developer I'm very familiar with conditional branches and I'm just as familiar with the difficulty humans have in following conditionals - especially when math or edge cases crop up.

I believe in open source code and your arguments are used in support of it.  However I get the impression that these contracts are more like snippets of JavaScript, written for specific applications.  People used to trust these snippets because they were designed for a very specific purpose, but even though the source was plainly available they generally weren't reviewed by any number of people.  Remember all the extra bullshit people had inadvertently placed on their MySpace profiles when that was popular?  A huge proportion of users cannot or *will* not read even the most rudimentary code snippets.

The difference between Amazon and some scammer using Ethereum is that Amazon would be gutted alive by the legal system, has reputation to lose, and would almost certainly be subject to reversal of charges if the contracts were found to be misleading.

"Hi, this is something that matters to me.

But first, I'm not sure I understand your '50 dollars' comment. It's indeed very likely we'll see native mobile Ethereum clients right out of the gate, either built as reference clients, or based on community projects. These will be free, as I'd expect them to be. For reference, see this potential Objective-c Client project: http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/629/ethereum-objectivec. Android is a no-brainer.

Second, these clients will support any Ethereum Dapps. We're already factoring mobile phone displays for the distributed GUIs powering Ethereum, either as HTML and/or QT packages spread across bitttorrent nodes. On that topic, I encourage you to read this article by our CTO Gavin Wood at http://insightsintoamodernworld.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/apps-what-web-30-looks-like.html. It's very early days, but Gavin will be presenting mockups of this type of interface at our London event on May 9th. Don't think smart contracts, think 'decentralized web'.

Third, an anecdote: Emerging economies tend to skip technology generations. For example, in the Philippines few have landlines, but smart phones are everywhere. In Kenya, by 2009, mobile payments had already been adopted by 40 percent of the adult population, facilitating ~10 percent of the country's GDP. This may not mean much to you, but you should have seen the Billions invested by companies back then in Europe, attempting to push 'mobile payments' as a 'thing'. Project Oscar would like a word, please (http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/project-oscar-mobile-payments)

Finally, and this is my favorite topic, using reputation in place of collaterals. In Europe, when you need a loan, you use your house or car to 'back' the loan so to speak. What about countries where people do not necessarily have such assets? Are they out of luck? Well, in East Africa, Chamas (social groups - thank you John Samson Karanja for introducing me to them) could be a solution. Peers vouch for a group member, literally collateralizing debt with reputation. I'd love nothing more but to see this system operating globally, as opposed to the local communities where it currently strives. 

This is when one realizes that not only emerging economies could benefit from a project such as Ethereum (Somalia, with its absent rule of law, might be a prime candidate), but that actually, our own economies have a thing or two to learn on the topic. Microfinance, decentralized crowdfunding, and peer to peer insurance could indeed be the saving graces of many countries' economies.

"&gt; Even if they could be drained, this would make it entirely trustful that the owner sets up the thing the same way.

Good point. I was assuming a trusted owner of the contract which defeats the purpose of many contracts and one of the amazing novelties of Ethereum.

&gt; A solution is not a burn-over but basically just forking it and having everyone switch at the same block. You would have the program able to do both protocols at the same time, and have the change take a fairly long time after release. But this is difficult, makes switching non-optional, and it is quite possible that some people will be screwed...

Yes, this is one approach. I am a fan of contract-only solutions rather than Ethereum platform solutions. Here is an attempt at a similar fork approach, but contract only:

The new contract in blockchain v2 is initialized with a copy of the state of the old contract in v1.

That's all fine except for the v1 ether tied into the old contract. The v2 contract will have no v2 ether. If they are truly separate chains, then the next step in this solution would require cross chain exchange.

If the new contract is relying on a cross chain exchange maybe it's balances represent IOUs for v2 currency? I'm not quite sure how this could actually work.

It's messy and yet it still appeals to me. For one, it doesn't require waiting on, or convincing, the core Ethereum devs to agree to, or implement. If we want truly trustless then we don't want to give them too much power. The other reason is the I want to handle the case where ""v2"" is not really ""version 2"" but some alternate Ethereum coin, such as æthereum.

&gt; Hmm, perhaps you can solve that.. you copy over the money and contracts like a fork any, and then also have burn over. It will get doubled either way, for everyone, in effect not mattering.

In this example, miners bring 18,000,000 ETH into the world each year, in perpetuity.


&gt; If you believe the demand for ETH due to usage and speculation will exceed the liquid supply, then it makes sense to speculate.  Bitcoin's inflation rate has been quite high over the last couple of years, with a sizable monetary base and its price has risen significantly.  I would argue nearly all of this value in Bitcoin was speculative and most still is.  Only recently is a bit of a fundamental economy developing in the Bitcoin space -- yet even much of that is based on choice rather than need: people choose to pay in BTC instead of other available payment methods.  In addition to speculative interest, Ethereum will have a fundamental economy driving demand for ETH from day one.  There will be actual demand for ETH from users and distributed apps that require it and only it to operate.

At this point nobody knows what the supply/demand dynamics will be.  We do anticipate that many purchasers of ETH will do so to hold long term, so that ETH cannot be considered part of the liquid supply.  

We do know that supply will grow linearly.  If you think demand will grow linearly or slower-than-linearly then speculation is a bad idea.   If you think the traditional adoption S-curve will prevail, in which there is a significant exponential growth period of the Ethrereum economy, then speculation might be warranted.

"The market price is ultimately going to depend on:
1) Supply vs. Demand: Does demand exceed supply, and does growth of demand exceed inflation.
2) Usefulness of the protocol: Can Ethereum really do what the founders think it can do?
3) Ecosystem: Will people develop awesome apps to take advantage of the protocol?
4) Will transaction fees (payable only in ether) be set at the appropriate level (or float to the appropriate level) so that the protocol isn't too cheap or too expensive to use.

You are using a supply-side argument--that the people generating the ether will just pluck a price out of thin air, which may be cheaper than the presale price. I'm using a demand-side argument--that the price of ether will float based on how demand relates to supply. If this thing is amazing, then demand is likely to severely outstrip supply.

Simple--it was amazing, and they wanted to use it RIGHT NOW rather than in a year, and supply (limited by the number of beta spots) was overwhelmed by demand.

So with ether, there will be a set amount...1.5X...available in the beginning, and then 0.0333 per month after that from mining (total of 0.4X per year).* So...does Ethereum do amazing things which causes an influx of users/speculators to buy up lots of ether in order to use or speculate? Or does it languish, with all that ether just sitting there with no buyers? That depends on the strength of the protocol, the ecosystem, and in no small part, the marketing.

"First of all let me say that I'm elated with the direction that the Ethereum team is taking regarding mining. It's thinking in the right direction.

I am a little bit concerned that making it fool proof may end up making it so complicated that we create edge cases that get exploited once the ledger is live.

I think the major problem with mining algorithms is that they are misnamed.

Mining is not about expending effort or, finding things or even being decentralized (although the last one is a subset of the intent).

“Mining” is about hosting, protecting, processing and appending the ledger of active transactions. It would probably more ideally be called “Maintenance”. Maintenance needs to be set up in such a fashion that those doing the maintaining never have an incentive or alternatively never get an opportunity to mess with the original intent of the blockchain. Decentralization seems to mesh well with this intent.

The design of ASICs that do general purpose computing is bit of a contradiction in terms. If ASICs emerge that maintain the original intent of the ledger, I cannot see how resisting them would be anything but inefficient to the intent of the ledger. They would be an incredible boon to computer science as they would essentially be “blockchain machines”. If a group becomes dominant (which will happen anyway, if we succeed at general purpose, Amazon will become the dominant Ether mining company), they will have to do so because they “maintain” the blockchain better, cheaper, faster than anyone else. Bitcoin’s mining community cannot claim that at the moment because they only protect the ledger against fraud, they don’t guarantee any of its other functions.",0,t1_cg867wg,t3_20zhvz,t3_20zhvz,False,,6,False,,1433003766,1395398829,sjalq,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,6,,cg867wg,True,0

The end goal being a platform on which any arbitrary group of people can for a decentralized form of self governance without need for any specifically design structure (or at least one that is easily re-designable). The original simplified idea was to host the ""laws"" on github so people could propose edits and things could be merged. Much like project development except that they form the laws by which the group would be govern.

I'm looking forward to trying to implement this in a system where the rules which are designed are automatically enforced. But i have many trick to learn in contract writing first to get a feel for the best way to set this up. Also there are ton of different options for things such as voting method to reputation systems. I'm not sure exactly what to implement and what to leave out. Should it be plug and play style components so if people feel the organization needs to be modified it doesn't require a complete overhaul. But if you do this way you need to make sure that there is good integration with all the systems you use. Also you might want choices in the matter of maybe you don't care if the forums for a group ar centrally hosted but ideally the rules of the forum are still based in ethereum.

I had a nutty idea, send part of transaction fees to funders. Makes funders less sensitive to both in- and deflation. But it is nutty, really i dont know the economics well either.

And should be clear wether or not ethereum developers or funders can also claim the bounties themselves.(i reckon that is fine, careful though..)

Bounties for 'issuance'(effectively, but locked in the contract since the start of ethereum) does have a nice property that the more ethers are worth, the more incentive to forfill the bounty, so if the price goes up, bounties get forfilled, putting more ether in circulation.

"No and I consider it to be a closed matter. Dan and I are very different businessmen with both different vision and philosophy. It's better for the ecosystem that we are running separate ventures. I haven't had any involvement or equity in I3 since mid-October- prior to the launch of protoshares nor any involvement in Angelshares or other product launches. 

When I was the CEO, the business plan and the fiduciary obligations of the company were very different and more traditionally structured like a Silicon Valley startup. We had a single investor from China and all shares were owned by employees or associates of the company. I watched the mastercoin fundraiser and was deeply concerned with the lack of clarity about its status as a security in the United States hence I didn't want to embrace a swap style funding mechanism without first having significant legal due diligence and in a host jurisdiction that had more approachable regulators. 

Protoshares was originally intended to be only a market pricing mechanism established by third parties for the overall value of I3 and its promises moving into a series A. In essence, we would have had a number vetted by the traders on the exchanges for what I3 was worth providing a negotiating window for some interested valley VCs. 

At the end of the day, I believed that the primary product wasn't Bitshares but rather Keyhotee and its user base. Bitcoin is a fragmented ecosystem with terrible UX/UI, limited consumer appeal, and almost no emphasis on teaching best practices to protect consumer funds and privacy. Keyhotee was intended to fix these issues by starting as a curated chrome browser extension using an HD Wallet + PGP key generated from the same seed and having tight integration with webmail clients like gmail. One could move to a full featured desktop client via node.js and the mobile space via phonegap. Most importantly, you have a product in front of consumers in a few weeks and they are helping you make it better. That’s called building an ecosystem.  

Bitshares would have been a class of next generation specialized blockchains designed to enable decentralized exchange of any digitized asset- ironically this approach could have worked very well with sidechains. The associated DAC framework I felt was premature, underdeveloped, and also required the more generalized, turing complete framework that Buterin later developed for Ethereum. I don't see how one can claim perfect clarity for how to build autonomous sustainable businesses and then promise specific profits (+5%). When combined with a fundraiser, it seems naïve at best and criminal at worst.      
Honestly, my primary interest in the original Bitshares was the idea of P2P price discovery for cryptocurrencies. Combining this notion with better versions of localbitcoins, one wouldn’t need exchanges for small scale currency swaps allowing mini-satoshi squares to functionally become the ATMS of the developing world. I care very deeply about microfinance and onboarding the unbanked.  

That said, Ethereum does not view itself as a competitor to I3 or its affiliates. We seek to build a comprehensive, open sourced ecosystem that is accessible to all and interoperable with as many standards as possible. The goal here has always been unity and innovation. Focusing on petty personal feuds benefits no one and comes at the expense of time and mental energy.

We are acutely aware of the community sentiment regarding a possible pre-mine.  We are also weighing the value of having ETH to pay salaries which keeps our individual and corporate interests more completely aligned with those of Genesis Sale ETH buyers.  Whether there is a pre-mine or not, we will need to have lots of ETH on day one to pay out obligations (e.g. salaries to developers), to help fund third parties who are developing DApps on Ethereum, and possibly to help stabilize the currency in the early days.  We are looking at ways to reduce the pre-mine significantly and possibly even eliminate it.  If we do end up eliminating it or having a very small pre-mine, we will have to buy ETH in the market which creates other issues.

We certainly don't want the role of a central bank, but in the early days of bootstrapping the system, it may be prudent to ensure that the currency is stable while new businesses on the system are making their services available and figuring out the implementational details of their business models.  Some third parties have already indicated that they are interested in setting up trade desks to stabilize any currency fluctuations (and be paid for taking risks in these activities).  Such groups will likely assist ETH to remain in a non-volatile trading band and they will likely have other businesses that depend on an ETH price that is not excessively volatile.  In the event that there is not enough ETH liquidity at certain times and exchange rates rise rapidly, we may want to have a pool of readily available ETH that we can draw from to reduce drastic upward volatility and enable businesses on the system to operate economically while the economy grows and gains stability.

"Why would you donate bitcoins, if you need them later to purchase ethereum.

I think if you view it from a capital allocation model, you would need to rely on a very efficient group think to allocate enough bitcoin to get ethereum rolling, but then have enough capital leftoever to realize a investment in ethereum when it goes live, and that this scenario vs a premine IPO would provide a better return.

Also what happens when the donation drive fails, then ethereum has to come back with the IPO model.

I think the IPO model should go forward, I would like to see a better understanding of how the bitcoin raised gets spent, and also how the ethereum gets allocated.  My issue isnt the premine, its that they are getting BTC upfront, and they are getting ethereum pre allocated to special parterns and early angels. Which means I am funding ethereum with my bitcoin but I getting diluted by other insiders, when we are taking the exact same risks at such an early stage. Unless I am mistaken.

Much more disclosure needs to happen, also I am concerned that no-one in the team has any experience handling or managing large project money or organizations.   Funding 5-10-20 million is no small sum without a some business management experience.

 [**Product differentiation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product%20differentiation): 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and [marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing), **product differentiation** (or simply differentiation) is the process of distinguishing a [product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business\)) or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular [target market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market). This involves differentiating it from [competitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition)' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by [Edward Chamberlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Chamberlin) in his 1933 Theory of Monopolistic Competition.

&gt;The pre-sale is blockchain-based, and I have a python script that will be released alongside the other sale materials that will list the table of all purchases. If the genesis block does not match this table, then it will be trivial to notice this. In fact, we may even opt to have pyethereum generate the genesis block directly from the purchases taken from the BTC blockchain.

If you guys do run a trustless pre-sale, It would set a wonderful precedent.

I'll have to lament here, but it sounds like all purchases with BTC will be transparent in the blockchain, the exchange rate for each purchase will also be transparent, and the genesis block will show that all purchased ether has been generated.

There's just one more important step: ether collection. Will an escrow function be used to hold BTC until ether has been generated/etc. (according to some predefined terms), and will investors be able to collect their investment using a private key?

"Sounds important. But doesnt neccesarily affect ethereum?

I am sure some dusty-minded engineers are thinking they're doing it for efficiency. Cant help but wonder if they looked at youtube videos crossing, that is going to be a lot of data..

Whats the status of FOSS/software activist groups trying to affect/do HTTP development? Could there be any way to both be able to cache and have it anonymous?(seems unlikely, but.. crypto is very wtf)

So basically https the private key is at the server, but they mitm it because the certificate authority can say 'this pubkey is good too', and then a intermediate server uses https, and then retransmits with a different privkey. One way around this could be to just start a separate certificate authority? Edit: that wouldnt help, the browser would just tell you it doesnt trust the pubkey, not give you a way around.. You could add another layer of encryption, so then they would have to add another layer of mitm, haha.

Btw should use [Tor](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/), btw. That said, even when using tor-to-clearnet, this would decrease privacy a tiny bit, as the exit node and snoopers beyond it can see more.(darknet is unaffected by this) Of course, it is *much* less efficient for internet traffic. Note: wikipedia mentions https being developped for tor nodes.. I think they mean the *exit* nodes can enter malicious stuff, the intermediate ones can only tell where it came from and where to send it.(But not where the subsequent node will send it)

People already thought of fake searches to decrease tracking.(when i saw it, it was poorly implemented) Fake browsing is also possible. Main problem is how to do all the thing the browser does without showing the user anything, and how to figure out the 'real' links.

If they try to block people will try encode it into data looks otherwise, once they try block that, wasting a lot of cpu, they will hurt businesses that are accidentally also blocked, and people trying to not be tracked(stalked) all the time go stenography.

"The miners will enter into the market but with much less funds slowly over time.

But beside that I think for the future development that power concentration would be very bad. The ether funds of the founders are time-locked so they cannot influence the market, the miners will need much time to create funds and if supply is too low the price will skyrocket, driving more people into mining and makes investment in mining very high, so the price and mining cost will be in an equilibrium. If the monopolistic investor decide one day to cash out the miners will suffer a lot from a price crash and the whole ethereum project could be attacked in such a way.

"Great seeing you at the expo Piotr!

&gt; Well, in Ethereum each account and each contract have their own data storage. There is no centralized data storage, which means custom data can only be stored in this way. This in turn means that there will never be one unique DNS in Ethereum, just a set of DNSs each different for each contract that creates them. Depending on which one you will read from, you may get different results for the same domain.

I'll answer this by analogy:

&gt; In the traditional DNS system, there is no single centralized data storage server, which means that there will never be one unique top-level domain; just a set of top-level domains with one for each country or organization that creates one. Depending on whether you go to bitcoin.com or bitcoin.org, you may get different results from the same domain.

Same argument applies here. A few namecoins will likely become the most popular, and everyone will refer to them.

&gt; Next, the currency needs an issuer, which makes things more complicated.

Actually, you can create issuer-less currencies. All you do is keep a running counter of the last block and allow one transaction per block to automatically assign an additional X units to the block.coinbase. If you want a currency that can track the US dollar or gold or the CPI, then yes, you need either an issuer or a financial derivatives scheme plus price feeds, which we have quite openly admitted is somewhat more complicated.

&gt; Another approach that might work for this could come in a form of Ethereum having awareness of what happens in other currencies. One could create a contract that creates a piece of currency in Ethereum each time a transaction sends money to a given address in say, Bitcoin. This approach would work well if you want to have proof-of-burn currencies, but wouldn't work too well if you would want to redeem the currency back in its original blockchain, unless that system would have some knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain. 

Umm... I think there was an announcement made a few days ago that [pretty much solved](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/12349/side-chains-challenges-potential/) that particular issue.

&gt; Now the question is, what incentive would anyone have to be putting that data into the blockchain?

Two possibilities. (1) as a loss leader for other services (just like the free APIs provided by blockchain.info), (2) the contract would require a one-cent micropayment in order to access it from another contract.

&gt; If we wanted to include data in a trust-less way for say, a transaction happening in Bitcoin, we would need to provide the transaction data, then add the merkle branch and a block header to prove that the transaction is a part of a block, and then perhaps an entire block header chain to show that the blocks are not fake?

Basically, you need to have a contract which acts as a self-contained SPV client for the external blockchain. I describe it somewhat more in detail in the above linked article on side-chains.

&gt; What is the incentive of creating useful contracts in Ethereum? 

Same thing that incentivizes people to write open-source libraries now. That usually means either (1) it's useful enough that your personal benefit from the contract outweights the cost, or (2) as something to show off and draw attention to yourself when seeking out customers or employers. Incentive of development is likely 20x lower, true, but cost of development is also 20x lower.

&gt; If you create the most useful service there is but the only way to communicate with it is through a command line or creating some code, few people will use it. Similarly in Ethereum creating a contract might only be half of the job. The other half would be creating a good user interface for people to be able to use your contract in a meaningful way. I think this aspect is not emphasized enough at this point and may put a lot of people off when they get their first impressions of Ethereum.

It's not emphasized enough at this point because the GUI toolkits do not yet exist. They will soon, and it's been in the plans for a long time to switch emphasis to the interface side at that point.

&gt; I personally think the Ethereum team might benefit from having a more extrovert person that focuses on explaining Ethereum to non-technical people, and bringing in Vitalik to focus on the technical aspects of what they are developing. Using Vitalik for everything isn't all that optimal.

Agreed. I would love to see Charles and Gavin out there more. I'm much better as a coder and cryptoeconomist than to talk to every public audience out there. We need a balance.

&gt; Lets name all the denominations

People only need to remember ether, finney and wei. The others are just there for future-compatibility. The reason why I added different names is because I think it's ridiculous what's going on in Bitcoin now where everything costs 0.0xx BTC, and if it goes up even more it will start costing 0.00xx BTC or x mBTC. Forcing everyone to say ""zero point zero zero"" or ""milli"" every time when that's the de facto default anyway is cruel and unusual punishment.

"&gt; Even if they could be drained, this would make it entirely trustful that the owner sets up the thing the same way.

Good point. I was assuming a trusted owner of the contract which defeats the purpose of many contracts and one of the amazing novelties of Ethereum.

&gt; A solution is not a burn-over but basically just forking it and having everyone switch at the same block. You would have the program able to do both protocols at the same time, and have the change take a fairly long time after release. But this is difficult, makes switching non-optional, and it is quite possible that some people will be screwed...

Yes, this is one approach. I am a fan of contract-only solutions rather than Ethereum platform solutions. Here is an attempt at a similar fork approach, but contract only:

The new contract in blockchain v2 is initialized with a copy of the state of the old contract in v1.

That's all fine except for the v1 ether tied into the old contract. The v2 contract will have no v2 ether. If they are truly separate chains, then the next step in this solution would require cross chain exchange.

If the new contract is relying on a cross chain exchange maybe it's balances represent IOUs for v2 currency? I'm not quite sure how this could actually work.

It's messy and yet it still appeals to me. For one, it doesn't require waiting on, or convincing, the core Ethereum devs to agree to, or implement. If we want truly trustless then we don't want to give them too much power. The other reason is the I want to handle the case where ""v2"" is not really ""version 2"" but some alternate Ethereum coin, such as æthereum.

&gt; Hmm, perhaps you can solve that.. you copy over the money and contracts like a fork any, and then also have burn over. It will get doubled either way, for everyone, in effect not mattering.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

"Charles is very good at explaining this stuff. If governments start asking you to explain yourselves in hearings, send him.

And speaking of which, I know it would be much more convenient to set everything up in Canada, but I think it would be much better if you set it up in Switzerland or Iceland. Canada is just too close to US, and the Harper government is almost as bad in these sort of things from what I understand (seems to favor mass surveillance and other stuff like that). I don't think it's going to be much of a difference between setting it up in US and doing it in Canada, ultimately.

Switzerland is not perfect either, and in the past few years at least has started bowing down to US government more and more, like when they [shut down Assange's account](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11929034) based on a technicality (right around when US was doing everything it could to shut down Wikileaks - but I'm sure that was just a coincidence...). 

Then, last year, for the first time ever, Switzerland agreed to [share banking information](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-tax-switzerland-idUSBRE9B80S320131210) about its clients with the US. That's basically the one thing Switzerland is known for (customer privacy), and they gave that out like nothing to US. 

Now they're trying to promote themselves as the ""anti-NSA"" country or something, saying their datacenters are held in bunkers and whatnot, and that they want to be the [world's data haven against mass surveillance](http://www.securityweek.com/swiss-set-sights-becoming-worlds-data-vault). If it's going to turn out to be as much as a haven as it was for banking, then it probably won't mean much.

Iceland might be a good second choice, and might even be a better choice than Switzerland. Wikileaks got some pretty good protection there, and the whole country decided not to bail out the banks. They even made Visa pay for the blockade against Wikileaks.

So if Ethereum starts a financial revolution that endangers the world's banks, Iceland is probably the safest place where you want to be. They've also recently created the [AuroraCoin](http://auroracoin.org/) so they seem pretty forward thinking about this stuff. You could even tell them to build AuroraCoin on top of Ethereum :)

If you set it up in Switzerland, they might actually turn out to be your biggest enemy, because a huge part of their economy relies on its banks. Yes, normally we'd like to think that Switzerland will see common sense, and *want* to be part of the new revolutionary financial systems built on top of Ethereum. But usually when incumbents are threatened by disruptive innovations, they get very aggressive about it and want to squash them.

The more I think about it, the more I think you should strongly consider Iceland for your headquarters.

There are a *ton* of reasons why they may come after you if Ethereum fulfills its vision. From your typical ""we want to stop money laundering"", to ""facilitating piracy"" or ""gambling"" with P2P apps that can't be shut down, to users avoiding taxes (and blaming the platform for it, as usual, because it makes a nice easy scape goat that's usually much easier to shut down or limit). But I think the biggest one will be facilitating the elimination of the banking system. So I don't think this should be taken lightly.

Be as legal as you can, try to talk to goverments ahead of time (including the US gov which has far reaching influence all over the world), and explain what Ethereum is and what it can facilitate (good things), the way the Bitcoin Foundation did in US (and seemed to work out pretty well). Because if you're not ahead of these things, the media itself will start to run with the ""underground"" ""dirty"" ""crimes"" that Ethereum makes possible, and then they won't believe you anymore.

Even today some of them still talk about Bitcoin from a drug crime point of view, and I've noticed a lot of ""normal"" people buy into that story, and think that's what Bitcoin or other cryptocoins are *mainly* used for, because the media puts such an emphasis on that ""intriguing"" aspect of them.

But ultimately, it's better to be in a safe place, too - just in case the US government and others don't buy your story.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time.

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

"The problem with any discussion in the cryptocurrency space is the prevalence of Austrian-school terminology, and the general confusion as to what deflation and inflation mean.

Just to avoid confusion, let's use inflation/deflation to refer to price changes strictly, without talking about the quantity of money available.

So what does it mean to say that Ethereum (or Bitcoin) is deflationary? The argument goes something like this; the supply of money is increasing linearly (or sublinearly), but the demand for money is exponential, as more goods appear, and the number of people increase.  Therefore, over time, the value of money will increase, thus leading to deflation.

The problem with this argument is the claim about the growth of the supply of money.  This is only true with an incredibly restrictive definition of money supply; basically limited to M0.  Even there, M0 is no good since it includes ""guaranteed"" deposits (usually with a central bank).  So really, we're making the claim that the money supply is equivalent to the supply of specie.

The problem is that the actual amount of money circulating in an economy is a market phenomenon, because metrics of money supply have to take into account credit markets.  At the moment, neither Ethereum nor Bitcoin have even rudimentary credit markets, so this is not as much of a factor.

But if either coin is successful, credit markets will evolve -- people with money will seek to increase their money by purchasing cash-like instruments (demand deposits, savings accounts, bonds, stocks, real estate); which allows the actual specie to circulate, while simultaneously allowing them to ""keep"" the money based on the liquidity of the instruments, and earning interest on the money in the meantime.

So, in short, I don't buy the argument that either coin is deflationary.

Peercoin with its proof of state setup already is more energy efficient than Bitcoin and going forward if the network grew would become even more so. It does seem somewhat important to me, especially if you had a massive number of transactions (a global currency), that using a proof of stake system which was energy efficient could be very important and a huge advantage.

I saw in another post of yours that you said that proof of stake is difficult to have linear inflation with. I do know Peercoin does have inflation, though I am not especially educated on the topic and linear inflation might not be the same thing.

&gt;  Why don't you release the software for free, no pre-mine, and then settle to build a services company on top of the network?

That was indeed an idea that we had earlier on. However, what we realized is that if we try to extract a profit from services on top of Ethereum then things will actually be much worse for the community. We would need to hobble our services with fees, just like every other company that sells services inevitably has to (eg. Bitcoin exchanges' trading fees) in order to generate revenue. We do not want to do this. We want to release awesome platforms and awesome tools, and make them available to everyone at a 0% fee aside from Etherium network fees. Premining and fundraising, on the other hand, provide a guaranteed source of income that mean that we can focus our actual work 100% solely on making the protocol and infrastructure as good as possible for everyone.

"Actually in the grand web 3.0 scheme, I'm not sure that tracking the cosign accounts in a contract (ie in the blockchain) is the right way to do it. I think that this should be a wallet feature implemented with some kind of ""wallet storage"" not shared with the world (similar to the HTML5 localStorage). The user should also be able to sync his ""wallet storage"" content on whatever device he use. So for now a contract storage would works, but eventually I think that this is not the right place for this kind of data.

Similarly I think that the transaction should be created directly by the ethereum client (via a Ðapp UI) and not by a ""deployment contract"". I can create whatever contract I want, and in this case I see no reason to require a worldwide blockchain consensus about the creation step itself.

About the merging of vote I agree that a separate vote counter would be a valid solution (and optionally a rejection counter). But as the blockchain is a very expensive storage I feel that the data shouldn't be redundant. My idea was that if voter A and D said `yes`, and voters B, C and E hasn't voted yet we could encode that state as `10010`. Then if voter B says `yes` we simply use the bitwise OR `|= 01000` so the new state will be `11010`.

"&gt;A signed transaction is an encrypted message, not our private key. What you're talking about using the same private key on a completely different network.

I think that's what the idea actually means. You encrypt a message to proof the ownership of the address. You don't actually give up your private key but rather 'signs' a message using your private key.

Actually ECDSA is pretty flexible in terms of message you can put inside. You can actually use it for something other than transaction. For example you can prove the ownership of an address by signing a message 'Sound_Paper owns this address"" and give the cipher text to other people and they can use your public key to verify that the message originates actually originates from the owner of the address(that's actually what Sign Message function does in Bitcoin Core)

&gt;If I give you a message, and tell you to encrypt it, and then observe other encrypted packets I can deduce the key even on a secure cipher stream.

Well ECDSA is safe from known-ciphertext attack (the attack you just described) as long as you are using random k. That's the reason why currently you can still reuse the address. The signing itself is pretty safe as long as the algorithm is known. That's why probably the simplest way to implement aethereum is to use the Sign Message function in Bitcoin Core as it has already been vouched for by many people (and it is pretty flexible in terms of the message that can be signed).

In my original post I said the protocol should cap the amount of wei per block, but thinking a little more about the problem, it might be better to cap the number of turing clicks per block. Users could then submit their contracts with a payment-per-click figure, and miners would select contracts to process based on the highest return-on-click. By keeping state across blocks, there would not be any problem of figuring out which contracts to choose because each chosen contract will get executed to completion or run out of wei.

Scammers will think like magicians and work through misdirection and expectations/assumptions.  usium, I believe the only way ethereum (and/or its ilk) will reduce/eliminate scams is if the user base switches their attitude to total paranoia; they assume that every contract, every address/account is a malevolent agent until proved neutral.  E.g., if you have not analyzed the code personally, nor have verified a digitally signed statement from an agent you trust that ties to the hash of the code (and you have checked the most recent key revocation list for that agents' public key), then caveat emptor!

"The problem with any discussion in the cryptocurrency space is the prevalence of Austrian-school terminology, and the general confusion as to what deflation and inflation mean.

Just to avoid confusion, let's use inflation/deflation to refer to price changes strictly, without talking about the quantity of money available.

So what does it mean to say that Ethereum (or Bitcoin) is deflationary? The argument goes something like this; the supply of money is increasing linearly (or sublinearly), but the demand for money is exponential, as more goods appear, and the number of people increase.  Therefore, over time, the value of money will increase, thus leading to deflation.

The problem with this argument is the claim about the growth of the supply of money.  This is only true with an incredibly restrictive definition of money supply; basically limited to M0.  Even there, M0 is no good since it includes ""guaranteed"" deposits (usually with a central bank).  So really, we're making the claim that the money supply is equivalent to the supply of specie.

The problem is that the actual amount of money circulating in an economy is a market phenomenon, because metrics of money supply have to take into account credit markets.  At the moment, neither Ethereum nor Bitcoin have even rudimentary credit markets, so this is not as much of a factor.

But if either coin is successful, credit markets will evolve -- people with money will seek to increase their money by purchasing cash-like instruments (demand deposits, savings accounts, bonds, stocks, real estate); which allows the actual specie to circulate, while simultaneously allowing them to ""keep"" the money based on the liquidity of the instruments, and earning interest on the money in the meantime.

So, in short, I don't buy the argument that either coin is deflationary.  At best we can say that it is long-term deflationary, but even there we need a ridiculous number of assumptions to make that claim.",0,t1_cgegzwo,t3_21l7rw,t3_21l7rw,False,,2,False,,1433112816,1396043050,andrewla,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cgegzwo,True,0

"&gt; If some of Maidsafe's technologies rise up to the challenge of crossing this bar then we'll be very happy to use them as our backbone.

We will be glad to see you there as well Vitalik. I believe Ethereum is another great project looking to achieve things never previously imagined.  Its tough, easy, happy and sad all at the same time working at this pace and attempting to read everyone about every project. I will try and summarise some key points regarding MaidSafe and hope it helps. 

We have written many papers and attended many events in this journey. We still find it hard to explain (well I do). I think this is not unusual for a big change. Bitcoin is also hard to explain to some folks. 

We will be launched soon and then will get a chance to measure, tune and check all algorithms. We have had a ton of review though over the years (I started all this in 1996 with a decentralised approach to linux servers that I had designed). In recent years since MaidSafe started (2006) I spent 8 months in a non English place to get peace to do the initial design. I then spent nearly a year travelling around Universities explaining and getting peer review. It's not the be all and end all, but we seek critique everywhere so happy to see it actually. We did work early on and spoke with many people in the field such as Vint Cerf and Deborah Gordon (of the Gordon institute in Stanford), presented at a google conference on scalability and a keynote at the british computer society xmas lecture etc. Also spent a lot of time on kademlia implementation and attacks/designs with Mario Kolberg (one of the the authors in the p2p handbook). A couple of us have spent many years on the cryptopp library (Wei's library) and that's a great place for some pretty deep cryptography questions and ideas. So we search everywhere for valid critique. It is a huge system to describe quickly and that seems to be the main reason for misunderstanding in many cases. None of this is proof of the whole network, but there is a lot of research and testing taken place, including three pre &amp; post doctorate research projects we sponsored for simulation and modelling.  Like everyone we try very hard to make sure we get the system tested as we go along. 

We hope to have some papers soon that further explain some the parts you are discussing or querying here. It may not be obvious or well explained how chained consensus groups work and how they prevent birthday paradox and related sybil type attacks. There was a paper on attack vectors from the data part of the network supposed to be available to the mailing list weeks ago, but it is still waiting on registration for the WWRF forum. We should have posted this paper on  arxiv. 

We will probably try and get the routing paper that explains some of the DHT theory underlying this posted in the next week or so. It will help a lot.  Routing relies on a reliable UDP that has pseudo tcp type connection oriented attributes. This has been worked on by Chris Kohlhoff (of c++ ASIO), Anthony Williams (c++ concurrency) and now another great boost developer Nail Douglas. These parts are critical for full decentralisation of all data in my opinion.

Where single entities (i.e. crypto currencies, structured data version handlers) are involved there are also asymm signatures involved as the chain mechanism cannot work for non group id's.  Currently this is RSA 4096 signatures. So there is a  lot we do not explain in detail, but there is a lot to it all (each client on the network has many crypto key pairs for different aspects, as well as revocation pairs).

I hope this helps folks a little, I think the papers will define more clearly and also show some mathematical modelling of some of these points. ",0,t1_cgblrny,t3_217fsm,t1_cgambcf,False,,7,False,,1433063078,1395768938,dirvine,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cgblrny,True,0

"See, that's the problem; I don't think that way. If there's one question that keeps me awake at night, it's the thought that perhaps everything I've sank my life into for the past 3 years is a technological and ideological dead end, and perhaps traditional centralized institution-based mechanisms based around corporations and banks and governments and incremental innovation respecting the existing establishment are actually the best way for society to move forward in solving the issues that really matter for the majority of people.

"Probably all contracts still have to be figured out or further refined. It is a platform or a cryptocurrency and contracts. Contract writers have to figure out things that work economically, and popularize it!

The namecoin issue could fairly easily be fixed, a namecoin contract could do ranges of namespaces, you could buy a range and send an address to a script instead to some piece of data. The script controls that bit of namespace by its output, or state. Maybe someone(the ethereum team?) might want to add a namecoin contract particularly to start off the tree of namecoin contracts, set a consensus point to start that off. (it would be a pita if browsers have to figure out from which namecoin that link is coming)

DAO investments can be held up, firstly for any interaction, you can apply reputation/stake systems(which havent been developed yet either) which could be used between developers and investors.(question in that is if the developers have enough reputation to wield) Secondly, there are all sorts of ways of attaching things onto the DAO script itself;

* It may need starting reputation/stake, 
* Need to buy a name in a namecoin, and perhaps other interactions with other scripts. 
* The wages of the developers can be encoded.

The developers cannot run away without losing the investment in the script, and the script may contain a feature where investors can vote to cancel and return some of their money, or there may be a timeout system. (Of course the development may be about developing the script itself, the script invested in would then just contain the investment features initially)

DAOs can be rather nebulous.. is Namecoin is not that much investment to write..(though i suppose we might want to think about how to do that thing best we can) Probably a reputation/stake DAO would be similarly nebulous. Tbh i am not sure if i would call them organizations. (automatons?)

"&gt; Can we just use Bitcoin instead of Torcoin? Isn’t money supposed to be fungible to all use cases? Perhaps not – Bitcoin’s transaction speed is too slow for a dynamic network allocating bandwidth – 10 to 60 minutes is far too long to negotiate with a relay. And payments have to be anonymous. So a fast-clearing (Fastcoin can clear a block in 12 seconds), fully anonymous (likeZerocoin) variant is needed.

You can use a system where a request only has a probability of winning a small amount, instead of always getting an absolutely miniscule amount. The amount has to be small, otherwise unlucky people get hit too hard.

This probability can presumably be simply based on block hashes, although i am [aware potential miner collusion](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/2758/#Comment_2758). Basically, only psuedorandom number agreed on indicates so, the 'provider' gets paid, and only then he has an incentive to try it on the actual blockchain.

It has to be DDOS proof though. Essentially, I suggested it before with servers and viewers. 'Viewers' have scripts they fund and pay out. Accessing servers you send messages that can also be used on the script, within a time-frame.

The 'request' message to servers can also be used by servers to punish viewers, by destroying coin on the script, but also on the side of the server.(cant cheaply destroy viewer coin)

The 'data accepted' message give the server a probability he will be able to get a payout from the script. The ability of the request to punish is used as discentive against viewers not sending coin.

To the above, speed is nearly irrelevant. The time frame can be days.

One attack is a viewer viewing stuff, and then playing both viewer and server to drain his account in the script. I reckon a solution is to have a minimum amount for it to work. No-one can extract more than that from the script.

Then viewers attacking that way, *can*, but the servers see it and blacklist that script. The script is subsequently useless, but still has the attackers viewers money in it, making the attack expensive.

A lesser solution is having lists of trusted servers in the script, and scripts can accept *if* they trust those servers.

 Edit: The above was conceived with just using ether as payment.. Doesnt contain any aspect of paying the developpers. The amount paid is unsure, one way is to just let viewers decide, and get rejected if they go too low. Dont see how you could connect it to a sub-coin, afaik, really i feel you kindah shouldnt.

I don't think the team of Ethereum get it. The whole reason that Bitcoin has become so huge is that it's been in the hands of the people since day one. Bitcoin has managed to build a lot of goodwill in the community because of this. The kids who mined in 2009 are some of its strongest proponents and entrepreneurs today.

The importance of community has recently been magnified by the rise of Dogecoin, which started out a joke, but has quickly passed most of the other altcoins with its innovation and utility.

While I think the people behind Ethereum are brilliant, I'm afraid that an IPO will prevent it from truly becoming mainstream. It will be another footnote in 5 years time, alongside all of the other great ideas that never took off (coloured coins, next, ripple etc.). Ethereum needs a strong community behind it, and I don't accept that it's just a marketing exercise (i.e. so let's set aside some funds for a few people to maintain a twitter).

As Amanojack said, the developers will become rich through mining and buying early if the project is even remotely promising in the first year.

Ethereum can serve in the same role as bitcoin and I agree that ethereum represents a dramatic step-up from bitcoin. However bitcoin's well-established role in a business sense -- and especially in the minds of millions of consumers -- has made it unassailable as a consumer transaction medium.

"Afaik ethereum uses a key-value system. if you use `contract.storage[H(name_string)+k]=..stuff..`, the values of `k` you never set dont require storage. Would seem to me that allowing too high values of `k` essentially decrease the difficulty for attackers, only needing partial collisions. (I think the allowed range of `k` has to be really large for it to really be a problem though..)

Still i prefer the idea of a separate id-contract . However, the second contract doesnt seem neccessary because k∈{0,1} should be fine.

     contract.storage[H(name_string)] =ethereum_address
     contract.storage[ethereum_address] =name_string           #Optional
     contract.storage[ethereum_address+1] =id_contract_address #Optional

On the id-contract:

     contract.storage[H(""reddit/username"")] = ""meeee""

That said, you could do it differently again, the namecoin just pointing to contracts from names and the contracts storing human-readable-names, ethereum addresses.

&gt; As for accessing data from other contracts, the EXTRO command from the ethereum whitepaper looks like it does the trick. Not sure if a method for getting previous block hashes is possible, though.

"&gt; Nobody, including Satoshi had an advantage at any time during the project's history.

Absolutely false IMO. Satoshi had the advantage that he knew about Bitcoin from day 1, and he posted the information on a specific set of forums that he chose and not on other forums. 99.9999%+ of the world's population had no chance whatsoever to do anything with Bitcoin simply because they didn't know about it before 25% of all currency units that will ever exist were released. Meanwhile, in Ethereum, I specifically forced the project to have an infinitely growing currency supply so there is no such thing as ""25% of all currency units that will ever exist"" in the first place.

I think that making distribution models that are ""technically fair"" is a futile task; the best approach is to look at how we can create a distribution model that is as widely dispersed as possible, and that necessarily involves delivering currency units to multiple constituencies.

"No and I consider it to be a closed matter. Dan and I are very different businessmen with both different vision and philosophy. It's better for the ecosystem that we are running separate ventures. I haven't had any involvement or equity in I3 since mid-October- prior to the launch of protoshares nor any involvement in Angelshares or other product launches. 

When I was the CEO, the business plan and the fiduciary obligations of the company were very different and more traditionally structured like a Silicon Valley startup. We had a single investor from China and all shares were owned by employees or associates of the company. I watched the mastercoin fundraiser and was deeply concerned with the lack of clarity about its status as a security in the United States hence I didn't want to embrace a swap style funding mechanism without first having significant legal due diligence and in a host jurisdiction that had more approachable regulators. 

Protoshares was originally intended to be only a market pricing mechanism established by third parties for the overall value of I3 and its promises moving into a series A. In essence, we would have had a number vetted by the traders on the exchanges for what I3 was worth providing a negotiating window for some interested valley VCs. 

At the end of the day, I believed that the primary product wasn't Bitshares but rather Keyhotee and its user base. Bitcoin is a fragmented ecosystem with terrible UX/UI, limited consumer appeal, and almost no emphasis on teaching best practices to protect consumer funds and privacy. Keyhotee was intended to fix these issues by starting as a curated chrome browser extension using an HD Wallet + PGP key generated from the same seed and having tight integration with webmail clients like gmail. One could move to a full featured desktop client via node.js and the mobile space via phonegap. Most importantly, you have a product in front of consumers in a few weeks and they are helping you make it better. That’s called building an ecosystem.  

Bitshares would have been a class of next generation specialized blockchains designed to enable decentralized exchange of any digitized asset- ironically this approach could have worked very well with sidechains. The associated DAC framework I felt was premature, underdeveloped, and also required the more generalized, turing complete framework that Buterin later developed for Ethereum. I don't see how one can claim perfect clarity for how to build autonomous sustainable businesses and then promise specific profits (+5%). When combined with a fundraiser, it seems naïve at best and criminal at worst.      
Honestly, my primary interest in the original Bitshares was the idea of P2P price discovery for cryptocurrencies. Combining this notion with better versions of localbitcoins, one wouldn’t need exchanges for small scale currency swaps allowing mini-satoshi squares to functionally become the ATMS of the developing world. I care very deeply about microfinance and onboarding the unbanked.  

That said, Ethereum does not view itself as a competitor to I3 or its affiliates. We seek to build a comprehensive, open sourced ecosystem that is accessible to all and interoperable with as many standards as possible. The goal here has always been unity and innovation. Focusing on petty personal feuds benefits no one and comes at the expense of time and mental energy.

"Our general answer is the following:

1. If you look at Bitcoin itself, there are many altcoins that are strictly superior to Bitcoin (eg. Litecoin has 4x faster confirmations, Primecoin has 10x faster confirmations and a slight social utility benefit, Datacoin lets you insert data), and yet all of them combined have maybe 15% of the market cap that Bitcoin has. Network effects seem to be pretty powerful, though as I often argue not nearly absolute.

2. The number 29.4% is a complete fabrication. There is an endowment of 0.3x the amount sold (ie. 23.07% of the initial supply), but that's not all for ""us"". The point is to use this slice to support anyone involved in core Ethereum development (and later on not-so-core development), of which one quarter has been distributed to several dozen developers over the past five months but three quarters are still unclaimed. Think of it as an alternative distribution slice for those who don't have powerful CPU/GPUs to mine or money to invest. One of our major challenges is figuring out how to decentralize this distribution mechanism over time. 

3. Unlike the altcoin/Bitcoin case, if anyone comes up with an alt-ethereum, because Ethereum is Turing-complete we can fork the functionality right back into Ethereum proper as a contract, where it will gain the benefit of being able to interface directly with an existing ecosystem of currencies, liquid decentralized exchanges, data feeds, etc.",0,t1_cgs1ive,t3_22ylxq,t3_22ylxq,False,,5,False,Founder,1433348291,1397480564,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,5,,cgs1ive,True,0

"Great article guys.  You are doing beautiful work.  It is so cool watching thoughtful approaches and best practices in an emerging field develop from scratch.

Two advantages you didn't explicitly address: security due to potentially smaller attack surfaces and the general goodness of totally or more fully decentralized implementation.

So many developers these days fall in love with the decentralization ethos of Bitcoin and then what do they do?  They go out and start a state-registered company and build a centralized software service that makes use somehow of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Everybody trots out Mt. Gox as a cautionary example at this point in the discussion, so I may as well pile on.

Of course both of those approaches are perfectly reasonable and likely appropriate depending on the business niche, but the point is we need to look at all angles of a problem and work towards decentralizing them to find better solutions, if they can be made cost effective.

To be sure, developing an ÐApp requires careful attention to the cost of computation and storage on the blockchain and often some of these will more properly belong on some other resource.  But centralized front ends and middleware present rich attack surfaces to dark hat “security consultants” who get paid as much at they can take as they point out flaws in the systems they have chosen to look over.  Putting a front end in the EthBrowser and having the back end blockchain cryptographically integrated presents a very small attack surface compared to web sites hosted at centralized cloud services.

Notice to anyone actually trying to read through the implementation contract: this was coded in one of the languages that Ethereum supports: the Low-level LISP-like Language (LLL).  Please note: low-level.  Contracts can be coded at a much higher level of abstraction in Serpent, and simplified variant of Python.

I reckon a script can only be a contract if at least one person has a 'intrinsic link' a  to it. Afaict,(but is early) it can only be abusive between people if there are at least two persons 'intrinsically linked' to.

There are scripts with one special party, or zero. The drop-box one basically has zero, anyone can put more coin in the tank to keep the data storage going. However if the storage is very important to a particular person... Maybe it *could* be intriniscally linked. It could for instance prove that a blackmailer has incriminating information it could still force a particular person to pay to it.

Whats the status of FOSS/software activist groups trying to affect/do HTTP development? Could there be any way to both be able to cache and have it anonymous?(seems unlikely, but.. crypto is very wtf)

So basically https the private key is at the server, but they mitm it because the certificate authority can say 'this pubkey is good too', and then a intermediate server uses https, and then retransmits with a different privkey. One way around this could be to just start a separate certificate authority? Edit: that wouldnt help, the browser would just tell you it doesnt trust the pubkey, not give you a way around.. You could add another layer of encryption, so then they would have to add another layer of mitm, haha.

Btw should use [Tor](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/), btw. That said, even when using tor-to-clearnet, this would decrease privacy a tiny bit, as the exit node and snoopers beyond it can see more.(darknet is unaffected by this) Of course, it is *much* less efficient for internet traffic. Note: wikipedia mentions https being developped for tor nodes.. I think they mean the *exit* nodes can enter malicious stuff, the intermediate ones can only tell where it came from and where to send it.(But not where the subsequent node will send it)

People already thought of fake searches to decrease tracking.(when i saw it, it was poorly implemented) Fake browsing is also possible. Main problem is how to do all the thing the browser does without showing the user anything, and how to figure out the 'real' links.

"&gt; Why do we need to have enforced rules?

so we can be assured no one is cheating

&gt; What sort of rules?

rules that can be programmed using etherscript

To reiterate: currently, there are no apps that use the identity info in a way that needs to be verifiably enforced.

The gist of what I'm saying is that whenever you need to transfer data between (into) chains, you end up needing to bundle both chain softwares together, else use a trusted source of that chain (you have to trust that data). Having verifiable rules based off that info is not feasible.

The beauty of ethereum is that you can *reuse* applications and *securely link* relationships between them. Once you get data into the ether, you have the assurance not only *that* contract can act on the data, but, if stored, other contracts can, as well. There is no disjoint part. There is no need to rely on trusted queries.

Until we go that route, you'll have every other decentralized app recreating namecoin/human-readable-name-server.",0,t1_cg18qzk,t3_205ubz,t1_cg12f5n,False,,2,False,,1432776801,1394674379,noninono,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cg18qzk,True,0

"Good point. Some contracts may have mechanisms in which payment enters the company that are inherently only via the contract though.

So then you cant just tell the web developer to change the code to avoid the company contract, that hypothetical future browser already decided by the namecoin DNS.

"Hi, this is something that matters to me.

But first, I'm not sure I understand your '50 dollars' comment. It's indeed very likely we'll see native mobile Ethereum clients right out of the gate, either built as reference clients, or based on community projects. These will be free, as I'd expect them to be. For reference, see this potential Objective-c Client project: http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/629/ethereum-objectivec. Android is a no-brainer.

Second, these clients will support any Ethereum Dapps. We're already factoring mobile phone displays for the distributed GUIs powering Ethereum, either as HTML and/or QT packages spread across bitttorrent nodes. On that topic, I encourage you to read this article by our CTO Gavin Wood at http://insightsintoamodernworld.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/apps-what-web-30-looks-like.html. It's very early days, but Gavin will be presenting mockups of this type of interface at our London event on May 9th. Don't think smart contracts, think 'decentralized web'.

Third, an anecdote: Emerging economies tend to skip technology generations. For example, in the Philippines few have landlines, but smart phones are everywhere. In Kenya, by 2009, mobile payments had already been adopted by 40 percent of the adult population, facilitating ~10 percent of the country's GDP. This may not mean much to you, but you should have seen the Billions invested by companies back then in Europe, attempting to push 'mobile payments' as a 'thing'. Project Oscar would like a word, please (http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/project-oscar-mobile-payments)

Finally, and this is my favorite topic, using reputation in place of collaterals. In Europe, when you need a loan, you use your house or car to 'back' the loan so to speak. What about countries where people do not necessarily have such assets? Are they out of luck? Well, in East Africa, Chamas (social groups - thank you John Samson Karanja for introducing me to them) could be a solution. Peers vouch for a group member, literally collateralizing debt with reputation. I'd love nothing more but to see this system operating globally, as opposed to the local communities where it currently strives. 

This is when one realizes that not only emerging economies could benefit from a project such as Ethereum (Somalia, with its absent rule of law, might be a prime candidate), but that actually, our own economies have a thing or two to learn on the topic. Microfinance, decentralized crowdfunding, and peer to peer insurance could indeed be the saving graces of many countries' economies.

"&gt; I mean you're not giving the donors anything. It's pure charity.

Whether or not it's charity depends on whether you plan on being vested in the success of the platform. Say you're an investor and you have 10 BTC to put into ethereum:

Under option A), you give them 10 BTC and they give you some amount of ether that may or may not be overpriced. 

Under option B) you could give, say 5 BTC to the Foundation, then buy 5BTC worth of ether at the market price. Or, give 1BTC to the foundation, then buy 9 btc worth of ether at the market price. Or, give 10 BTC to the foundation, then *don't* buy ether (that's the charity route).

&gt;I don't see why miners should be rewarded but people funding initial development should not.

When you speak of ""reward"" what you're really talking about is profit. If a donor goes with option A and the IPO turns out to be overpriced, they are *guaranteed* to lose money when they sell. It's just bad investing. How can you call option A ""rewarding the donors"" if it maximizes their chance of losing money?

Edit* another way to look at it:

Option A) Place a bet on the foundation's ability to accurately undervalue ether before it's even traded on the market

Option B) Bet on the foundation's ability to build a kick-ass platform. Make your *own* assessment about the long-term value of ether.

"The market price is ultimately going to depend on:
1) Supply vs. Demand: Does demand exceed supply, and does growth of demand exceed inflation.
2) Usefulness of the protocol: Can Ethereum really do what the founders think it can do?
3) Ecosystem: Will people develop awesome apps to take advantage of the protocol?
4) Will transaction fees (payable only in ether) be set at the appropriate level (or float to the appropriate level) so that the protocol isn't too cheap or too expensive to use.

You are using a supply-side argument--that the people generating the ether will just pluck a price out of thin air, which may be cheaper than the presale price. I'm using a demand-side argument--that the price of ether will float based on how demand relates to supply. If this thing is amazing, then demand is likely to severely outstrip supply.

Remember back when Gmail first came out, how revolutionary it was? How everybody wanted one of those coveted beta invites? People were actually selling beta invites--something the ""right people"" could get for free. Why were people paying for something that was designed as a free service? Simple--it was amazing, and they wanted to use it RIGHT NOW rather than in a year, and supply (limited by the number of beta spots) was overwhelmed by demand.

So with ether, there will be a set amount...1.5X...available in the beginning, and then 0.0333 per month after that from mining (total of 0.4X per year).* So...does Ethereum do amazing things which causes an influx of users/speculators to buy up lots of ether in order to use or speculate?

"Her are my counter arguments to you.


So far judging from the responses on all Ethereum forums here is what I see. Most of the people posting on this forum and almost all the people that were at the Miami Conference praising Ethereum are developers. There is genuine potential for this platform to be groundbreaking if done right. The devs that are shilling for the Ethereum to succeed have either been involved in pre-fund raising before and want to see this succeed for selfish reasons or they believe in Ethereum and are planning to monetize this platform in the future and want to see Ethereum succeed for selfish reasons.

Then you have the other half of the devs that are not involved with the project, see there are too many risks involved and fearful of wall street taking over the crypto industry
.
Where I feel there is a severe disconnect is that the majority of opinions on this forum, Reddit, etc.. are developers and they will constitute less that 1% of the total amount of investment capital that Ethereum is trying to raise.

If you go to a Conference where the entire majority of reporters have a dev background, you are basically looking at the very definition of a biased opinion and reporting. Just because a small group of technology advanced individuals are excited about the possibility of the tech, doesn't actually mean equate a great investment.

Then you have the 99% of the general crypto population that are only interested in making a quick profit on this coin. They are not particularly interested in this new coin/platform and don't really care about the technology and only if there will be enough ROI to justify an initial investment into the pre-sale. Initially, there was a lot of hype on this coin that drew a lot of interest, but crypto investors cannot be duped. They realize they are not getting into this investment at the ground floor level and with the amount of money/bitcoin that Ethereum is trying to raise before launch, there will have to be 100 million dollar market cap for them to see a profit. 

Long-term is the only reason to invest. There are few pump and dump scenarios that will work with this investment structure that Ethereum is proposing because all the initial ""pump"" profit is being taken out of the market and into Ethereum's pocket right from the beginning.

Long term I see a lot of risks involved with pre-sale investment.

1/ There is risk of immediate loss of equity once it hits an exchange.

2/ There is risk of dilution

3/ There is risk of the company dissolving or bankrupting (however small) 

4/ There is risk of this becoming vaporware

5/ There is risk that it will be forked and cloned

6/ There is risk that there will be too many security holes

7/ There is risk that a newer and better technology with greater funding and transparency will enter the market in due time

8/ There is risk that the altcoin (or platform if you want to call it that) crypto market will crash in a few years.

9/ There is a risk (and I personally feel strongly about this) that the price will be considerably lower once it hits an exchange and falls to what the market feels is an appropriate price for the amount of risk and dilution involved with the project.

Of course, I could be wrong and Ethereum totally sells out and there will be another 100 million worth of btc bid aftermarket. But do you really think that crypto investors are dying to jump in to give anyone 100 million on vaporware on a diluted investment? ALL you have to look at is the forum boards and ignore the developers who are shilling for the product to succeed. There is a huge outcry against the current investment scheme. Why are people so vehemently against Ethereum's structure? Because they feel it has a possibility to be an asset to the bitcoin community but not the way its currently structured.

So in final words, whether you believe in the tech or not, all you have to ask yourself is this. Would I be better off investing in the pre-sale or should I invest aftermarket?

There is absolutely only ONE reason you should buy into the pre-sale, if you believe that it will be so much oversold and the market will not feel that it's diluted to the point where there is another huge group of buyers willing to take it off your hands and xxx times a return on your investment right from the beginning of launch.

Now I submit to you a few simple reasons why you should wait until aftermarket to buy-in.

1/ You NEGATE any risk mentioned earlier in the post and you only have to consider risk/reward. If I buy in pre-sale what risk do I take vs the reward I will have for taking that risk. Do you think there is greater chance that the market price will be higher than lower from the pre-sale price? And to what degree do you need to see Ethereum trade at to make this pre-sale investment worth it for you.

2/ Time value - What could have I done with this money invested in Ethereum that will be locked up from pre-sale until launch on a legitimate market. During those two or three months, you could have that money invested in Bitcoin (which has a lot less downside and at the current level has a good chance of increasing in value) or a dozen new altcoins that will be launching that as you can see we are in the midst of a crypto coin boom. How much money will you have lost by freezing your money up in Ethereum, when it could be actively invested in other more profitable ventures where the initial investment is not severely diluted?

3/ During the time you buy into the pre-sale (several months) and the time you are able to trade your ETH on an exchange, I guarantee you there will several new teams announcing a new platform or coin that will get much better press with a better investment structure. You take the risk of obsolescence even before the coin launches.

4/ By buying into the coin pre-sale and making it a success you encourage Wall Street to take over the crypto coin market and in the future you may see an environment where every new coin launch will be diluted and structured in a way that only Wall Street will increase their millions and the RISK will all be burdened by the crypto community. Ethereum will set a new precedent and if you think this will not happen, think again. Miners and crypto investors will be locked out of the early ""pump"" profits while Wall Street makes millions and we will take all the RISK. The early pre-sale investors will essentially be the bagholders.

5/ Here is the most important reason to wait until it hits an exchange to buy into Ethereum, you NEGATE all the risk I mentioned before and plus you do not enable this kind of launch in the future. There is a good chance that you will be able to buy it lower than the offering price of approx a dollar an ETH. and if the price rises a bit, you can still buy in at the pre-sale price or a little bit higher. The only reason you should be buying this pre-sale is if you believe that there is another 100 million waiting in line to buy ETH and there is no risk involved. You have absolutely nothing to lose by waiting and a lot at stake by buying and enabling this type of coin pre-sale launch.

Now, over the next few days I imagine Ethereum will hire a Marketing PR, they will hype and pump the tech and coin and gloss it over to make it look like they invented the wheel. They will cast out all the doubters and call them ""FUD."" Vitalik will come online and answer questions about the tech. But I say to you forget about all that. Don't get caught up in the tech, we all know the tech has the potential to be amazing. Look at the investment structure. Dont let Vitalik use excuses like this is the best way to avoid ""whales"" from taking over the market. That is so naive. Think!!! Regardless of the tech, is it more beneficial to me, considering risk vs reward, to buy pre-sale or buy aftermarket?

&gt;Arguing against a pre-mine makes sense if you're talking about nothing more than a fork of bitcoin with slight code modifications. After all, what have you really done to earn a pre-mine? But unfortunately this hardline stance on pre-mine has become a standard meme to unthinkingly repeat. Ethereum is starting from an entirely new codebase. A team had to be organized - all of the code has to be written, tested, and audited. There will be many other costs - legal fees, salaries, etc...

&gt;This isn't a simple fork of an already existing coin - it's an IPO of a project which happens to have a decentralized monetary instrument as part of its product.

&gt;If we applied this ""absolutely no pre-mine"" mentality to anything else it would be apparent that your stance makes no sense - let's use farming for an example.

&gt;If we treated farming the way you're treating the ethereum pre-mine we would expect the farmer to buy the land, hire the workers, plow the fields, plant the seed, grow the plants, harvest the crop, and do any other work necessary. Then, instead of getting any of the harvest for himself, or any discount on the vegetables, you scream ""unfair!"" and demand that the farmer put the entire harvest into a huge pile which you and the farmer and everyone else in the town have an equal chance of getting food from.

&gt;This isn't fair. This isn't logical. This makes no sense. We can't expect that people should do massive amounts of work and then compete on equal footing with those who didn't for a piece of the same pie.


We have big plans, and none of them are ""be greedy"" or ""be thieves"". We're facing complex problems in uncharted territory and attempting to solve them in the most elegant way we possibly can. We're not simply trying to release a coin into the wild - we're attempting to bootstrap an entire ecosystem, and we want to be able to do things for the community that have never been done before. That said - I'm sure mistakes will be made. 

If you would like to be part of the solution then it is not difficult to join that dialogue. But screaming ""thieving liars!"" is not constructive and it does not offer any solutions. You're acting as if we're some secretive organization plotting behind closed doors against you, whose attention you must get by being as loud as possible. That is not the case. We are here - but we are also busy. We are doing our best to organize as quickly as possible and engage the community in a meaningful way. It will take some time, we are doing our best.

"I've said it before here, I'm not sure even Switzerland will be a good enough safe haven, especially if decentralized financial services on top of Ethereum will start disrupting their banks. Iceland might be a better place because they seem both more pro-Internet and anti-corrupt banks, and they're even launching their own AuroraCoin soon.

But what might be even better is having headquarters in at least 2-3 places. Chris Soghoian from ACLU was asked about how companies should protect themselves from the US government before they face a Lavabit-like situation, and he suggeted it might better to have the company located in 2 countries at once, because that way at least the governments of both countries will have to co-operate on shutting you down completely or whatever, and at least there's a chance one of them will disagree.

Also, this doesn't mean you should *hide* from the US government and others. Definitely try to work with them to make them understand, but don't give them the opportunity to easily shut you down if they decide that way.

"*What do you think is the most tangible way that Ethereum could change cryptocurrency?*

Well, I think right now one thing that worries people a lot is Mt. Gox. So there's the question: we've got this decentralised currency that is supposed to make everything trust-free, and yet in the ecosystem we still have centralised trust and that trust just failed us for 400 million dollars. So there's lot of people are talking about this question of can we decentralise more? Can't we make exchanges do less? Can we make exchanges handle just exchanging and not store bitcoins? Can we make Bitcoin wallets that combine the benefits of storing the bitcoins yourself and storing the bitcoins in a centralized way so that you don't have to trust yourself or anyone else. So basically there's a lot of interest into these different kinds of protocols, how they can actually be done. And the way Ethereum's playing into that is just the fact that Ethereum provides a contract system. It creates this mechanism through which anyone can experiment with all these different setups and create different kinds of contracts, pretty much in about 30 seconds. So once people set up any kind of rules that they want, and basically let the best transaction types win. So I'd like to see things like decentralised exchanges exist, I'd like to see things like decentralised financial systems exist, where there is no Mt. Gox at all.

*I'd like to ask just one more question. So is this a shift away from putting trust in an individual, trust in a financial institution, with the trust then being going into the protocols of the system itself, like algorithmic?*

Yes. So any trust that's still there either be in large coalitions of people, so things like 5-out-of-9 voting pools, or the blockchain, or the trust should be in maths.

*So what do you think are the possible effects of quantum computing, and the way that will effect cryptocurrencies and mining in general?*

So in terms of mining, quantum computers are somewhat better at mining, but they can't beat mining completely, so we if quantum computing comes out, all we're going to see is the difficulty a notch up by a few billion and it'll just keep going. The bigger threat is, I would say, from the signature side. So there are quantum-proof signature algorithms to replace ECDSA, but they're all more inefficient in some fashion, and it's a much more untested area of interest. 

*Do you think it'll be some time before quantum computing will provide a bit of a threat to traditional mining?*

Look, the fact is, the most powerful quantum computer in the world managed to use Shor's algorithm to factor the number 21. These things are a joke. It will be a long time before they are successful.

"I think this stuff can be thought about pretty clearly. All this stuff is thought-out, public-key crypto, checksums.. Barring 'true AI' stuff like evolution, or even neural networks is *really* limited compared human thought.

"I believe in the project aswel, from what is see they do a good job. Scripts seem to be the most straightforward and flexible approach. Which i dont seem to see in other new cryptocurrencies.

(as i say too many times :p)Personally i prefer low-level kind of things like escrow between sellers and buyers, bounties, kickstarters, guarantees on donation.(as implied by the other one) Over stuff like hedging. basically not the investment type stuff like hedging, derivatives, issueing stocks.. The other coins seem to be largely about the latter, and it is empathized *some*what here too, but because it is a script i dont have to worry too much about it :)  Maybe i believe too much in stuff like those bounties.

Anyway, this is not easy to pull off... I mean you have to get the block-choice mechanism right,(how PoW/PoS/whatsnew secures the block chain) you want to try get volume.., and there is a lot of freedom in there.. Ethereum promises a decent lightweight client, so that takes some pressure off the volume bit.

Still, particularly volume is a bit of a nag, i mean, i think this shit is cool, but it'd be a bit of a bummer if it becomes big, and the idea only works for large enough ammounts of value so that the price of it actually getting on the block chain is worth it.. Not that scripts are necessarily large, but just in general.. 

(digressing even more)About this, i wonder if multi-blockchain approaches to security are possible. In my conceptualization, PoS miners can basically costlessly mine multiple chains, infact i heard this is an issue because miners dont have incentive not to 'validate' invalid blocks. Dont quite see the problem because full nodes would still ignore the invalid chains, no matter how much longer. I still need to read up on it more, though. Also, transferring coin between chains, at least a bunch of nodes will have to have both chains completely, suspect a client could be full node about some chains and lightweight on others..(also dont know/understand enough about lightweight clients)",0,t1_cfnuk4k,t3_1yttp9,t1_cfnrmub,False,,1,False,,1432544797,1393288159,Jasper1984,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,1,,cfnuk4k,True,0

"The miners will enter into the market but with much less funds slowly over time.

"Looking into it, they use the `.bit` domain, but a browser doesnt defaultly accept it. 

Basically `.bit` is a namespace in which the namespace bought/obtained with namecoin. Each competing 'name allocator' would have a namespace, or a program/sort of thing it lives in. For instance, there is also [Twister](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/1zjm17/twister_a_decentralized_p2p_microblogging_with_a/), which is intended for microblogging.(Probably good initially, but i reckon that is a bit limited scope edit: i mean the scope they took is good to avoid mission creep, but eventually they probably should go beyond what is currently associated with 'microblogging')

So basically different namecoins would probably be intended for different contexts. People might want to different domains namespaces for shops, personal websites, comments, names in games. Possibly games could use it as source of income.

The mechanism of getting and losing could also be different selling points. For instance namesquatters can be a problem, and the particular way it works has effect on incentive.

"I think it would be possible to implement a chess (or checkers) game as a contract where the contract is initiated with the keys for two players, the moves are submitted as transaction, and the winner is verified by the ethereum system. The winner could also be paid a prize via the contract. Still might be considered gambling though although it isn't a game of chance.

I think ""judging"" could also be implemented as an Ethereum contract, like if you have a contest it could be initiated with the public keys of the judges and the contestants, and the judges could submit via transactions and the contract could award itself to the winner.

I think an Ethereum contract could be used to send encrypted communication, it could also used to hold an election, the way American idol uses text message votes, both of which aren't ""games"" but could be done in the context of a game.

I think the most interesting possibility is a game that is fully implemented as an Ethereum contract, or as a series of interlocking contracts. If you have a ""game server"" that holds the world-state of the game, then you can use that as a trusted broker and you don't really need the Ethereum network. Whereas a game that is purely implemented as contracts is totally self contained, and doesn't rely on trust, you can inspect the contract before you play. The only hiccup I see at first blush is that to be Denial Of Service resistant the game would require players to ""pay"" for their moves when they submit them via contract. Once such a game is designed, it would be possible to make a more attractive game client that you run on your system to play the game.

"I don't want to discourage longterm thinking about the DAOogles of the future, but as we are not there just yet, I was hoping to keep one foot on the ground for a moment.  There is great value in thinking about and writing Ethereum contracts that make use of the turing completeness and the crypto primitives to perform complex operations under the watchful gaze of the blockchain.  Still, I think you wave your hands a bit carelessly when you state:
""we no longer care if Alice is a cousin of Bernie, or the devil himself, provided the devil responds to 
incentives and knows how to invest. We don't need to trust them at all."" 
There are of course incentives that live off the blockchain and outside the ethereum economy.  Knowing how to invest is different from executing on that knowledge.  But, if you were not intending to tread on the territory of how meatspace might actually interact with the perfect mathematical crystals of interlocking ethereal contracts, then perhaps I am commenting on the wrong thread.  If by ""investment fund"" you mean some delegation of authority by owners of physical assets to a manager, and the redistribution of real returns from the holding, buying and selling of physical assets, then I think you need to consider the flesh and blood part of the equation.  For example, bringing gold into the ethereum investment universe at some point requires a warehouseman.  She hires guards with big guns to keep the assets safe.  And even though she may issue receipts for that gold in accounts of ethereal splendor, when those guards grow sleepy or are bought off, the value of those receipts will likely drop, suddenly and unhappily.  
Now, I do realize that it is possible to fantasize about a world in which no gold can leave or enter the warehouse without a smart contract insisting on a full accounting, and the weighing machinery itself is protected from false measure by another smart contract tied to a measure judged honest by the consensus of a distributed crowd, etc., etc..  I myself am more interested in what ethereum might be able to do within the sadly flawed world I wake up in each morning.  In this world, delegating portfolio trading authority to Alice IS trusting Alice, and this is a feature of that particular relationship, not a flaw.  I hope other, less rewarding, delegations in day-to-day life can be contracted away.  The ultimate questions are not ""how do we get rid of all trust relationships"" but ""how do we best (most efficiently) move the trust to the activities that are most productive, and make those trusted activities auditable.

It seems to me that if computational power is already a scarce resource, then why would further restrictions be needed? Shouldn't the market be able to price computing cycles on its own? 

Another thing I'm worried about is that two contracts could cost the exact same in terms of computation power but could represent completely different value to their respective users. This could show up in cases where one needs an important contract to be verified in as little a time as possible so that user may be willing to pay more for miners to prioritize it. Conversely, someone who can't afford to have their contract verified within minutes should be able to pay *something* and have it processed within a day or two. A fully market-driven fee structure should accommodate this.

This also affects people in developing countries who may not be able to afford the minimum transaction fee because it's too expensive relative to the value of the services backing it. It would make sense if they could pay a much lower fee and just expect it to take longer to process.

&gt;

&gt;In analytic geometry, an **asymptote** (/ˈæsɪmptoʊt/) of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors. In some contexts, such as algebraic geometry, an asymptote is defined as a line which is tangent to a curve at infinity.

&gt;The word asymptote is derived from the Greek ἀσύμπτωτος (asumptotos) which means ""not falling together,"" from ἀ priv. + σύν ""together"" + πτωτ-ός ""fallen."" The term was introduced by Apollonius of Perga in his work on conic sections, but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.

&gt;There are potentially three kinds of asymptotes: horizontal, vertical and oblique asymptotes. For curves given by the graph of a function y = ƒ(x), horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function appro ...

"&gt; Dr Gavin Wood spent the majority of his talk on Friday arguing against centralisation. He argued for a need for ethereum as a trust-less system.
&gt; What concerns me is that giving an estimated $20 million dollars to the ethereum foundation to help ""fund development"" will actually just centralize development around the ideas the ethereum foundation wants exploring, not what the community wants, another problem with this approach is that we have to put an extremely large amount of trust in the ethereum foundation not to simply run away with everybody's bitcoins.

The Ethereum team wants nothing more than to find a trajectory that aligns both the community-at-large and the core team members with the same economic incentive. If anyone has math/econ models to achieve this, please share them on [our official forums](https://forum.ethereum.org/) so we can arrive at a solution that is win-win for everyone involved :)

&gt; I have not seen any guarantees about how much of the money raised in the IPO will go to fund bounties and what amount will go straight into the founder's pockets.

I'm under the impression that documents related to this will be released before the ether pre-sale. Again, the question is how to align all the incentives just in the right way to ensure different types of projects run in different types of ways. i.e. An academic research group will operate under different constraints than a for-profit venture.

&gt; Most pre mined currencies have been called out as scamcoins in the past, the only difference between them and ethereum is that there is innovation on top of ethereum and it has been claimed the pre mine is for the good of the currency. I have yet to see a successful premine coin.
&gt;This premium is not at all necessary and is harmful. It will reduce the chance of mainstream adoption of ethereum. Throughout the currencies future, there will be criticism that it is just a pyramid scheme, more so than for bitcoin, especially due to the ""early adopter discount"".

First and foremost, Ethereum is producing actual technology. You can download proof-of-concept builds that interoperate on a testnet from https://code.ethereum.org, which is regularly updated with builds in both C++ and Go for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can mine (on testnet), send gas/ether to other accounts, even create contracts and execute them. People are so excited about the possibilities that platforms and tools are already working on top of the testnet. If you want more info, #ethereum-dev on Freenode is probably a good place to jump in

&gt; Ethereum represents a potentially great idea. I urge the ethereum foundation to reconsider the premine. You are risking the currencies future for short term financial rewards. Please consider adopting the distribution model of æthereum. You could develop your proof of stake algorithm, slasher, to create a currency which does not have the waste of mining. It is my belief that without your support, æthereum will be forgotten, and without your acceptance of æthereum's ideas, ethereum will fail like every other premium currency. Please make this the future, instead of another get rich quick scheme.

If you were to take a straw poll of the main team (including all support roles, not just devs), I think you'd find that the vast majority are **BY FAR** more concerned about the health of the Ethereum ~~community~~ ecosystem than any amount of cash. The unfortunately reality is that many of us have been working on Ethereum for nearly 6 months without so much as a single satoshi in payment. Some of us have families &amp; mortgages and have had to take loans to pay the bills while we clarify all the complications of launching world-impacting technology with geographically-distributed team members on a shoestring budget.

I hope the community can evaluate us on our actions. Scammers would have ""launched"" &amp; disappeared long ago. Instead, we're building alliances with partners all throughout the world, including 40+ self-organized meetups and dozens of developers contributing to MIT-licensed projects. We're doing our best to make it to conferences to speak, explain, and mix ideas with others all while sleeping on the floor, working 18 hour days, and spending our own savings to make sure the technology marches forward, payday be damned. ;)

"Ethereum has two languages, E-CLL (the language people write in) and ES (the language that contracts execute); I'll answer the question for both separately.

E-CLL is a proof of concept. Right now, it's basically a subset of Python, with the exception that integers are modulo 256. Ultimately, I hope that it gets expanded to cover all of pure Python, and other languages are written that

ES has a few specific requirements:

(i) High level of deduplication. We are in a unique situation where thousands of people's code is stored in a common database where we can choose the format, and we should take advantage of that. Ultimately, I want to erase the distinction between functions, code-blocks and libraries.
(ii) Simplicity. The fewer ops the better.
(iii) Optimization-friendliness.

The question is, what is the right tool for the job?

There are 4 main solutions to the problem:

1. Assembly-like language with jumps
2. Postscript-like language with concatenation and functions
3. Lisp-like language with functions and recursion
4. Some moderately simple language that actual humans code in, like Lua

Ethereum 0.0.1, as old-timers might recall, was purely (1). Then, on the advice of Andrew Miller, Paul Snow and others, I switched to stack-based, but still with jumps. Now, we are looking at something similar to (2). You might notice that ES2 is actually almost exactly like Postscript, except that we are using hashes-as-pointers as a possible alternative to including lists directly and we don't have arrays, dicts, variables or first-class functions. However, Gav Wood's criticism of (2) is that it's imposing a preference for a certain set of control structures (IFELSE, WHILE, function calling) by fiat, whereas a jump-based approach lets the compiler create whatever control structures it wants.

(3) is interesting and highly elegant, primarily because Lisp is designed to be extensible so it might be possible to use an existing Lisp interpreter (although that might also be problematic, since we do heavily rely on 20-32 byte strings and ints and all existing machines are 4-byte or 8-byte). I also like the Lisp approach from a philosophical standpoint, in that it has a very high level of simplicity by reducing everything to functions - an interesting parallel to the assembly approach of reducing everything to jumps. However, my main qualm with Lisp is that Lisp is fundamentally a functional language designed around immutable data structures, and Ethereum is fundamentally a state machine. 

(4) is a bad idea, since humans' coding preferences change. Sure, we can pick a language that people like coding in now. But 10 years down the line, people might invent some completely new paradigm, and we would end up with people writing compilers down to Lua - a much more shaky and untested field than compiling down to register-assembly, or stack, or even Lisp. 

Ultimately, I think the optimal ES design should be decided on based on what the actual applications are that people want to use. We have a person trying to implement a clearinghouse, as well as many other applications, and we'll see how the language can be tweaked to make such applications work better.",0,t1_cf77k0m,t3_1x0ebg,t3_1x0ebg,False,,7,False,Founder,1432254960,1391559453,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cf77k0m,True,0

"I agree with some of the article..

But dont confuse anti-pointing cameras and microphones -attached to insecure devices, developped by google. In a context where leaks have indicated the NSA taps everything and is in looking into mass-compromising machines with anti tech sentiment.

Doing so gives the impression for a complete lack of concern for it. Worse, some parties may try spread this sentiment, and then your associated with them. That said, the microphones are just as bad.. But i am glad to see a sign of a line being drawn somewhere.

Yes, i have worries how security relates to ethereum, btw. We can hope that mass-compromising machines is hard. We can get specially secured machines for these things, i mean it is near hopeless for regular users, to be frank. There are cheap computers that could be used. There are even various schemes where you use multiple computers.. 

For instance you could have two, plus a small one with a display. The first one talks to the internet and can send data to the second. The second can read that data and you read your emails/browsing there. However you cannot easily follow links, instead if you want to follow a link, it sends it to the tiny computer with display. The display shows what link you followed, and you have to press a button to allow the link to be passed on to the internet-connected computer.

For ethereum/bitcoin transactions, the same would happen, except you'd see the transaction on the display.

(mind that [security can involve hardware](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Radio-Transmitter/))

Think that the third option misrepresents UBI... I mean the point is that there are no strings attached.. And why would there suddenly be a committee..

That said, well, lets say there was UBI and few jobs.. You dont want people to become potatoes. Maybe you need to put in a little stick to make people go out and do things..

About the mesh net.. Donts see how it is supposed to work well across longer distances. Frankly the solution is to use the regular net.. Still like that people are working on meshnets though.

"Unfortunately I'm not aware of any video's but here would be my own personal thoughts on your performance:

* You are comfortable in front of an audience (that is huge, not many people are).
* For the most part you covered the material by addressing the audience directly, and used the slides only as reference (this is good).
* When you didn't know the answer to something you admitted it with good humor.

---

Areas of improvement:

* You tried to cover too much material too quickly and too abstractly. Use concrete examples (Bob and Alice type examples for instance). Smart Contracts are a difficult concept to get across, but are the root of what makes Ethereum exciting. I'd drop the colored coins section entirely and focus on the contracts.

* Obviously the room conditions sucked. I think I overheard one of the audience members offer to drive the presentation software for you. I think holding the laptop in your hand was distracting both for you and the audience. If you have a podium, it isn't a big deal but in those conditions it is probably best to rope one of the audience members into driving the laptop.

--

Overall I think you gave a credible presentation, and what you need more than anything is simply a bit more practice with doing presentations in general. I'd highly recommend looking into joining something like Toastmasters.

Best of luck! :)

P.S. I'd also hint to your videographer that focusing on audience member's laptop screens is kinda creepy.

"Why would you donate bitcoins, if you need them later to purchase ethereum.

I think if you view it from a capital allocation model, you would need to rely on a very efficient group think to allocate enough bitcoin to get ethereum rolling, but then have enough capital leftoever to realize a investment in ethereum when it goes live, and that this scenario vs a premine IPO would provide a better return.

Also what happens when the donation drive fails, then ethereum has to come back with the IPO model.

I think the IPO model should go forward, I would like to see a better understanding of how the bitcoin raised gets spent, and also how the ethereum gets allocated.  My issue isnt the premine, its that they are getting BTC upfront, and they are getting ethereum pre allocated to special parterns and early angels. Which means I am funding ethereum with my bitcoin but I getting diluted by other insiders, when we are taking the exact same risks at such an early stage. Unless I am mistaken.

Much more disclosure needs to happen, also I am concerned that no-one in the team has any experience handling or managing large project money or organizations.   Funding 5-10-20 million is no small sum without a some business management experience.

"&gt; Can we just use Bitcoin instead of Torcoin? Isn’t money supposed to be fungible to all use cases? Perhaps not – Bitcoin’s transaction speed is too slow for a dynamic network allocating bandwidth – 10 to 60 minutes is far too long to negotiate with a relay. And payments have to be anonymous. So a fast-clearing (Fastcoin can clear a block in 12 seconds), fully anonymous (likeZerocoin) variant is needed.

You can use a system where a request only has a probability of winning a small amount, instead of always getting an absolutely miniscule amount. The amount has to be small, otherwise unlucky people get hit too hard.

This probability can presumably be simply based on block hashes, although i am [aware potential miner collusion](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/2758/#Comment_2758). Basically, only psuedorandom number agreed on indicates so, the 'provider' gets paid, and only then he has an incentive to try it on the actual blockchain.

It has to be DDOS proof though. Essentially, I suggested it before with servers and viewers. 'Viewers' have scripts they fund and pay out. Accessing servers you send messages that can also be used on the script, within a time-frame.

The 'request' message to servers can also be used by servers to punish viewers, by destroying coin on the script, but also on the side of the server.(cant cheaply destroy viewer coin)

The 'data accepted' message give the server a probability he will be able to get a payout from the script. The ability of the request to punish is used as discentive against viewers not sending coin.

To the above, speed is nearly irrelevant. The time frame can be days.

One attack is a viewer viewing stuff, and then playing both viewer and server to drain his account in the script. I reckon a solution is to have a minimum amount for it to work. No-one can extract more than that from the script.

Then viewers attacking that way, *can*, but the servers see it and blacklist that script. The script is subsequently useless, but still has the attackers viewers money in it, making the attack expensive.

A lesser solution is having lists of trusted servers in the script, and scripts can accept *if* they trust those servers.

 Edit: The above was conceived with just using ether as payment.. Doesnt contain any aspect of paying the developpers. The amount paid is unsure, one way is to just let viewers decide, and get rejected if they go too low. Dont see how you could connect it to a sub-coin, afaik, really i feel you kindah shouldnt.

"Conference, Alpha Testnet and Fundraiser Updates

January 29, 2014 - By Team

Ethereum received an incredible response at the Miami Bitcoin Conference. We traveled there anticipating many technical questions as well as a philosophical discussion about the purpose of Ethereum; however, the overwhelming amount of interest and enthusiasm for the project was much larger than we had anticipated. Vitalik’s presentation was met with both a standing ovation and a question queue that took hours to address.

Because we intend on providing an equal opportunity to all those who want to be involved, and are reviewing the relevant logistical and regulatory issues for a fundraiser of this scale, we have decided to postpone the Feb 1 launch of the fundraiser. We will make the announcement of the new fundraiser launch date on our official website: Ethereum.org.

The Ethereum project is also excited to announce the alpha release of the open source testnet client to the community at the beginning of February. This will give people an opportunity to get involved with the project and experiment with Ethereum scripts and contracts, and gain a better understanding of the technical properties of the Ethereum platform. Launching the testnet at this date will give those interested in the fundraiser a chance to better understand what the Ethereum project is about before participating.

The testnet will include full support for sending and receiving transactions, the initial version of the scripting language as described in our whitepaper, and may or may not include mining. This will also be the first major cryptocurrency project to have two official clients released at the same time, with one written in C++ and the other in Go; a Python client is also in the works. A compiler from the Ethereum CLL to Ethereum script will be released very soon.

A note on security

The fundraiser will NOT be launching on February 1st and any attempt to collect funds at this time should be considered a scam. There have been some scams in the forums thus please use caution and only consider information posted on Ethereum.org to be legitimate. It is important to reinforce to all that only information released and posted at Ethereum.org should be trusted as many are likely to impersonate us.",0,t1_cf25h58,t3_1whkj8,t1_cf24kbv,False,,7,False,,1432165140,1391033124,ddink7,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cf25h58,True,0
"That are two good points, and I very much agree with the decentralization problem within the eco system. We have a beautiful, decentralized Bitcoin network, but the services, products, startups, etc. defining the eco system are almost always built way too centralized—which is fundamentally the opposite of the original idea. 

LLL was chosen since it's Dennis primary weapon and I'm a huge fan of Lisp in general. And a functional programming language feels like a natural fit for me to write an Ethereum contract.

"The miners will enter into the market but with much less funds slowly over time. And the Investor could sell a few for a high price, the demand will be very high if too many people get locked out of the IPO. Its not only that extreme case, if 3 or 5 ""big players"" will buy in the IPO can be finished in 1 minute. I would hate to not be able to buy in because the servers can not handle so much requests and then the IPO is closed because the cap is reached.
But beside that I think for the future development that power concentration would be very bad. The ether funds of the founders are time-locked so they cannot influence the market, the miners will need much time to create funds and if supply is too low the price will skyrocket, driving more people into mining and makes investment in mining very high, so the price and mining cost will be in an equilibrium. If the monopolistic investor decide one day to cash out the miners will suffer a lot from a price crash and the whole ethereum project could be attacked in such a way. I dont say that it is very realistic but it is a threat and should be provented.

"Conference, Alpha Testnet and Fundraiser Updates

January 29, 2014 - By Team

Ethereum received an incredible response at the Miami Bitcoin Conference. We traveled there anticipating many technical questions as well as a philosophical discussion about the purpose of Ethereum; however, the overwhelming amount of interest and enthusiasm for the project was much larger than we had anticipated. Vitalik’s presentation was met with both a standing ovation and a question queue that took hours to address.

Because we intend on providing an equal opportunity to all those who want to be involved, and are reviewing the relevant logistical and regulatory issues for a fundraiser of this scale, we have decided to postpone the Feb 1 launch of the fundraiser. We will make the announcement of the new fundraiser launch date on our official website: Ethereum.org.

The Ethereum project is also excited to announce the alpha release of the open source testnet client to the community at the beginning of February. This will give people an opportunity to get involved with the project and experiment with Ethereum scripts and contracts, and gain a better understanding of the technical properties of the Ethereum platform. Launching the testnet at this date will give those interested in the fundraiser a chance to better understand what the Ethereum project is about before participating.

The testnet will include full support for sending and receiving transactions, the initial version of the scripting language as described in our whitepaper, and may or may not include mining. This will also be the first major cryptocurrency project to have two official clients released at the same time, with one written in C++ and the other in Go; a Python client is also in the works. A compiler from the Ethereum CLL to Ethereum script will be released very soon.

A note on security

The fundraiser will NOT be launching on February 1st and any attempt to collect funds at this time should be considered a scam.

Absolutely false IMO.

Meanwhile, in Ethereum, I specifically forced the project to have an infinitely growing currency supply so there is no such thing as ""25% of all currency units that will ever exist"" in the first place.

I think that making distribution models that are ""technically fair"" is a futile task; the best approach is to look at how we can create a distribution model that is as widely dispersed as possible, and that necessarily involves delivering currency units to multiple constituencies.

"I'm not involved with Ethereum so I can't answer for what will be there from the start, apart from saying that things which can not be currently done, will not be in Ethereum from the start :p 

Now, there is several issues at hand here though. One is to keep keys and password secure attackers that might steal the resources they protect, another is ensure a computation has been executed correctly. 

My current understanding, hope vbuterin will correct me if I say something wrong here, is that Ethereum scripts will be executed by the miners, which ensure they will be executed correctly. Now once you have obfuscation, you could add obfuscated code to the blockchain, or maybe even external services like Maidsafe, which an Ethereum script might then tell someone to execute. So basically, once obfuscation technology matures,  if you want to upload a script to the blockchain, you run it through an obfuscator first, then upload the obfuscated script. The obfuscator just would be a local program that you would run on your computer, so Ethereum itself doesn't really need any special support for this. 

I have some related questions myself that perhaps someone knows the answer to?

What are the plans regarding IO operations in scripts? Allowing a script to make an arbitrary network connection opens many possibilities, but has a lot of security issues. As I understand in, the current version is Turing-complete, but when it comes to IO, its mainly just that a contract can store some data in the block chain.

"Presenter here.  The funder acceptance test (FAT) was half-baked.  The funders probably won't know the profit margin of the entrepreneur.  Instead of returning profit they could demand a multiple of the prize as the non-performance penalty.

The issue of gaming the FAT was discussed in the Q&amp;A where the project initiator funds more than half as a disguised donor in an effort to do nothing and rubberstamp the FAT.  The FAT can be gamed, but payoff to the scammer is less than an assurance contract without FAT.

It's also pretty obvious to me that excludable public goods, like a bridge with tolls for non-funders incentivizes better than pure public goods.  Also I prefer the escrow model, with perhaps some way of investing the funds during the campaign to offset opportunity costs.  Under the pledge system no opportunity cost is incurred but one must be sure that all donors honor their pledges (trustful).

However, i cant help but wonder, in PoS, staking('mining') alternative blocks comes at no cost, there is another side to that aswel; you can have many chains... And afaics Slashers system of avoiding people pushing incorrect blocks would still work, excepting the time-interval thing.

And pure PoS systems have to deal with the time-interval issue somehow too, and if just one of the chains uses PoW, they can lockstep all the other chains with that, i reckon..

(Of course with PoW, multiple chains would divide work(hashing) power, and it would be easier to put the attack onto one chain. Rewarding the more difficult mining more would only change the tactic of the attacker towards trying to move around the difficulty until he ends up with the most work-power in a block.)

Section 2. [**Trust metric**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato#Trust_metric) of article  [**Advogato**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato): 

---

&gt;The motivating idea for Advogato was to try out in practice Levien's ideas about attack resistant [trust metrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_metric), having users certify each other in a kind of [peer review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) process and use this information to avoid the abuses that plague open community sites. Levien observed that his notion of attack resistant trust metric was fundamentally very similar to the [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm used by [Google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) to rate article interest. In the case of Advogato, the trust metric is designed to include all individuals who could reasonably be considered members of the Free Software and Open Source communities while excluding others.

Your question though is v. difficult to answer, and TBH, I'm reduced to hunches when trying. But fuck it, this is reddit... Partly because I'm a modernist of a sort. I think cryptocurrencies are a reactionary element of a wider more interesting project worth putting a political wager on (a definition of what this wider project this is exactly defies my articulation—cryptopolitics? Open-source organisation?). Perhaps cryptocurrencies, in liquifying the rancid foundations of state-bank apparatuses, are a necessary stage towards something more radical. I won't lie, I'd like to see everything dialectically flipped: crypto-*un*-currencies, automation of market-bypassed production, relentless social use-need matching... Ethereum, to my knowledge, seems to be the only project that verges toward this side of the wider project, in demonstrating that it takes the trouble of devising a Turing-complete language, emphasising the architecture (potentiality) over unimaginative applications (actuality) of the blockchain, and attempting to define smart-contracts/DAOs—however problematical. It's a material fact that ever more sophisticated forms of automation or smart-contracts now exist, and all we can say for certain is that it's “for better or worse”, yet by the same token, present itself as an opportunity, in *resembling* a project with traction on social formations to come. This is already significant even without having achieved anything, because its practice is to build consequentially. The present is saturated with exhausted, inconsequential organisation; some remain popular simply because they feel-good in their overt impotence and symbolism (#Occupy, Indignados, Democracia real ya, Pussy Riot, Voina...); others because they're integral to hegemony and facilitate corruption (trade unions, parliamentarians, ""radical"" opposition parties...).

The goal isn't to use a decentralized identity to grant access to a centralized website. That only is going halfway.

To really be 'solved' in my mind, I need to be able to use my decentralized identity to verify access to decentralized infrastructure. 

Ex: I don't want to use WhatsApp(rely on centralized infrastructure), I want to message p2p(rely on my own or decentralized infrastructure).

If its possible using namecoin, great. My intuition is that its much easier to accomplish on ethereum, as contracts have access to the storage to other contracts. Thus, you can define an 'identity' as a network of modularly linked persona contracts(contracts only editable by one address) and services (also contracts).

The fact that these services(infrastructure) are contracts also means that they can be forked at will.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

I'm not sure what you mean. I was suggesting it in the vein that if the fundraiser model went forward I was thinking of putting in something like $200. However, if it was donations they were seeking, I'd put in $100, even if I wasn't getting any ether or return back. That's more money for the devs that they can use however they want.

&gt; Also what happens when the donation drive fails, then ethereum has to come back with the IPO model.

Very valid. I framed it that way but another thing is if you felt confident enough with the donation scheme you could just rely on that and not even have the fallback.

But it could just be a way to test the waters. Some Kickstarters (not technically donations) raise hundreds of thousands or millions more than expected.

"&gt; Decentralized contract protocols like Ethereum have already technically robbed sovereign power of its usefulness in the regulation of financial matters

Really? Because countries are already regulating Bitcoin and it would take one push from some powerful lobbyists for the US to ban cryptos and the for the experiment to all but end. Not to mention, the a lot of fiat -&gt; crypto in the US and other countries is entirely regulated due to regulations sites like Coinbase have to follow.

You also need to think about where you are going with this. Because direct democracy and decentralized corporations sound great on paper but in practice will have some flaws. We could imagine some scenario where national borders are all but eliminated and what remains are decentralized organizations. What drives those organizations? Anonymous stockholders with no loyalty to nationalities? Will we see race to the bottoms with horrible working conditions, rampant pollution (who cares if your neighbor has smog if you don't have it), etc because all that drives it is profit?

Decentralization is good, but be careful what you wish for. You should also keep in mind that some people have a very strong desire and reason for power to stay centralized.

Ethereum is just a platform on which to build distributed applications.  You may as well be asking why would the layman ever use a computer because you have to be an expert to understand the microarchitecture of the CPU.

I thought I read that this is being considered.  Anyway, this is matter of balancing the incentives of miners, users, early adopters, late adopters, and investors.  It is a tricky problem to get right, but it doesn't really matter too much in terms of technology.

&gt; What is the function of ether being divisible to 18 decimal places?

I am not an ethereum dev, but my guess is that since integers are 256 bits anyway, adding the extra precision has no drawbacks.  I agree that it is a bit crazy, but you have to draw the line somewhere and it is better to have too much precision than too little.  Again, it is rather arbitrary.

I think one problem is the conflation of the mechanism to reward developers and the the mechanism to control contract execution. The success of ethereum depends on the ability to deploy and execute novel kinds of contracts - i.e. it will work best if there is a low barrier to deploying contracts = low value ether. Whereas using ether as a reward depends on it having a high value.

"What I meant by ""untraceable bitcoin"" means that once you invest and send them your btc you will have no recourse to prove where the money went and who received them.  I thought that was obvious. You do understand the only reason they are asking for bitcoins rather than fiat is to skirt the law and fall into a gray area to avoid crowdfundraising laws,  I am sure the amount of equivalent money they are requesting in bitcoins is at this very moment attracting attention from the FEDS SEC and Canadian agencies, this amount of capital will not be overlooked.  The transfer and exchange of coins to ultimately cash them into USD to avoid regulatory laws is the very definition of ""money laundering.""   This will not end well, but if the agencies arrest these guys, how are they going to recover your money, they are in ""untraceable bitcoins."" All investors will be out of luck.

And you are right. I highly doubt that they will even get close to the amount that they are requesting in bitcoins, which means they will do a massive dump aftermarket to honor the prior commitments they have made.  All early investors will be at risk sending their btc and getting them seized plus the extra risk that the coins will be overpriced immediately aftermarket.  Why take that risk?  If you like the tech just buy aftermarket, it will be flooded with these coins at a much lower cost than one dollar a coin.

"&gt; In a traditional investment, if the founders take more capital, they usually get diluted more.

I think the right way of thinking about this is as if it's an auction. From a monetary standpoint, what we're doing is economically equivalent to (1) auctioning off 1000 ether, (2) giving 250 to the org and (3) giving 250 to ourselves. The more people bid on those 1000, the higher the price goes. The only difference is that instead of giving out 1000/250/250, we're giving out X/0.25X/0.25X where X scales with the investment so as to keep the price predictable.

&gt; This could be unhealthy long term as a bunch on guys will become rich on paper overnight without any product yet, but just an idea.

The founders are locked in for a year. So we could get rich on paper overnight, but we cannot get rich in reality unless Ethereum maintains its value for an entire year. If not, then our wealth would go up and then crash right back down before we have any chance at all to spend it.

There is one major material difference between MSC and Ethereum. The MSC fundraiser took place in a semi-obscure forum thread, and very little media attention was given to it while it was still in progress. Only after the fundraiser was over was there serious media attention. With Ethereum, on the other hand, we are semi-mainstream already, and will be pushing hard to get attention throughout the fundraiser through various mainstream media sources to give everyone a chance to participate. BTC had zero premine, but Satoshi got his 0.25X from an entire year of obscurity. QRK also had zero premine, but I believe the community was adept at seeing through their de facto premine through obscurity strategy.

This way the whole network could improve its speed, not just for the paid users.

Obviously, now the criticism will come from the paying users, who can say ""why would I subsidize the freeloaders?"".

"The miners will enter into the market but with much less funds slowly over time.

Its not only that extreme case, if 3 or 5 ""big players"" will buy in the IPO can be finished in 1 minute.

But beside that I think for the future development that power concentration would be very bad. The ether funds of the founders are time-locked so they cannot influence the market, the miners will need much time to create funds and if supply is too low the price will skyrocket, driving more people into mining and makes investment in mining very high, so the price and mining cost will be in an equilibrium. If the monopolistic investor decide one day to cash out the miners will suffer a lot from a price crash and the whole ethereum project could be attacked in such a way.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

"&gt; Trusting ethereum contracts.

Ethereum is just a platform on which to build distributed applications.  You may as well be asking why would the layman ever use a computer because you have to be an expert to understand the microarchitecture of the CPU.  

&gt; Is ether destroyed?

I thought I read that this is being considered.  Anyway, this is matter of balancing the incentives of miners, users, early adopters, late adopters, and investors.  It is a tricky problem to get right, but it doesn't really matter too much in terms of technology.

&gt; What is the function of ether being divisible to 18 decimal places?

I am not an ethereum dev, but my guess is that since integers are 256 bits anyway, adding the extra precision has no drawbacks.  I agree that it is a bit crazy, but you have to draw the line somewhere and it is better to have too much precision than too little.  Again, it is rather arbitrary.

&gt; Is ethereum an oxymoron?

Oxymoron: ""a figure of speech in which apparently contradictory terms appear in conjunction""  

The meaning of this question escapes me.   What ""multiple distributed block chains are you talking about?  What technology are you proposing?

"Your comparison with Satoshi really isn't fair. Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem and brought a completely novel concept to widespread adoption, single-handedly. And even after all that, Satoshi doesn't seem to have spent any coin on himself, after all these years! If Satoshi ever spends his coin, I am sure he will spend the bulk of it for the good of humanity, rather than buying for himself mega-islands/yachts/planes/etc.

If Satoshi had baked into the protocol that even before mining, after 5 years he would get 43% of the bitcoins, you can bet bitcoin adoption wouldn't have been near as big as it was. And I'm sure someone would have forked it to make a fairer bitcoin, which would have grown more popular.

Now compare that with Ethereum. The team has 47 (!) people, is not nearly as big an incremental advance, and has competition already in the form of ColoredCoins, Counterparty, MasterCoin, etc. Granted the scripting idea seems the most advanced I have seen, but that doesn't mean it can't be implemented by others.

"Conference, Alpha Testnet and Fundraiser Updates

January 29, 2014 - By Team

Ethereum received an incredible response at the Miami Bitcoin Conference. We traveled there anticipating many technical questions as well as a philosophical discussion about the purpose of Ethereum; however, the overwhelming amount of interest and enthusiasm for the project was much larger than we had anticipated. Vitalik’s presentation was met with both a standing ovation and a question queue that took hours to address.

Because we intend on providing an equal opportunity to all those who want to be involved, and are reviewing the relevant logistical and regulatory issues for a fundraiser of this scale, we have decided to postpone the Feb 1 launch of the fundraiser. We will make the announcement of the new fundraiser launch date on our official website: Ethereum.org.

The Ethereum project is also excited to announce the alpha release of the open source testnet client to the community at the beginning of February. This will give people an opportunity to get involved with the project and experiment with Ethereum scripts and contracts, and gain a better understanding of the technical properties of the Ethereum platform. Launching the testnet at this date will give those interested in the fundraiser a chance to better understand what the Ethereum project is about before participating.

The testnet will include full support for sending and receiving transactions, the initial version of the scripting language as described in our whitepaper, and may or may not include mining. This will also be the first major cryptocurrency project to have two official clients released at the same time, with one written in C++ and the other in Go; a Python client is also in the works. A compiler from the Ethereum CLL to Ethereum script will be released very soon.

A note on security

The fundraiser will NOT be launching on February 1st and any attempt to collect funds at this time should be considered a scam.

Imagine a scenario where this Algorithm is enshrined in an Ethereum contract, and drives a DAC. This is what's coming in the very near future.

One question arises, however: in the case of the VC firm, their algorithm is presumably a closely-guarded bit of intellectual property. It provides a competitive advantage that the firm would not want to relinquish.

In the open-source land of Ethereum, there's nothing to prevent anyone from copying an algorithm and using it for their own benefit. So how might DAC operators cope with this challenge?

Perhaps the Algorithm itself could be hosted off-chain, where its code doesn't necessarily have to be visible to all. Perhaps there's simply an understanding that investing in the DAC will provide an opportunity to profit from the Algorithm - even though its inner workings aren't visible.

"Let's say they raise 1 thousand bitcoins in the ""IPO"". That means they'll give 1 million ethers to the backers and create 300 thousand for the Ethereum Foundation and release the Genesis block and kickstart the protocol. They protocol will be hardwire to create 400 thousand ethers by year, every year.

So before any mining, there's 1.3 million ethers around. The foundation owns therefore 23% of all ether. After a year of mining, the miners will have added another 400k, getting the total to 1.7 million ethers. The foundation's original 300k now represent 17% of the total. The amount held by the backers and foundation stays the same, but it becomes proportionally smaller every year.

Does this means that the total supply will grow indefinitely? Yes and no. Theoretically yes, at a constant rate which will represent a smaller and smaller % of the total.  But in practice some coins are always lost, going in hard drives in dumpsters, burned paper wallets, forgotten keys and more specifically to Ether, badly coded contracts and unexpected conditions that might lock coins forever. Let's say that every year, 1% of all ether is lost in those situations. This means that after 100 years, when there will be 40 million ethers in the network, 400 thousand of those will be lost in average, and 400k will be created by miners, so an equilibrium will have been reached and the supply will be constant.

"&gt; really fast

That's kind of a non-feature for Ethereum, as most scripts will be *very* simple.

&gt; easy to sandbox

I'm not terribly familiar with ""vanilla"" Lua nor LuaJIT, but have they been security audited for sandboxing? That's something *very* difficult to get right.

&gt; Is there a technical reason this can't happen or is it a preference? I struggle to see the point in reinventing the wheel, spending time implementing an interpreter, compiler, eventual machine code compiler, etc, when you have all of this already available and time could be devoted elsewhere.

The simplest reason I can think of is script compactness, Lua opcodes aren't necessarily designed for compactness (well of course they were to a degree, but that was only one of many considerations made when designing Lua's opcodes, actually don't Lua and LuaJIT use different opcodes?) Note that I'm not particularly convinced that the Ethereum team has done a great job of optimizing for space either, they're using a very straightforward bytecode.

Security in regards to bytecode is also important, a simple bytecode which only has a handful of instructions, with simple implementations is a lot easier to perform a security audit on than the (relatively) large Lua or LuaJIT implementations. Note that securing JITed code is even more difficult.

&gt; I know that vitalik made the argument that you don't want to be tied to a single language if we see some crazy changes in language design in the next 10-20 years, but can you future proof opcodes or an interpreter any more than you could a language?

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain). So note that nTransactions and nBlocks is going to be at least linear in time (just like Bitcoin) but the contract memory requirements (the most radical change in scalability characteristics from Bitcoin) is proportional to the number of contracts but does not necessarily continually grow over time. (If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

That is PoW(Proof of Work), btw, PoS(Proof of Stake) to which 'power' is distributed by ownership of ether has more incentive to include blocks.. As i understand it is going to be a PoW/PoS mix.

I think ""judging"" could also be implemented as an Ethereum contract, like if you have a contest it could be initiated with the public keys of the judges and the contestants, and the judges could submit via transactions and the contract could award itself to the winner.

I think an Ethereum contract could be used to send encrypted communication, it could also used to hold an election, the way American idol uses text message votes, both of which aren't ""games"" but could be done in the context of a game.

I think the most interesting possibility is a game that is fully implemented as an Ethereum contract, or as a series of interlocking contracts.

"Dan, it was great talking to you and hearing your questions at the meetup.  I was the guy asking about accessing external contracts, adding comments to code, and ethereum run/burn estimates for contract authors.

I think you have the public fund scenario all worked out.  The private fund is difficult as mentioned due to the current difficulty obsfucating anything in the contract, be it private key or anything else.

One possibility would be for the private fund transactions Alice performs to be off-chain using Open Transactions.  OT is essentially a trustless notary that signs receipts (uses triple entry accounting).  A balance is simply the last signed receipt.  You can also do Chaumian anonymous cash transactions.  Smart contracts can also be run within OT using Chaiscript.  It's also suitable for medium/high frequency trading, whereas a decentralized blockchain market isn't.  So maybe Bob and/or Charlie send a transaction denoting how much ether (or E subcurrency) they want to invest, and it's stored in Alice's contract.

So the magic trick is to have this investment ether or E subcurrency (signed by A, B &amp; C?) bailed out of the ethereum contract to buy etherfund tokens on an OT server.  So maybe self.issuePurchasingTransaction(securityToTrade, amountToTrade, self.privateKey) sends ether to an OT server controlled Ethereum address in exchange for etherfund tokens sent to an off-chain OT wallet that Alice controls.  These are not ether tokens, but rather etherfund tokens because they are backed by a multisig balance.  The OT etherfund tokens can then be used to trade for other OT tokens on the OT server (either anonymous cash OT instruments or others).  Just a thought, I think there are a few big holes in it.  Like maybe the 3 private keys for the OT etherfund token would need to be time lock/released in an OT smartcontract or else the counterparty on the OT side would never get his unencumbered ether.  Or maybe after Alice trades off-chain, Alice, Bob and Charlie will need to sign transactions sending ether to OT controlled ethereum address(es) for the OT trades to be finalized (releasing encumbered funds to counterparty).  In this scenario, Bob and Charlie really have no idea what Alice bought, thereby keeping the secret sauce secret.

If you need to buy real stock, you could look at making automated ether/BTC/USD exchange and then make API calls to robinhood.io buy real stock in the future (Q3?).  Bit of a regulation nightmare that.

Vitalik said that devs are working on integrating OT with Ethereum and that Ethereum could be used to audit OT.  Currently an OT server owner could theoretically inflate OT assets.  I'm trying to wrap my head around how Ethereum would audit an OT server.  I'll be sure to ask fellowtraveller (Chris Odom) and/or Vitalik.

With things like iris scans, the problem is often that yes, those measurements do have relation to if the person is human, and it may even be hard to do if the person isnt co-operating. However, you can't really use the measured data in ethereum. I cannot exclude the possibility that there is no way to have a contract use the data.. But i have my doubts.

To be honest, i think there is a better chance trying to create a human identity by having a network of humans with some incentive to add 'true nonduplicates' and an disincentive against duplicates, or an incentive to point them out. Stuff like pictures and iris scans(with data off-blockchain, possibly linked via a [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)) can definitely help these networks, but humans will use them to help figure out if someone is already in the system.

"Conference, Alpha Testnet and Fundraiser Updates

January 29, 2014 - By Team

Ethereum received an incredible response at the Miami Bitcoin Conference. We traveled there anticipating many technical questions as well as a philosophical discussion about the purpose of Ethereum; however, the overwhelming amount of interest and enthusiasm for the project was much larger than we had anticipated. Vitalik’s presentation was met with both a standing ovation and a question queue that took hours to address.

Because we intend on providing an equal opportunity to all those who want to be involved, and are reviewing the relevant logistical and regulatory issues for a fundraiser of this scale, we have decided to postpone the Feb 1 launch of the fundraiser. We will make the announcement of the new fundraiser launch date on our official website: Ethereum.org.

The Ethereum project is also excited to announce the alpha release of the open source testnet client to the community at the beginning of February. This will give people an opportunity to get involved with the project and experiment with Ethereum scripts and contracts, and gain a better understanding of the technical properties of the Ethereum platform. Launching the testnet at this date will give those interested in the fundraiser a chance to better understand what the Ethereum project is about before participating.

The testnet will include full support for sending and receiving transactions, the initial version of the scripting language as described in our whitepaper, and may or may not include mining. This will also be the first major cryptocurrency project to have two official clients released at the same time, with one written in C++ and the other in Go; a Python client is also in the works. A compiler from the Ethereum CLL to Ethereum script will be released very soon.

A note on security

The fundraiser will NOT be launching on February 1st and any attempt to collect funds at this time should be considered a scam.

"I'm not involved with Ethereum so I can't answer for what will be there from the start, apart from saying that things which can not be currently done, will not be in Ethereum from the start :p 

Now, there is several issues at hand here though. One is to keep keys and password secure attackers that might steal the resources they protect, another is ensure a computation has been executed correctly. 

My current understanding, hope vbuterin will correct me if I say something wrong here, is that Ethereum scripts will be executed by the miners, which ensure they will be executed correctly. Now once you have obfuscation, you could add obfuscated code to the blockchain, or maybe even external services like Maidsafe, which an Ethereum script might then tell someone to execute. So basically, once obfuscation technology matures,  if you want to upload a script to the blockchain, you run it through an obfuscator first, then upload the obfuscated script. The obfuscator just would be a local program that you would run on your computer, so Ethereum itself doesn't really need any special support for this. 

I have some related questions myself that perhaps someone knows the answer to?

What are the plans regarding IO operations in scripts? Allowing a script to make an arbitrary network connection opens many possibilities, but has a lot of security issues. As I understand in, the current version is Turing-complete, but when it comes to IO, its mainly just that a contract can store some data in the block chain.

How scalable are Ethereum scripts? What would be required to make it work with millions of large complex scripts?

&gt;In [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and [marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing), **product differentiation** (or simply differentiation) is the process of distinguishing a [product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business\)) or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular [target market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market). This involves differentiating it from [competitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition)' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by [Edward Chamberlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Chamberlin) in his 1933 Theory of Monopolistic Competition.

"I think I understand what you mean. I believe the complete opposite, I think Ethereum is going to reduce scams if not eliminate them altogether. 

First, it's currently impossible to obfuscate contract code, so all contracts will be in clear text. Anyone pretending to create a contract and not delivering on its promise (frontend/backend schism) would be immediately flagged a scam both by the users of the said site AND on chain. Just like if amazon kept 33% of the credit card numbers to buy themselves fancy paintings, I think we'd know. Ethereum is about to add decentralized, Sybil attack proof reputation systems on top of all that. 

Second, in order to be trustless and decentralized most if not all contracts of an 'escrow' nature would have to have 100% if not more collaterals attached to them, on both sides. Hard to scam if users automatically get their money back.

Third unlike the financial derivates in today's financial world, derivatives in Ethereum would be backed by Ether, or even Bitcoin, and not debt. Good as gold.

Fourth Ethereum makes the building of such services so trivial than consumers will never have been in such a powerful position to 'vote with their feet'. Worrying that someone could scam others with Ethereum is the same as worrying that someone could ask for a cc number on a website today, then disappear the day after.

You gotta be careful releasing stuff like this. What you are doing, intentionally or not, is elevating your project to the level of great people and projects who have already done stuff. You are making comparisons between Buterin and Jobs for example.

Steve Jobs is dead and gone and has inspired others, but Steve Jobs has done something. Now hey, maybe, your guys are right, and Ethereum will live up to these lofty aspirations, but...

There was another thread a few weeks back about maintaining a level head during this whole startup period. Making videos like this might not be doing that. Hell, people criticize Apple for being pretentious, but they are Apple, they can get away with it for various reasons.

If you can make stuff like this, and the project pulls it all off, more power to you. But this is the kind of stuff that makes people despise you, root for you to fail, and if you do, the laughter isn't going to stop.

"Afaik ethereum uses a key-value system. if you use `contract.storage[H(name_string)+k]=..stuff..`, the values of `k` you never set dont require storage.

(I think the allowed range of `k` has to be really large for it to really be a problem though..)

Still i prefer the idea of a separate id-contract . However, the second contract doesnt seem neccessary because k∈{0,1} should be fine.

The goal isn't to use a decentralized identity to grant access to a centralized website. That only is going halfway.

Ex: I don't want to use WhatsApp(rely on centralized infrastructure), I want to message p2p(rely on my own or decentralized infrastructure).

If its possible using namecoin, great. My intuition is that its much easier to accomplish on ethereum, as contracts have access to the storage to other contracts.

&gt; Things like 7 again demonstrate either a lack of comprehension or ignorance of our design, contracts are more than robust enough to launch a proof of stake subcurrency. 6 seems to ignore ethereum script is turing complete and thus you can compile a language like c++ into it (anyone ever used coffeescript to write js)?

&gt; On a side note, I am honestly curious how Invictus intends on building DACs without a turing complete language?

"(right.. probably a lot of people dump a lot of ideas near you.. sorry if i am one of the pointless ones.. I should get on the test-blockchain/look at scripts)

One thing i wondered about, isnt proof of stake essentially effortless, the slasher^[link](http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/) algo being there to actual punish the otherwise costless condoning of incorrect or 'loser' blocks.

But since it is effortless, why not have multiple PoS chains. To mine, you wouldnt in principle need to be full client to notice if you see that you are below the score of `checksum(append(X,own_wallet_address))`, where `X=checksum(append(previous_hash_of_block,random_number_of_slasher_of_block))` all you would need is the list of those `X`.

You would need to have to see if the blockchain you won in is actually correct, and you may be punished later by some mechanism like slasher if it isnt. Preferably winner nodes would have time somehow to make themselves full-node regarding that chain or use partial-lightweight clients.(the latter difficult to implement?) I should look at Nxts transparent forging thingy..

And something is needed to transfer coins between blockchains. Could be that you'd just rely on both lightweight clients regarding a lot of them, or you'd need a system of automatic coinswaps, where people tell they client with hot coins to participate..

One advantage here is that providing full-node security isnt all-or-nothing.

"Why do we need to have enforced rules? What sort of rules?

Afaik Twister basically gives every person a little bit of data that people can access. It has a namecoin-like system to associate things with pretty names.(unlike TOR, see no reason the DHT would have any name other than the 'simple' one, just the one on the blockchain under a name can write to a particular name)

From the [whitepaper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152), its three 'mostly disjoint parts'; blockchain, Distributed Hash Table(DHT), bittorrent-like thingy. That seems to corroborate that there are no complicated rules to enforce, and i read the blockchain part and it only contains user registrations. Found the paper hard to absorb, so may have missed a bit, but from what i read i am pretty sure there is no tough identity data in the blockchain, or rules to deal with. They probably could simply join namecoin, or ethereum, or even both, by just having a little namespace for both.

Btw about twister, hmm probably you can DHT a string, so doing that to URLs.. So presumably it can do a 'comment anywhere'.. A 'documentation everywhere', with some kind of wiki mechanism would be neat too.

Even with a blockchain, why would clients bother to put any information about namecoin in, they can just use the address namecoin tells them is associated on client side, and the blockchain of whatever system they use only needs to know that address. When they want to go back they can just query back client-side too.

The only place where that seems to be an issue is when the namecoin indicates a change of data, like a pubkey for that system. However, the older key would still be in the namecoin system, so finding back the name should be possible..

Hell, in principle ECDSA pubkeys can be the same accross, though people have worry about the security of often-used ECDSA public keys to the point of suggesting not reusing them. Whenever you receive new coin, you can easily change addresses.

"Afaics every script that is somehow a 'permanent fixture', with no connections to particular people, and that somehow never loses too much funds to get deleted is essentially equivalent to being a feature of ethereum. 

I cant answer your question, but the above implies ubfuscating privkeys into ethereum itself, not scripts would do the same.

Also, that is a *strong* statement. I.e. if you could for instance have 'magic infinite funds' for something like the [dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflsmuz), basically having that file could be used for mining! 

Note afaict the dropbox scheme does not actually pay for serving the data to people.. Got [a concept](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1yvr3a/bitcoins_price_fall_will_affect_ethereums_launch/cfoa3j4) for that too, but with inflation subsidy servers would create fake viewers. Basically it cant be taken for granted that mechanisms cant be played.

Still, many scripts could be subsidizable with inflation, and not be fraudable.(i dont quite know)

Anyway, a little inflation may be a good thing, but it does beg the question who should get the coin. Regular mining is wasteful, so these are interesting, and that it can be done with script is aswel. Perhaps sub-currencies of ethereum could do it internally.

That said, i dont quite know how to give such a sub-currency value, ethereum itself could presumably only do it, but we currently only have relatively limited practical knowledge of scripts. Voting on scripts that would subsequently get some limited-to-the-desired-inflation 'magical funds' is an idea, but voting might presumably done by weight of coins, so there is a danger to overcentralization of coin through it..

"Probably all contracts still have to be figured out or further refined. It is a platform or a cryptocurrency and contracts. Contract writers have to figure out things that work economically, and popularize it!

The namecoin issue could fairly easily be fixed, a namecoin contract could do ranges of namespaces, you could buy a range and send an address to a script instead to some piece of data. The script controls that bit of namespace by its output, or state. Maybe someone(the ethereum team?) might want to add a namecoin contract particularly to start off the tree of namecoin contracts, set a consensus point to start that off. (it would be a pita if browsers have to figure out from which namecoin that link is coming)

DAO investments can be held up, firstly for any interaction, you can apply reputation/stake systems(which havent been developed yet either) which could be used between developers and investors.(question in that is if the developers have enough reputation to wield) Secondly, there are all sorts of ways of attaching things onto the DAO script itself;

* It may need starting reputation/stake, 
* Need to buy a name in a namecoin, and perhaps other interactions with other scripts. 
* The wages of the developers can be encoded.

The developers cannot run away without losing the investment in the script, and the script may contain a feature where investors can vote to cancel and return some of their money, or there may be a timeout system. (Of course the development may be about developing the script itself, the script invested in would then just contain the investment features initially)

DAOs can be rather nebulous.. is Namecoin is not that much investment to write..(though i suppose we might want to think about how to do that thing best we can) Probably a reputation/stake DAO would be similarly nebulous. Tbh i am not sure if i would call them organizations. (automatons?)

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain). So note that nTransactions and nBlocks is going to be at least linear in time (just like Bitcoin) but the contract memory requirements (the most radical change in scalability characteristics from Bitcoin) is proportional to the number of contracts but does not necessarily continually grow over time. (If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

"Um. From what you've written, it seems as though you're missing the point.

The issue isn't a fork of the *code*. If that were the issue, your argument would be right.

The issue is that people might set up a whole competing *block chain*, using essentially the *same* code. That's a completely different kind of ""fork"".

You could take a copy of the *exact* Ethereum code you guys produce, change a few parameters, and have it running on an alternate blockchain with no premine at all. They'd be creating a completely separate alternate currency, call it Ether-prime.

The things that makes one currency more attractive than another are other people to trade with, total volume of money you can move, prestige... and the share of the wealth that the prospective user can have. Code quality and features don't come into the question... especially if they're both using the same code.

The argument being made is that prospective users will see that they can get a bigger share of the wealth in Ether-prime than in Ether, because there's no premine in Ether-prime. At the beginning, neither Ether nor Ether-prime will necessarily have many users to trade with or much volume of money moved... so share of the wealth becomes a big motivator. The only things Ether will have over Ether-prime are prestige and good will, and those may not be enough to make people accept the premining.

If enough people choose Ether-prime over Ether in the beginning, Ether-prime becomes the *dominant* currency rather than an *alternate* currency. Which means that ""official"" Ether on the original block chain could have much, much less value than you anticipate.

Again, this could happen with NO modification to the code. There wouldn't really have to be a project. There would just have to be a nucleus of people who agree on a different set of parameters, early enough in the game that they can get enough mindshare to displace the ""official"" Ether.

Any proposed response to that should be aimed at making the Ether more attractive than Ether-prime for early adopters. So, for example, if you run a limited beta with selected ""loyal"" users, that means that as soon as you release the ""real"" system, new users will immediately have somebody to trade with in the Ether blockchain, whereas Ether-prime is left playing catchup. You use the exreme power of network effects to make your Ether more attractive than Ether-prime.

Now, even if you don't do that, you'll still have prestige on your side at launch... and that's a powerful force. On the other hand, it seems as though the only alternate currencies that succeed in growing with Bitcoin already established are currencies that people perceive as having fairer mining models. So you should know that you have a powerful counterfocrce against you.

And what you've written makes it sound like you don't even understand what you're being warned *might* happen.

"Hi, this is something that matters to me.

But first, I'm not sure I understand your '50 dollars' comment. It's indeed very likely we'll see native mobile Ethereum clients right out of the gate, either built as reference clients, or based on community projects. These will be free, as I'd expect them to be. For reference, see this potential Objective-c Client project: http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/629/ethereum-objectivec. Android is a no-brainer.

Second, these clients will support any Ethereum Dapps. We're already factoring mobile phone displays for the distributed GUIs powering Ethereum, either as HTML and/or QT packages spread across bitttorrent nodes. On that topic, I encourage you to read this article by our CTO Gavin Wood at http://insightsintoamodernworld.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/apps-what-web-30-looks-like.html. It's very early days, but Gavin will be presenting mockups of this type of interface at our London event on May 9th. Don't think smart contracts, think 'decentralized web'.

Third, an anecdote: Emerging economies tend to skip technology generations. For example, in the Philippines few have landlines, but smart phones are everywhere. In Kenya, by 2009, mobile payments had already been adopted by 40 percent of the adult population, facilitating ~10 percent of the country's GDP. This may not mean much to you, but you should have seen the Billions invested by companies back then in Europe, attempting to push 'mobile payments' as a 'thing'. Project Oscar would like a word, please (http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/project-oscar-mobile-payments)

Finally, and this is my favorite topic, using reputation in place of collaterals. In Europe, when you need a loan, you use your house or car to 'back' the loan so to speak. What about countries where people do not necessarily have such assets? Are they out of luck? Well, in East Africa, Chamas (social groups - thank you John Samson Karanja for introducing me to them) could be a solution. Peers vouch for a group member, literally collateralizing debt with reputation. I'd love nothing more but to see this system operating globally, as opposed to the local communities where it currently strives. 

This is when one realizes that not only emerging economies could benefit from a project such as Ethereum (Somalia, with its absent rule of law, might be a prime candidate), but that actually, our own economies have a thing or two to learn on the topic. Microfinance, decentralized crowdfunding, and peer to peer insurance could indeed be the saving graces of many countries' economies.

Given that this is not a completely unlikely scenario, and there isn't much to say it won't happen, why should funders risk putting money into a project which wouldn't return their investment? Would they not be better off waiting for launch and jumping in on exchange? 

If they do feel confident and fund the project but 2 years later it falls apart, the devs have already been paid in Bitcoin, other devs get the code, but what do initial funders get? They get left holding the bag.

&gt; And I can tell you that any developer with half a brain, which is still not enough to start understanding Ethereum's code and protocol, would largely prefer to join and help than try and be the latest copycat failure.

I'm not sure about that. There's a lot of idiots making altcoins right now, and you still have smart devs like Sunny King putting together things like Primecoin, Peercoin, Vertcoin, etc.

Bitcoin was able to avoid competitors being an issue because for the first 2-3 years there wasn't an immediate real competitor, and it was able to harness the network effect, to the point where even today where other alts have better features, it can maintain its status. Ethereum won't have this, there will likely be clones and alts before it even goes live.

&gt;

&gt;In [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and [marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing), **product differentiation** (or simply differentiation) is the process of distinguishing a [product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business\)) or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular [target market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market). This involves differentiating it from [competitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition)' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by [Edward Chamberlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Chamberlin) in his 1933 Theory of Monopolistic Competition.

"Our general answer is the following:

1. If you look at Bitcoin itself, there are many altcoins that are strictly superior to Bitcoin (eg. Litecoin has 4x faster confirmations, Primecoin has 10x faster confirmations and a slight social utility benefit, Datacoin lets you insert data), and yet all of them combined have maybe 15% of the market cap that Bitcoin has. Network effects seem to be pretty powerful, though as I often argue not nearly absolute.

2. The number 29.4% is a complete fabrication. There is an endowment of 0.3x the amount sold (ie. 23.07% of the initial supply), but that's not all for ""us"". The point is to use this slice to support anyone involved in core Ethereum development (and later on not-so-core development), of which one quarter has been distributed to several dozen developers over the past five months but three quarters are still unclaimed. Think of it as an alternative distribution slice for those who don't have powerful CPU/GPUs to mine or money to invest. One of our major challenges is figuring out how to decentralize this distribution mechanism over time. 

3. Unlike the altcoin/Bitcoin case, if anyone comes up with an alt-ethereum, because Ethereum is Turing-complete we can fork the functionality right back into Ethereum proper as a contract, where it will gain the benefit of being able to interface directly with an existing ecosystem of currencies, liquid decentralized exchanges, data feeds, etc.",0,t1_cgs1ive,t3_22ylxq,t3_22ylxq,False,,5,False,Founder,1433348291,1397480564,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,5,,cgs1ive,True,0

"Well, just like in regular economics, if it were too expensive people wouldn't use it and so the price would drop as there gets to be a surplus people want to liquidate their ether and not wait weeks to do so. Same for if the price gets very low, people will utilize the extra value. These balances keep the currency at a value determined by the market, and no one will really know what the market entails until the chips fall.

People writing and using contracts want to entice miners to include their transactions in the new blocks. If the miners demand high prices, people will use it less and they would be forced to lower their demand to maximize profit.

A higher price could very much increase adoption. If the price is very expensive, more people will make a profit mining. It seems that normal computers will not be much worse than ""mining"" rigs and so people might just mine for what they need and forego an exchange altogether.

One thing is for sure, people are going to be using it and it won't get to be prohibitively expensive. What that means will be seen as we don't yet know the true utility of the system and so we can't predict demand. what might seem expensive right now may be justified in how useful it is. For instance, the option to unequivocally claim ownership of a house via the public ledger may be worth a few thousand dollars, something handled by banks right now. When banks aren't needed for the paperwork and all the legal issues, there will be more excess money and it may flow into the Ethereum replacement. Maybe it's only worth $0.50 though, it all depends on how the system runs as a whole and what it can sustain.

As far as verification is concerned, the cost of running scripts is not less than verifying if the hash found by another passes the difficulty test. In the Ethereum whitepaper it says there's a block time of 60 seconds. As I understand it this means a miner needs to be able to execute all scripts within 60 seconds to be able to validate a block. 

The fees become cheaper as the total processing power of the network grows, but this says nothing about the processing power of individual nodes. Cheaper fees means more and longer scripts on the block-chain. There can come a point where so much code needs to be executed to be able to verify a block that slower miners can't keep up.

I believe in open source code and your arguments are used in support of it.  However I get the impression that these contracts are more like snippets of JavaScript, written for specific applications.  People used to trust these snippets because they were designed for a very specific purpose, but even though the source was plainly available they generally weren't reviewed by any number of people.  Remember all the extra bullshit people had inadvertently placed on their MySpace profiles when that was popular?  A huge proportion of users cannot or *will* not read even the most rudimentary code snippets.

It's no different than being able to put money in the bank at 1% interest. The larger depositor gets a bigger return, but only in the same proportion to his savings as the little guy. If everybody is growing at the same exponential rate, their relative size stays constant.

But actually, it's better. With dollars, the large bank depositor can often get a higher interest rate, so he does end up growing his portion of the pie.

"You can check my previous posts for arguments as well. You're acting like the team is not attempting an active dialogue with the community. We are. This project isn't just another coin. It's not a fork of Bitcoin. We're dealing with lots of complexities and we want to see this technology succeed. That's going to take money and focus. 

In fact, here's my previous post criticizing posts like yours: 

&gt;Arguing against a pre-mine makes sense if you're talking about nothing more than a fork of bitcoin with slight code modifications. After all, what have you really done to earn a pre-mine? But unfortunately this hardline stance on pre-mine has become a standard meme to unthinkingly repeat. Ethereum is starting from an entirely new codebase. A team had to be organized - all of the code has to be written, tested, and audited. There will be many other costs - legal fees, salaries, etc...

&gt;This isn't a simple fork of an already existing coin - it's an IPO of a project which happens to have a decentralized monetary instrument as part of its product.

&gt;If we applied this ""absolutely no pre-mine"" mentality to anything else it would be apparent that your stance makes no sense - let's use farming for an example.

&gt;If we treated farming the way you're treating the ethereum pre-mine we would expect the farmer to buy the land, hire the workers, plow the fields, plant the seed, grow the plants, harvest the crop, and do any other work necessary. Then, instead of getting any of the harvest for himself, or any discount on the vegetables, you scream ""unfair!"" and demand that the farmer put the entire harvest into a huge pile which you and the farmer and everyone else in the town have an equal chance of getting food from.

&gt;This isn't fair. This isn't logical. This makes no sense. We can't expect that people should do massive amounts of work and then compete on equal footing with those who didn't for a piece of the same pie.


We have big plans, and none of them are ""be greedy"" or ""be thieves"". We're facing complex problems in uncharted territory and attempting to solve them in the most elegant way we possibly can. We're not simply trying to release a coin into the wild - we're attempting to bootstrap an entire ecosystem, and we want to be able to do things for the community that have never been done before. That said - I'm sure mistakes will be made. 

If you would like to be part of the solution then it is not difficult to join that dialogue. But screaming ""thieving liars!"" is not constructive and it does not offer any solutions. You're acting as if we're some secretive organization plotting behind closed doors against you, whose attention you must get by being as loud as possible. That is not the case. We are here - but we are also busy. We are doing our best to organize as quickly as possible and engage the community in a meaningful way. It will take some time, we are doing our best.

"Just because I say others will develop this technology considerably faster than 6 months does not mean they will do it worse than you will or with the goal of ""pump and Dump"".

that's an arrogant assumption that the Ethereum team is the only group that can make this happen.

So far I have seen a lot of talk and no release.

Meanwhile Megacoin and counterparty are operating and being improved now.

And I am sure there will be others. 

Maybe stop going to conferences and talking about ideas as if they are only yours that everyone is also talking about and actually write some code?

"For what it's worth, here's what /u/adam3us (Adam Back) had to say about how this affects Ethereum in another thread:

&gt; It should be possible to replicate ethereum fuctionality, or actually fork ethereum FOSS code itself, replace ether with real bitcoin (via the 2-way peg) and run it on a side-chain. If a feature coin can run on a 2-way peg (and its secure &amp; useful) it will be forked and 2-way pegged.  
  
&gt; New law of crypto currency: if it can be 2-way pegged, the project does not need its own alt. If it has its own alt anyway, it will be forked and replaced with bitcoin.  
  
&gt; This is not a new problem, but it highlights the natural limit on profitability and self-defeating nature of alt-shares that try to premine all or part the transactional currrency: any user past a moderately succesful level of use will fork and replace the premined transactional currency. Replacing the currency with bitcoin is neutral and fair. It is just not plausible to imagine a few early speculators owning the entire transactional currency for the world.  
  
&gt; Bitcoin itself is different, its &gt; 50% disbursed, electrically efficiently, and was a genuine ultra high risk speculation in the first few years when most of the disbursement happened. People who mine bitcoin now are not getting rich. Ownership is wide. Anyone can choose any investment level. There is a natural (decentralized) monopoly for durable engineered scarcity (bitcoin), advantages are strong for everyone to use it. Its definitional: if another me-too scarcity displaced bitcoin, neither bitcoin nor the newcoin would be viewed as durable. Starting new scarcity races for feature coins is self-defeating as a funding model with no other feature outside of the source, it can and will be forked if it gets use. Starting new scarcity races is also grossly unfair, coins should have a reason for existence, and making the param-tweaker rich is not a reason.

"This is a useful line of inquiry.  Going back to current industry practice, an investment manager typically has been delegated to make her secret sauce decisions within ""investment guidelines"".  That is, there is a universe of legal investments (e.g., S&amp;P 500 common shares, AAA-rate commercial paper with duration under 30-days, etc.).  This is amenable to smart contracting.  For example, a multisig etherfund account that Alice can spend as long as an oracle of some sort countersigns that the trade is within guidelines.  And it may be easier to construct this using the OT security model, especially if OT/ethereum cross-audit functions are at hand.  
I remain concerned that people push around the trust without recognizing that it pops out elsewhere.  The ""oracle"" may be designed to be zero-knowledge (the transaction was for something on the list), but we are begging the question of how items get on and off the list.  E.g., is Bernie's cousin now forging AAA ratings or the Standard and Poors index membership, or just diverting the stream of data to the oracle so downgrades or delistings are delayed?  The potential revolution in the blockchain and smart contracts is that for trust we may ""choose our poison"" rather than having a trust model poured down our throat.  If I buy a US stock mutual fund, then I accept the trust model:  management company is a 40 Act registered fiduciary, the fund is an SEC-regulated (and 50-state-regulated under blue sky laws) security, the prospectus includes an audit opinion from a known accounting firm with a reputation.  That's what I get, one size fits all.  When I choose to ignore that Bernie's accounting firm was not a major known name and that the compliance officer named in the prospectus was a relative of Bernie's, then I haven't even used the security model available to me.  If I had bought a fund that owned Enron stock, relying on the opinion of Arthur Anderson, I was victimized by the collusion of the ""independent"" auditor and the corrupt management of the firm, by the failure of the SEC to detect the fraud, by the failure of the fund manager to conduct due diligence into the investment risks and rewards.  Maybe all of the above. With ethereum/OT/bitcoin perhaps we can move the risk around, and choose to take the compliance officer or the auditor out of the equation.  Or require the fund manager to execute some predefined due diligence.  But it ends up hardly being trustless.

"We are building a computational device/appliance and in order to operate the device a certain type of token is required as fuel in appropriate quantities.  

When purchasing ETH in the Genesis Sale, the buyer is supporting the development of the product, just as with a kickstarter campaign.  When the product is completed and ready for delivery, buyers will be able to claim their purchased ETH from the genesis block.

Here is a snippet from a document to be released before the commencement of the ETH sale:

Distributed applications on Ethereum require payments of a token to fuel every computational and storage operation on the system.  Without requiring payments for operations, the system would be vulnerable to many sorts of attacks and would not be viable or secure.  The payments are made to owners of computational resources in exchange for securing the Ethereum network, for transmitting transactions, for storing data and for processing computations required by distributed software applications.

Part of this document describes this process as well as the Genesis Sale and perpetual issuance of the “cryptofuel.”  Parties interested in purchasing ether (the cryptofuel) in the Genesis Sale to power business applications, to trade on forthcoming exchanges, or to speculatively hold for future sale to businesses, are advised to carefully read and understand the risks and usage section at the end of this document.

"Solved? No, at least not for me.

The goal isn't to use a decentralized identity to grant access to a centralized website. That only is going halfway.

To really be 'solved' in my mind, I need to be able to use my decentralized identity to verify access to decentralized infrastructure. 

Ex: I don't want to use WhatsApp(rely on centralized infrastructure), I want to message p2p(rely on my own or decentralized infrastructure).

If its possible using namecoin, great. My intuition is that its much easier to accomplish on ethereum, as contracts have access to the storage to other contracts. Thus, you can define an 'identity' as a network of modularly linked persona contracts(contracts only editable by one address) and services (also contracts).

The fact that these services(infrastructure) are contracts also means that they can be forked at will.

However, moving on to your ""secret investment fund"" problem, let's think about the way 40 Act funds solve this problem today.  That is, fund investors and competitors are able to see the fund positions as published after the fact in the prospectus, and they can see the signature of the audit firm which observed all of the transactions up to that point.  This might be the best you can achieve: Alice executes fund transactions in a separate, hidden account and puts the (hash of the) audit trail onto the blockchain after an appropriate aging period.

When looking at Ethereum for the first time some things were immediate obvious improvements to Bitcoin such as GHOST, however, I was slightly disappointed to not see proof of stake. I have been unable to get the Slasher link to work, so I don't know what/if anything is being considered in that form.

Peercoin with its proof of state setup already is more energy efficient than Bitcoin and going forward if the network grew would become even more so. It does seem somewhat important to me, especially if you had a massive number of transactions (a global currency), that using a proof of stake system which was energy efficient could be very important and a huge advantage.

I saw in another post of yours that you said that proof of stake is difficult to have linear inflation with. I do know Peercoin does have inflation, though I am not especially educated on the topic and linear inflation might not be the same thing.

Based on just the title of the Slasher link I guess you are already thinking and have thought about this. My question would be is there any desire to get proof of stake into Ethereum and if it was not in at launch would it be something which could be added later?

I don't think the team of Ethereum get it. The whole reason that Bitcoin has become so huge is that it's been in the hands of the people since day one. Bitcoin has managed to build a lot of goodwill in the community because of this. The kids who mined in 2009 are some of its strongest proponents and entrepreneurs today.

The importance of community has recently been magnified by the rise of Dogecoin, which started out a joke, but has quickly passed most of the other altcoins with its innovation and utility.

While I think the people behind Ethereum are brilliant, I'm afraid that an IPO will prevent it from truly becoming mainstream. It will be another footnote in 5 years time, alongside all of the other great ideas that never took off (coloured coins, next, ripple etc.). Ethereum needs a strong community behind it, and I don't accept that it's just a marketing exercise (i.e. so let's set aside some funds for a few people to maintain a twitter).

As Amanojack said, the developers will become rich through mining and buying early if the project is even remotely promising in the first year.

"Contracts are busy doing all sorts of trustless stuff, which may include locking up ethers and definitely precludes just suiciding. Hell, some of them dont even have owners.

Even if they could be drained, this would make it entirely trustful that the owner sets up the thing the same way.

NameReg doesnt have one.(edit: an owner, i mean) Or does it? Better go check :p Seriously though, in principle it doesnt need an owner.

*A* solution is not a burn-over but basically just forking it and having everyone switch at the same block. You would have the program able to do both protocols at the same time, and have the change take a fairly long time after release. But this is difficult, makes switching non-optional, and it is quite possible that some people will be screwed...(edit: that dont update their clients, it would be entirely preventable by the individuals)

Cant really copy the contracts and burn over the rest either; people anticipating it would stuff everything in a contract that pays them back later. Then it gets copied, they collect the ethers from the contract on both chains, and then burn to double their money.

Hmm, perhaps you can solve that.. you copy over the money and contracts like a fork any, and then also have burn over. It will get doubled either way, for everyone, in effect not mattering.(may halve the displayed value over the real value to illustrate that) If you're on Ethereum 1.0 you're half in Ethereum 2.0, and the burn is to get you all the way there.

"My responses:

1. Yes, contracts might have vulnerabilities. But, following Ethereum's general design philosophy, we're not going to introduce paternalism as part of the base protocol. What people can do, though, is create compilers that automatically add such failsafe checks.
2. There are two ways to solve the randomness problem. First, use a block hash as the seed. Second, have a multistep protocol. Step 1: A generates random x and submits H(x). Step 2: B generates random y and submits H(y). Step 3: A submits x. Step 4: B submits y. Step 5: If exactly one of x or y does not match the hash, the incorrect submitter loses. Otherwise, A wins iff x+y mod 2 = 0, else B wins.

"Thanks for your insightful comments, Vitalik. I look forward to discussing the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Health Insurance at an upcoming Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup. I'll use the opportunity to address the points you brought up and seek out others' feedback as well; in the meantime I wanted to share a few thoughts that come immediately to mind. 

1. Interface: Excellent point. In general, I believe that society's familiarity with centralization (and lack of familiarity with sharing economies) will mean time &amp; energy expended creating a culture shift. Will we see the emergence of AirBnB-like website to facilitate the formation of these autonomous groups? Can these types of matchmaking websites simplify pairing between individuals and healthcare providers to the point that the lay person can subscribe to DAHI with minimal effort?

2. Social/Incentives
In addition to aligning incentives (always tricky in healthcare), there’s also the issue of the composition of the group of (autonomously) insured people. How can we ensure consistency in how healthy/unhealthy each group is, so that we don’t end up with groups of all-healthy people and groups of ultra-unhealthy people? Could this be facilitated by a matchmaking-like website as described in (1)? Or by inherent rules built into the contract to prevent discrimination based on medical conditions? Or rules that group people based on geographic location?

3. Legal: Another excellent point you bring up. I’m excited about the potential to both do great social good, as well as collect initial data, in the developing world. DAHI makes a lot of sense here. I also think there could be opportunities to experiment in the US. I agree that trying to completely substitute health insurance with blockchain would be difficult up front, but physicians, particularly those in private practice, are free to choose how they’re reimbursed. There are even groups of physicians and solo practitioners whose practice consists mostly of private payers, and they could theoretically be good early adopters of DAHI if they are willing to accept Ether/cryptocurrency as reimbursement (at least for a portion of their services).

Thanks for the great feedback. I look forward to discussing further.

"Jeffehhh answered the questions below, but for the sake of clarity:

EVM-code (aka 'ES1/2' or 'Eth ASM') is run in a virtual machine. Just like you wouldn't write java bytecode by hand, there is a need for a higher level language to make Ethereum accessible to programmers of all levels. 

This higher level language is actually a set of languages, in order to be as inclusive as possible. HLL is a bit python-like, LLL is lisp-inspired. There will be many more, with talks of community projects already working on LUA and Javascript compilers. The one you choose will probably the one the most in-line with a language you already understand.

There will be IDEs yes, and in fact the wonderful http://k1n0k0.github.io/ethereum-simulator/ ethereum simulator already supports Syntax highlighting. Compilers could be baked in directly in to the clients, just like the C++ AlethZero implementation currently does for LLL, or seperate and even web-based.

The goal isn't to use a decentralized identity to grant access to a centralized website. That only is going halfway.

To really be 'solved' in my mind, I need to be able to use my decentralized identity to verify access to decentralized infrastructure. 

Ex: I don't want to use WhatsApp(rely on centralized infrastructure), I want to message p2p(rely on my own or decentralized infrastructure).

If its possible using namecoin, great. My intuition is that its much easier to accomplish on ethereum, as contracts have access to the storage to other contracts. Thus, you can define an 'identity' as a network of modularly linked persona contracts(contracts only editable by one address) and services (also contracts).

The fact that these services(infrastructure) are contracts also means that they can be forked at will.

"You *should* link to the [issuance model](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper#wiki-currency-and-issuance). X ether is bought, total of 0.5X goes to others. 0.225X would be time-locked, probably with a script, so verfiably so. 

0.4X is mined per year, the premine is very acceptable. 

I think the developpers ether share is a little high. They could vary the issuance to themselves as dependent of the ammount of BTC-bought. Idea being that the larger the community, the smaller the fraction of that community is developpers, so their share should be smaller. Also, the ammount of ether bought is an indicator for the potential success of ethereum, so the more is bought, the more ethers are kindah worth, and so the smaller the fraction is to provide some level of value. (The expectation of value of the premine should aways increase with buy-in)

If they want more ether, developpers could buy ether by donating BTC to some charities or something.(dont burn BTC for this purpose, it's silly)

Forks... Well afaik there is no way around it. This is why we basically need to try keep users of cryptocurrencies somehow focussed on developpers and knowledgable people. The lame-ass clones of course shows that a few of them can be convinced, but the effect looks larger than it is if you look at volumes.

There are also 'friendly forks'. Eventually a bitcoin2 or Ethereum2 would be made, I mean i find it hard to believe that there wont ever be a need for that.

In the open-source land of Ethereum, there's nothing to prevent anyone from copying an algorithm and using it for their own benefit. So how might DAC operators cope with this challenge?

Perhaps the Algorithm itself could be hosted off-chain, where its code doesn't necessarily have to be visible to all. Perhaps there's simply an understanding that investing in the DAC will provide an opportunity to profit from the Algorithm - even though its inner workings aren't visible.

"See, that's the problem; I don't think that way. If there's one question that keeps me awake at night, it's the thought that perhaps everything I've sank my life into for the past 3 years is a technological and ideological dead end, and perhaps traditional centralized institution-based mechanisms based around corporations and banks and governments and incremental innovation respecting the existing establishment are actually the best way for society to move forward in solving the issues that really matter for the majority of people. It's sometimes not a nice way to live, being plagued by self-doubt when other people around me enjoy the certainty of zealous fervor (especially when the Bitcoin price is dropping 5% per day for the past week), but as someone dedicated to maximizing the amount of good that I do with my life I feel like it's a very healthy thing to have in the long term; Ethereum would not nearly be so well off if I acted like invincible man and ran with every single crazy idea I had instead of internalizing and applying a strong BS filter.

For what it's worth, I am very confident that the crypto behind Ethereum is fine from a technical standpoint, and that we have the skills to do it. In fact, I'm confident that I personally can release the blody thing myself in some fashion if that's what it takes. If I was not sure of that, I would not have written and published the whitepaper; I would have just made a magazine article telling other people to do it and describing what the issues are. It's the social issues that get me.

"Charles is very good at explaining this stuff. If governments start asking you to explain yourselves in hearings, send him.

And speaking of which, I know it would be much more convenient to set everything up in Canada, but I think it would be much better if you set it up in Switzerland or Iceland. Canada is just too close to US, and the Harper government is almost as bad in these sort of things from what I understand (seems to favor mass surveillance and other stuff like that). I don't think it's going to be much of a difference between setting it up in US and doing it in Canada, ultimately.

Switzerland is not perfect either, and in the past few years at least has started bowing down to US government more and more, like when they [shut down Assange's account](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11929034) based on a technicality (right around when US was doing everything it could to shut down Wikileaks - but I'm sure that was just a coincidence...). 

Then, last year, for the first time ever, Switzerland agreed to [share banking information](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-tax-switzerland-idUSBRE9B80S320131210) about its clients with the US. That's basically the one thing Switzerland is known for (customer privacy), and they gave that out like nothing to US. 

Now they're trying to promote themselves as the ""anti-NSA"" country or something, saying their datacenters are held in bunkers and whatnot, and that they want to be the [world's data haven against mass surveillance](http://www.securityweek.com/swiss-set-sights-becoming-worlds-data-vault). If it's going to turn out to be as much as a haven as it was for banking, then it probably won't mean much.

Iceland might be a good second choice, and might even be a better choice than Switzerland. Wikileaks got some pretty good protection there, and the whole country decided not to bail out the banks. They even made Visa pay for the blockade against Wikileaks.

So if Ethereum starts a financial revolution that endangers the world's banks, Iceland is probably the safest place where you want to be. They've also recently created the [AuroraCoin](http://auroracoin.org/) so they seem pretty forward thinking about this stuff. You could even tell them to build AuroraCoin on top of Ethereum :)

If you set it up in Switzerland, they might actually turn out to be your biggest enemy, because a huge part of their economy relies on its banks. Yes, normally we'd like to think that Switzerland will see common sense, and *want* to be part of the new revolutionary financial systems built on top of Ethereum. But usually when incumbents are threatened by disruptive innovations, they get very aggressive about it and want to squash them.

The more I think about it, the more I think you should strongly consider Iceland for your headquarters.

There are a *ton* of reasons why they may come after you if Ethereum fulfills its vision. From your typical ""we want to stop money laundering"", to ""facilitating piracy"" or ""gambling"" with P2P apps that can't be shut down, to users avoiding taxes (and blaming the platform for it, as usual, because it makes a nice easy scape goat that's usually much easier to shut down or limit). But I think the biggest one will be facilitating the elimination of the banking system. So I don't think this should be taken lightly.

Be as legal as you can, try to talk to goverments ahead of time (including the US gov which has far reaching influence all over the world), and explain what Ethereum is and what it can facilitate (good things), the way the Bitcoin Foundation did in US (and seemed to work out pretty well). Because if you're not ahead of these things, the media itself will start to run with the ""underground"" ""dirty"" ""crimes"" that Ethereum makes possible, and then they won't believe you anymore.

Even today some of them still talk about Bitcoin from a drug crime point of view, and I've noticed a lot of ""normal"" people buy into that story, and think that's what Bitcoin or other cryptocoins are *mainly* used for, because the media puts such an emphasis on that ""intriguing"" aspect of them.

But ultimately, it's better to be in a safe place, too - just in case the US government and others don't buy your story.

"My responses:

1. Yes, contracts might have vulnerabilities. But, following Ethereum's general design philosophy, we're not going to introduce paternalism as part of the base protocol. What people can do, though, is create compilers that automatically add such failsafe checks.
2. There are two ways to solve the randomness problem. First, use a block hash as the seed. Second, have a multistep protocol. Step 1: A generates random x and submits H(x). Step 2: B generates random y and submits H(y). Step 3: A submits x. Step 4: B submits y. Step 5: If exactly one of x or y does not match the hash, the incorrect submitter loses. Otherwise, A wins iff x+y mod 2 = 0, else B wins.
3. State. The solution to the problem described here has been known for many years; it's called [purely functional data structures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-854j-advanced-algorithms-fall-2005/lecture-notes/persistent.pdf). Ethereum uses [purely functional 16-ary Patricia trees](http://wiki.ethereum.org/index.php/Patricia_Tree) internally.
4. Queries. There is no such thing as an ""owner"" of a contract; once a contract is created it just exists.

"The market price is ultimately going to depend on:
1) Supply vs. Demand: Does demand exceed supply, and does growth of demand exceed inflation.
2) Usefulness of the protocol: Can Ethereum really do what the founders think it can do?
3) Ecosystem: Will people develop awesome apps to take advantage of the protocol?
4) Will transaction fees (payable only in ether) be set at the appropriate level (or float to the appropriate level) so that the protocol isn't too cheap or too expensive to use.

You are using a supply-side argument--that the people generating the ether will just pluck a price out of thin air, which may be cheaper than the presale price. I'm using a demand-side argument--that the price of ether will float based on how demand relates to supply. If this thing is amazing, then demand is likely to severely outstrip supply.

People were actually selling beta invites--something the ""right people"" could get for free. Why were people paying for something that was designed as a free service?

So with ether, there will be a set amount...1.5X...available in the beginning, and then 0.0333 per month after that from mining (total of 0.4X per year).* So...does Ethereum do amazing things which causes an influx of users/speculators to buy up lots of ether in order to use or speculate?

"A coordination language is really about building large systems, like the Daemon in Daemon/Freedom. In such systems you might use Ethereum to deal with finances and resources for example, but have other components that deal with other stuff. The different components can be people, servers, algorithms, various software etc. so then a coordination language is used to make all these components composable, so they can all form one integrated system.

For example if one process is a person scanning a specific type of document, then a component could be made that looks for new documents in a folder and the person scanning the documents knows to save all scanned documents in that folder. That component now really encapsulates the scanning software and the person scanning the document, if you were to switch the scanner, the scanning software and the person with, say, a fully automatic scanner, the component would still look and behave in exactly the same way to all the other components in the system. The thing is really about wrapping all the jobs, software, web servers etc in this kind of components, then describe the flow of data, money, resources and things through a network of such components.

Since such components are not necessarily pure software, you can use types that refer to physical objects. For example a component for a 3d printer, can have one input and one output. The input has a CAD model as the type, while the output might have ""ABS plastic thing"" as the type. If the 3d printer was switched to another printer of even injection molding, as long as it takes the same input, the CAD model, and outputs an ABS plastic object, it wouldn't matter for the rest of the system. The output of the 3d printer component might be connected to a robot arm component, that would expect to find an ABS plastic thing at a specific position, but the robot arm does not care how that ABS plastic thing ended up in that specific position, just programming function doesn't care how an integer which is going to be its input, came to existence.

"Kindah interesting if things can have intrinsic value. Well, of course someone could say 'here is a pot of gold, one gold coin for each ethereal gold coin', but that aint exactly trustless!

Maybe shops can have 'vouchercoins' but i dont know how they would co-ordinate that. They would have a bigger surface area for customers to know they dont actually have the stock, and a 'shop run' is a different beast than a 'gold run'...(not sure if any better, but different :) )

Trustlessly, ether itself has intrinsic value *in* Ethereum, because it can be used to do transactions, have scripts with storage. [The dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflp7z1) suggests there are other ways to make intrinsic external to ethereum value be identifiable by ethereum, making it trustless.

I dont fully understand that code though, looks to me like every 100 blocks, someone can get ether by proving you have some random bit of the data? But that doesnt prove anyone else than the prover actually has access to it, and afaict people can actually compete for it.

I have different concept for the idea, the viewer puts some coin at stake in a script:

    //NOTE: currently PSUEDOCODE(still looking into the script itself..), even so CONTAINS HOLES

    view_signature= tx.data[1]

    // redeem_difficulty, redeem_profit, VIEW_REQUEST
    
    //Server didnt get his shot at payment, because the viewer didnt send proof that
    // it was served. Server can punish by destroying coin on _both_ sides.
    //view_signature is now the signature of the request.

       destroy_coins(2*tx.value)
       stop
    
    //Server wants to get the coin for serving it. To limit fees and not weigh down
    // the blockchain too much, he only has a probability.
    //view_signature is now the signature of the viewer telling the server he got
    // the gooods.

          stop

     invalid //If you get here the transaction cant even get on the blockchain.

Basically after the server sends files, he gets a shot at getting paid, and if he doesnt, he has recourse, even though it costs both parties. You could tweak the ratio.. 

Note that it needs a starting time aswel, otherwise servers might just accept to serve when they happen to win the lotery.(it needs to be future checksums) A harder to solve problem is that the viewer himself may try to extract everything before miners get to it by making successful requests until he finds payouts. 

Servers would of course look at the script to establish its difficulty and payout, and if it contains enough coin in its balance.

Edit: also note that the server may get multiple attempts at winning the reward, you can calculate the probability and average payout, so no problem there. You could make it so that millions of views pass without payout; without *any* transaction occurring on the blockchain. Of course you want payouts to be small, but big relative to fees, but serving up data is really cheap.

Edit: of suppose you could combine this with the dropbox code to reward holding on to data even if no-one views it. Also note that the medium across which the data is accessed is not even in play in either script. Could be system where anyone can serve it up, where the cheapest methods win, that also depends on location of viewers.

"Charles is very good at explaining this stuff. If governments start asking you to explain yourselves in hearings, send him.

And speaking of which, I know it would be much more convenient to set everything up in Canada, but I think it would be much better if you set it up in Switzerland or Iceland. Canada is just too close to US, and the Harper government is almost as bad in these sort of things from what I understand (seems to favor mass surveillance and other stuff like that). I don't think it's going to be much of a difference between setting it up in US and doing it in Canada, ultimately.

Switzerland is not perfect either, and in the past few years at least has started bowing down to US government more and more, like when they [shut down Assange's account](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11929034) based on a technicality (right around when US was doing everything it could to shut down Wikileaks - but I'm sure that was just a coincidence...). 

Then, last year, for the first time ever, Switzerland agreed to [share banking information](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-tax-switzerland-idUSBRE9B80S320131210) about its clients with the US. That's basically the one thing Switzerland is known for (customer privacy), and they gave that out like nothing to US. 

Now they're trying to promote themselves as the ""anti-NSA"" country or something, saying their datacenters are held in bunkers and whatnot, and that they want to be the [world's data haven against mass surveillance](http://www.securityweek.com/swiss-set-sights-becoming-worlds-data-vault). If it's going to turn out to be as much as a haven as it was for banking, then it probably won't mean much.

Iceland might be a good second choice, and might even be a better choice than Switzerland. Wikileaks got some pretty good protection there, and the whole country decided not to bail out the banks. They even made Visa pay for the blockade against Wikileaks.

So if Ethereum starts a financial revolution that endangers the world's banks, Iceland is probably the safest place where you want to be. They've also recently created the [AuroraCoin](http://auroracoin.org/) so they seem pretty forward thinking about this stuff. You could even tell them to build AuroraCoin on top of Ethereum :)

If you set it up in Switzerland, they might actually turn out to be your biggest enemy, because a huge part of their economy relies on its banks. Yes, normally we'd like to think that Switzerland will see common sense, and *want* to be part of the new revolutionary financial systems built on top of Ethereum. But usually when incumbents are threatened by disruptive innovations, they get very aggressive about it and want to squash them.

The more I think about it, the more I think you should strongly consider Iceland for your headquarters.

There are a *ton* of reasons why they may come after you if Ethereum fulfills its vision. From your typical ""we want to stop money laundering"", to ""facilitating piracy"" or ""gambling"" with P2P apps that can't be shut down, to users avoiding taxes (and blaming the platform for it, as usual, because it makes a nice easy scape goat that's usually much easier to shut down or limit). But I think the biggest one will be facilitating the elimination of the banking system. So I don't think this should be taken lightly.

Be as legal as you can, try to talk to goverments ahead of time (including the US gov which has far reaching influence all over the world), and explain what Ethereum is and what it can facilitate (good things), the way the Bitcoin Foundation did in US (and seemed to work out pretty well). Because if you're not ahead of these things, the media itself will start to run with the ""underground"" ""dirty"" ""crimes"" that Ethereum makes possible, and then they won't believe you anymore.

"Right, you mean you want ethereum contracts to be able to access all the info on the namecoin. Whereas i just thought 'its an entity and it has a psuedonym', and in many cases you can do fine without the namecoin info itself.

In some cases users of a contract could at the beginning start by establishing agreement on psuedonyms/identities.

Edit: the current namecoin example comes pretty far already. I mean you can do what i suggested is sufficient. Defining as 'names' in the system:

Cant really copy the contracts and burn over the rest either; people anticipating it would stuff everything in a contract that pays them back later. Then it gets copied, they collect the ethers from the contract on both chains, and then burn to double their money.

Hmm, perhaps you can solve that.. you copy over the money and contracts like a fork any, and then also have burn over.

"(right.. probably a lot of people dump a lot of ideas near you.. sorry if i am one of the pointless ones.. I should get on the test-blockchain/look at scripts)

One thing i wondered about, isnt proof of stake essentially effortless, the slasher^[link](http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/) algo being there to actual punish the otherwise costless condoning of incorrect or 'loser' blocks.

But since it is effortless, why not have multiple PoS chains. To mine, you wouldnt in principle need to be full client to notice if you see that you are below the score of `checksum(append(X,own_wallet_address))`, where `X=checksum(append(previous_hash_of_block,random_number_of_slasher_of_block))` all you would need is the list of those `X`.

You would need to have to see if the blockchain you won in is actually correct, and you may be punished later by some mechanism like slasher if it isnt. Preferably winner nodes would have time somehow to make themselves full-node regarding that chain or use partial-lightweight clients.(the latter difficult to implement?) I should look at Nxts transparent forging thingy..

And something is needed to transfer coins between blockchains. Could be that you'd just rely on both lightweight clients regarding a lot of them, or you'd need a system of automatic coinswaps, where people tell they client with hot coins to participate..

But you call it BtcEth, but how do you subsequently relate it to bitcoins?

One scenario: (edited for clarity) Both sides need clients on both bitcoin and ethereum.

* You(Y) want BTC from ether you buy BtcEths from the contract.(or rather, its just ethers that are locked up to ensure presence)
* Some person P wants ethers for BTC and requests a trade. (could be later or before)
* Software on Y's client notices this and gives indication that it is online.
* P chooses from online clients that want BTC, and sets up a bitcoin transaction dependent on H(S), and revealing H(S)
* Y(and possible) sets up ether released upon knowing S.(based on H(S)
* P releases the ether transactions towards him, revealing S. Then Y(and others) use S to release the transactions paying them BTC.

Really, though, it is all about communication here. P is really just looking for offerings, concensus is only needed for the 'upon-release' transactions.

Edit: Not sure, perhaps it *really* helps; i mean the BtcEths contract can provide a stick that people dont lie about wanting BTC. Still, i think maybe communication between clients knowing adresses like that needs to be made somewhat easy too?

"Isn't this over-engineering? Shor's algorithm can only be used on quantum computers, which don't really exist in any meaningful fashion.

To my mind, it'd be better to create a working version of Ethereum that isn't immune to Shor's algorithm, and then update it to Ethereum 2.0 in the future (Bitcoin-QT has had several updates in the past.

I feel this is especially important given that Ethereum's fundraiser has been delayed - things do not seem to be running on schedule.

Replacing ECDSA with a signature scheme that's immune to Shor's algorithm is a worthwhile and admirable venture. But currently it's an academic one, while Ethereum has a current practical need.

"Lets put the fundraiser in simple terms that everyone can understand. Everyone should agree that all investments should have a proper risk/reward ratio. This project itself has a lot of risk and potentially a lot of reward, so neither can outweigh the other. Now lets look at this objectively from that perspective.

Ethereum project;

Risk = Very High

Reward = Very High

Founders;

Risk = 0%

Reward=100%

Early adopters;

Risk = 100%

Reward = ?

Put that on a graph. Does that seem like a fair transaction to you?

Just look at the risk/reward ratio and it is way out of line, bordering on insanity. Hubris and Greed comes to mind. If you were the world's greatest cook and asked a venture capitalist or businessman to fund your new restaurant, Guess who makes the most money? Whoever takes the most risk. That's the guy who is paying for the risk out of his own pocket. It's been that way since the beginning of time. Granted, if you have risked a lot of your time and mental energy, you deserve payment for assuming that risk of your time and potential energy as sweat equity.

This is the only project that I have ever heard of that the founders have no sweat equity, no equity in capital and want all the rewards before the business even opens and then will ask the investment community to fund the entire project before it even starts and assume all of the risk.

The current investment model is appalling and downright thievery of the bitcoin community. Vitalik, please quit trying to instill a sense of fear and demand by constantly bringing up ""whales"" as an excuse for this model. That's just lame and I can't believe people will fall for that (edit...yes I can believe some people will). We can all guess whose idea and where those tactics were borne from.

They need to offer more ETH per bitcoin, lower the MAX to an acceptable level and therefore the pre-mine. And lower their shares of the coin to a level that doesn't reflect a persona of greed. If they are right and follow through, they can still be multi-millionaires by changing the structure in a way that it is not overly diluted and fair and equitable to early investors. The way it is structured now, they are punishing you for being an early adopter and instantly becoming wealthy without any risk at all.

I feel that if you are going to ask the investment community to fund the entire project sight unseen, then there must be checks and balances of risk/reward for founders and early adopters. This project is NOT a slam dunk, there is immense risk to go along with the rewards they are alluding to. Therefore the founders must take some risk themselves and give opportunity for early adopters to gain reward.

2) To do that, they are raising money from investors, which will go to a foundation that will fund development, prizes, etc.

"&gt;there would be nothing stopping the miners themselves from creating blocks that are arbitrarily hard to compute.

Can you elaborate on their incentive to do this?

&gt; Bitcoin has the 1 MB limit; Ethereum needs to have either a mandatory fee or a few mandatory limits of its own.

It seems to me that if computational power is already a scarce resource, then why would further restrictions be needed? Shouldn't the market be able to price computing cycles on its own? 

Another thing I'm worried about is that two contracts could cost the exact same in terms of computation power but could represent completely different value to their respective users. This could show up in cases where one needs an important contract to be verified in as little a time as possible so that user may be willing to pay more for miners to prioritize it. Conversely, someone who can't afford to have their contract verified within minutes should be able to pay *something* and have it processed within a day or two. A fully market-driven fee structure should accommodate this.

This also affects people in developing countries who may not be able to afford the minimum transaction fee because it's too expensive relative to the value of the services backing it. It would make sense if they could pay a much lower fee and just expect it to take longer to process.

"I agree 'cryptocontract' or 'self-enforcing contracts' would be better words. Cryptocontracts by themselves cant send anyone to jail, of course, and the worst that your wallet itself can do is reach zero. Lack of resources for your own sustainance or other people have to do it.

Also there are a lot of potential scripts that are good out there. Including giving more assurances. For instance you could have a script with your money, but you can only send from it at some set rate. It could have a list of N trusted people, M from which together to change the address. That is one mechanism to stop major accidental mistakes sending money. 

People of course have to be careful what contracts/scripts to use Afaik people can basically only end up with bad contracts if they're stupid(or stupid to act from badly informed information) or too limited in options. Both can happen in the real world already, and rarely does the 'flex' in non-factum contracts actually help anyone. Quite the opposite, from what i hear. Significant rights reductions for loans that happen to be owned by the state, in the Netherlands, they totally changed the rules for retirement funds, and 'mortage' means 'house with loan' here. You cant default and leave the house, you'd keep the remaining debt, on the plus side. (Goddammit my mother said with a regular mortage, if you leave the house at the last moment, everything paid on the house is gone, but that is actually a better situation.. I mean in the former it is all gone and you still have to pay some more..) And the bailouts are also examples where the rules bend, also to our detriment.

I reckon if the rules are bendable they'll usually bend towards those in power. There will be cases where this probably isnt enough. Crypto contracts need to pick their fights.

When looking at Ethereum for the first time some things were immediate obvious improvements to Bitcoin such as GHOST, however, I was slightly disappointed to not see proof of stake. I have been unable to get the Slasher link to work, so I don't know what/if anything is being considered in that form.

Peercoin with its proof of state setup already is more energy efficient than Bitcoin and going forward if the network grew would become even more so. It does seem somewhat important to me, especially if you had a massive number of transactions (a global currency), that using a proof of stake system which was energy efficient could be very important and a huge advantage.

I saw in another post of yours that you said that proof of stake is difficult to have linear inflation with. I do know Peercoin does have inflation, though I am not especially educated on the topic and linear inflation might not be the same thing.

Based on just the title of the Slasher link I guess you are already thinking and have thought about this. My question would be is there any desire to get proof of stake into Ethereum and if it was not in at launch would it be something which could be added later?

"Ursium, I respect the work that you and the team are doing, but unfortunately my posts in this thread come off as overly critical.

I respect the rights of the devs to get paid. They should be compensated. But there are a lot of devs and teams in the open source world making good shit and they aren't getting paid to do so. The rewards they get are fame and then sometimes they turn that into money.

You can look at someone like Vitalik (I don't mean to ignore the other devs, he is just the most prominent) and know that even if he wasn't getting paid he'd be working on this. Hell, if you guys do the fundraiser and literally got $0, would Vitalik stop working on it? Yeah right. Even if he did, the cat is out of the bag, someone else will run with it, there is no going back.

When this project was first announced, I immediately wanted to put money in on the fundraiser.

"That's a very interesting question only if it is properly understood. The question is a technical one and has to be answered in technical terms. I might add that the question wasn't phrased properly, by my understanding.

&gt; The issuance model will be as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; Ether will be released in a fundraiser at the price of 1 ether for 0.0001 BTC. Suppose that X ether gets released in this way.

&gt; 0.25X ether will be allocated to the founders in a time-lock contract that prevents the founders from spending it for one year.

&gt; 0.25X ether will be allocated to the Ethereum organization as a reserve pool to pay expenses in ether such as ether salaries or bounties for those developers who want part or all of their compensation to be in this form

&gt; 0.5X ether will be mined per year forever after that point

To me, this means that the total number of coins will be 1.5X. I might have misunderstood.

Let me explode the main inquiry into sub-questions:

1. Why will 16.7% of the initial coins be allocated to the founders? (why the number)

2. Why will these coins be spendable after one year and not immediately?

3. What benefits do you have of personally owning pre-mined coins?

4. Why create a non-profit?

5. Why send 16,7% of these coins to the non-profit? (why the number)

6. Why use a fundraiser?

"Sounds important. But doesnt neccesarily affect ethereum?

I am sure some dusty-minded engineers are thinking they're doing it for efficiency. Cant help but wonder if they looked at youtube videos crossing, that is going to be a lot of data..

Whats the status of FOSS/software activist groups trying to affect/do HTTP development? Could there be any way to both be able to cache and have it anonymous?(seems unlikely, but.. crypto is very wtf)

So basically https the private key is at the server, but they mitm it because the certificate authority can say 'this pubkey is good too', and then a intermediate server uses https, and then retransmits with a different privkey. One way around this could be to just start a separate certificate authority? Edit: that wouldnt help, the browser would just tell you it doesnt trust the pubkey, not give you a way around.. You could add another layer of encryption, so then they would have to add another layer of mitm, haha.

Btw should use [Tor](http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/), btw. That said, even when using tor-to-clearnet, this would decrease privacy a tiny bit, as the exit node and snoopers beyond it can see more.(darknet is unaffected by this) Of course, it is *much* less efficient for internet traffic. Note: wikipedia mentions https being developped for tor nodes.. I think they mean the *exit* nodes can enter malicious stuff, the intermediate ones can only tell where it came from and where to send it.(But not where the subsequent node will send it)

People already thought of fake searches to decrease tracking.(when i saw it, it was poorly implemented) Fake browsing is also possible. Main problem is how to do all the thing the browser does without showing the user anything, and how to figure out the 'real' links.

If they try to block people will try encode it into data looks otherwise, once they try block that, wasting a lot of cpu, they will hurt businesses that are accidentally also blocked, and people trying to not be tracked(stalked) all the time go stenography.

"Actually in the grand web 3.0 scheme, I'm not sure that tracking the cosign accounts in a contract (ie in the blockchain) is the right way to do it. I think that this should be a wallet feature implemented with some kind of ""wallet storage"" not shared with the world (similar to the HTML5 localStorage). The user should also be able to sync his ""wallet storage"" content on whatever device he use. So for now a contract storage would works, but eventually I think that this is not the right place for this kind of data.

Similarly I think that the transaction should be created directly by the ethereum client (via a Ðapp UI) and not by a ""deployment contract"". I can create whatever contract I want, and in this case I see no reason to require a worldwide blockchain consensus about the creation step itself.

About the merging of vote I agree that a separate vote counter would be a valid solution (and optionally a rejection counter). But as the blockchain is a very expensive storage I feel that the data shouldn't be redundant. My idea was that if voter A and D said `yes`, and voters B, C and E hasn't voted yet we could encode that state as `10010`. Then if voter B says `yes` we simply use the bitwise OR `|= 01000` so the new state will be `11010`. But 1/ counting the `1` would require some kind of recursive functions, and 2/ I don't know how to implement the reject operation (do we need it?).

"my thoughts on basic identity system:

contract one:

    human-readable-name → eth address
    eth address → human-readable name

contract two:

    eth address → contract address

contract three (one per identity):

    identity info (only editable by that eth address)

Eth address is the key to everything. Linking things to this allows for contracts to be used by users piece-meal. Some want human names, but not identity info (or use namespace for a different purpose). Some want identity info, but without a human name. Others want to create their own nameserver, but link their the same identity info. The thing that links all of them is you need an ethereum address to edit the network.

We modularize contracts to the level it makes economic sense. Too many contracts = too many lookups/too many transactions to edit links. Too few contracts = not enough reuse/value in using a single chain.

Clients should be clever enough to know which contracts to point to by default (yet change for personalization). All contracts on one chain democratizes the intrastructure by allowing users to select the component contracts that fit their need by simply pointing to a new contract, while keeping control under the same key, and allowing trusted lookups of contract data that underlie the service logic. (small ex: swap contract one with community nameserver (with more protected access, different rules, etc))

As for accessing data from other contracts, the EXTRO command from the ethereum whitepaper looks like it does the trick. Not sure if a method for getting previous block hashes is possible, though.

"&gt; If some of Maidsafe's technologies rise up to the challenge of crossing this bar then we'll be very happy to use them as our backbone.

We will be glad to see you there as well Vitalik. I believe Ethereum is another great project looking to achieve things never previously imagined.  Its tough, easy, happy and sad all at the same time working at this pace and attempting to read everyone about every project. I will try and summarise some key points regarding MaidSafe and hope it helps. 

We have written many papers and attended many events in this journey. We still find it hard to explain (well I do). I think this is not unusual for a big change. Bitcoin is also hard to explain to some folks. 

We will be launched soon and then will get a chance to measure, tune and check all algorithms. We have had a ton of review though over the years (I started all this in 1996 with a decentralised approach to linux servers that I had designed). In recent years since MaidSafe started (2006) I spent 8 months in a non English place to get peace to do the initial design. I then spent nearly a year travelling around Universities explaining and getting peer review. It's not the be all and end all, but we seek critique everywhere so happy to see it actually. We did work early on and spoke with many people in the field such as Vint Cerf and Deborah Gordon (of the Gordon institute in Stanford), presented at a google conference on scalability and a keynote at the british computer society xmas lecture etc. Also spent a lot of time on kademlia implementation and attacks/designs with Mario Kolberg (one of the the authors in the p2p handbook). A couple of us have spent many years on the cryptopp library (Wei's library) and that's a great place for some pretty deep cryptography questions and ideas. So we search everywhere for valid critique. It is a huge system to describe quickly and that seems to be the main reason for misunderstanding in many cases. None of this is proof of the whole network, but there is a lot of research and testing taken place, including three pre &amp; post doctorate research projects we sponsored for simulation and modelling.  Like everyone we try very hard to make sure we get the system tested as we go along. 

We hope to have some papers soon that further explain some the parts you are discussing or querying here. It may not be obvious or well explained how chained consensus groups work and how they prevent birthday paradox and related sybil type attacks. There was a paper on attack vectors from the data part of the network supposed to be available to the mailing list weeks ago, but it is still waiting on registration for the WWRF forum. We should have posted this paper on  arxiv. 

We will probably try and get the routing paper that explains some of the DHT theory underlying this posted in the next week or so. It will help a lot.  Routing relies on a reliable UDP that has pseudo tcp type connection oriented attributes. This has been worked on by Chris Kohlhoff (of c++ ASIO), Anthony Williams (c++ concurrency) and now another great boost developer Nail Douglas. These parts are critical for full decentralisation of all data in my opinion.

Where single entities (i.e. crypto currencies, structured data version handlers) are involved there are also asymm signatures involved as the chain mechanism cannot work for non group id's.  Currently this is RSA 4096 signatures. So there is a  lot we do not explain in detail, but there is a lot to it all (each client on the network has many crypto key pairs for different aspects, as well as revocation pairs).

I hope this helps folks a little, I think the papers will define more clearly and also show some mathematical modelling of some of these points. ",0,t1_cgblrny,t3_217fsm,t1_cgambcf,False,,7,False,,1433063078,1395768938,dirvine,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cgblrny,True,0
"Ethereum or not, I don't think this should be done without a currency that is also anonymous, such as Zerocash. 

I'm supportive of Toroken, but it may have to fork Tor, because it's doubtful current developers will like it. While this payment thing will be optional, what happens if everyone decides to ask for payment for their node service? Perhaps the Tor network *will* get slower, if few remain that do it for free.

So is there any way the paying users could also subsidize everyone else? Let's say they do get faster speeds, but only 80 percent of their money's worth, while the other 20 percent goes to speed up the network for everyone else, who doesn't pay. This way the whole network could improve its speed, not just for the paid users.

Obviously, now the criticism will come from the paying users, who can say ""why would I subsidize the freeloaders?"". But they should think of that 20 percent of some sort of donation to help others become anonymous, and make the world a safer place.

"Every computational step done on Ethereum, including sending transactions will require tiny payments, so the best analogy in my opinion is that ether is the fuel that powers the execution of distributed applications on the Ethereum platform.

Trading back-and-forth between bitcoin and ether should be quick and easy.  We are working to have exchanges list ether, ATMs sell ether and are also working on methods of having bidirectional ether to bitcoin gateways (much like a sidechain). Ethereum has very different design goals from Bitcoin and we expect both to grow in tandem.

Using bitcoin as the fundamental token on our implementation or on any clone of Ethereum would be problematic.  Our issuance model for ether and security model for the network are intertwined.  We need a large number of miners to operate and secure the network with transaction processing and proof of work.  And we need to incentivize them to do so.  We can't incentivize them with bitcoin in perpetuity.  It would be expensive for us to buy that much bitcoin (not to mention foolish).  We need a token, intrinsic to the network, that miners will perceive as valuable.  Therefore this should be the same token that undergirds all commerce and computation on the platform.  Network demand for ether combined with network security and processing as the main source of ether sets up a positive feedback loop which grows the ecosystem.

Imagine a scenario where this Algorithm is enshrined in an Ethereum contract, and drives a DAC. This is what's coming in the very near future.

One question arises, however: in the case of the VC firm, their algorithm is presumably a closely-guarded bit of intellectual property. It provides a competitive advantage that the firm would not want to relinquish.

In the open-source land of Ethereum, there's nothing to prevent anyone from copying an algorithm and using it for their own benefit. So how might DAC operators cope with this challenge?

Perhaps the Algorithm itself could be hosted off-chain, where its code doesn't necessarily have to be visible to all. Perhaps there's simply an understanding that investing in the DAC will provide an opportunity to profit from the Algorithm - even though its inner workings aren't visible.

"&gt; Dr Gavin Wood spent the majority of his talk on Friday arguing against centralisation. He argued for a need for ethereum as a trust-less system.
&gt; What concerns me is that giving an estimated $20 million dollars to the ethereum foundation to help ""fund development"" will actually just centralize development around the ideas the ethereum foundation wants exploring, not what the community wants, another problem with this approach is that we have to put an extremely large amount of trust in the ethereum foundation not to simply run away with everybody's bitcoins.

The Ethereum team wants nothing more than to find a trajectory that aligns both the community-at-large and the core team members with the same economic incentive. If anyone has math/econ models to achieve this, please share them on [our official forums](https://forum.ethereum.org/) so we can arrive at a solution that is win-win for everyone involved :)

&gt; I have not seen any guarantees about how much of the money raised in the IPO will go to fund bounties and what amount will go straight into the founder's pockets.

I'm under the impression that documents related to this will be released before the ether pre-sale. Again, the question is how to align all the incentives just in the right way to ensure different types of projects run in different types of ways. i.e. An academic research group will operate under different constraints than a for-profit venture.

&gt; Most pre mined currencies have been called out as scamcoins in the past, the only difference between them and ethereum is that there is innovation on top of ethereum and it has been claimed the pre mine is for the good of the currency. I have yet to see a successful premine coin.
&gt;This premium is not at all necessary and is harmful. It will reduce the chance of mainstream adoption of ethereum. Throughout the currencies future, there will be criticism that it is just a pyramid scheme, more so than for bitcoin, especially due to the ""early adopter discount"".

First and foremost, Ethereum is producing actual technology. You can download proof-of-concept builds that interoperate on a testnet from https://code.ethereum.org, which is regularly updated with builds in both C++ and Go for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can mine (on testnet), send gas/ether to other accounts, even create contracts and execute them. People are so excited about the possibilities that platforms and tools are already working on top of the testnet. If you want more info, #ethereum-dev on Freenode is probably a good place to jump in

&gt; Ethereum represents a potentially great idea. I urge the ethereum foundation to reconsider the premine. You are risking the currencies future for short term financial rewards. Please consider adopting the distribution model of æthereum. You could develop your proof of stake algorithm, slasher, to create a currency which does not have the waste of mining. It is my belief that without your support, æthereum will be forgotten, and without your acceptance of æthereum's ideas, ethereum will fail like every other premium currency. Please make this the future, instead of another get rich quick scheme.

If you were to take a straw poll of the main team (including all support roles, not just devs), I think you'd find that the vast majority are **BY FAR** more concerned about the health of the Ethereum ~~community~~ ecosystem than any amount of cash. The unfortunately reality is that many of us have been working on Ethereum for nearly 6 months without so much as a single satoshi in payment. Some of us have families &amp; mortgages and have had to take loans to pay the bills while we clarify all the complications of launching world-impacting technology with geographically-distributed team members on a shoestring budget.

I hope the community can evaluate us on our actions. Scammers would have ""launched"" &amp; disappeared long ago. Instead, we're building alliances with partners all throughout the world, including 40+ self-organized meetups and dozens of developers contributing to MIT-licensed projects. We're doing our best to make it to conferences to speak, explain, and mix ideas with others all while sleeping on the floor, working 18 hour days, and spending our own savings to make sure the technology marches forward, payday be damned. ;)

"The market price is ultimately going to depend on:
1) Supply vs. Demand: Does demand exceed supply, and does growth of demand exceed inflation.
2) Usefulness of the protocol: Can Ethereum really do what the founders think it can do?
3) Ecosystem: Will people develop awesome apps to take advantage of the protocol?
4) Will transaction fees (payable only in ether) be set at the appropriate level (or float to the appropriate level) so that the protocol isn't too cheap or too expensive to use.

You are using a supply-side argument--that the people generating the ether will just pluck a price out of thin air, which may be cheaper than the presale price. I'm using a demand-side argument--that the price of ether will float based on how demand relates to supply. If this thing is amazing, then demand is likely to severely outstrip supply.

Remember back when Gmail first came out, how revolutionary it was? How everybody wanted one of those coveted beta invites? People were actually selling beta invites--something the ""right people"" could get for free. Why were people paying for something that was designed as a free service? Simple--it was amazing, and they wanted to use it RIGHT NOW rather than in a year, and supply (limited by the number of beta spots) was overwhelmed by demand.

So with ether, there will be a set amount...1.5X...available in the beginning, and then 0.0333 per month after that from mining (total of 0.4X per year).* So...does Ethereum do amazing things which causes an influx of users/speculators to buy up lots of ether in order to use or speculate? Or does it languish, with all that ether just sitting there with no buyers? That depends on the strength of the protocol, the ecosystem, and in no small part, the marketing.

"From my perspective, any new technical solution seeking to assist in developing countries needs to address actual (not perceived) problems with accessible solutions. While technical solutions to problems may assist in addressing those problems, they need to be humble enough to understand why and how to market themselves. For example, it is often cited that Africa has leapfrogged legacy infrastructure requirements in land based telecommunications. This is, more or less true, but it is likely a factor of corporate incentives to provide services to predominantly oral societies that has driven this rather than any particular love of a Nokia 6100. It also has some disadvantages because reliable broadband into homes, even in a town like Nairobi, still requires land based infrastructure and providing any level of comprehensive solutions, like APIs for mobile money systems, is exceedingly complicated because the IP is owned by corporations who have no interest in adopting standards. 

How does this apply to the Ethereum project? From my perspective, Ethereum projects which seek to provide solutions in developing countries will need to address a number of factors. First, while there may not be as much legacy legal infrastructure, as with legacy landlines, these legacy systems can have advantages. That said they can be easily corrupted. Ethereum can only address one of the two challenges which legal system users in the real world face. Ethereum will allow users to avoid debates upon interpretation of agreements (these mean that). However, the other major reason legal disputes in the transactional space occur is because there is a dispute over whether a particular event in the real world occurred or not. Ethereum, as a block chain technology, cannot address these. It can provide a framework to begin working towards a contracting methodology of trust reduced proof of real world events, but that is about the best it can achieve in the medium term. 

My point is that technological solutions, even the most elegant ones, do come at a cost and are never perfect. 

What Ethereum could provide users with, though, is certainty with respect to how transactions will operate and how disputes over whether a real world event occurred will be resolved. This is a game changer, but it applies to developing countries no more nor less than anywhere else. Many developing countries may have less developed formal rule of law systems, but they still have rule frameworks in which commercial transactions operate which can be just as sophisticated as legal rules passed by a parliament. So, in my opinion, the competition with other rule frameworks is not *necessarily* lower but it is slightly different. 

Second, people often assume that citizens of developing countries are somehow more willing to embrace change to existing ways and means, but as development economists have more or less shown, the opposite is actually true. People closer to the poverty line have a stronger resistance to change than those in the middle class. To succeed in developing countries, Ethereum projects will likely need to abstract away the brilliant technology behind what is happening and just provide things that work. 

Lastly, any Ethereum project looking to succeed needs to market themselves well. Simply building great stuff is not enough. But marketing well requires time, knowledge, and presence. So time will tell what happens.

"Her are my counter arguments to you.


So far judging from the responses on all Ethereum forums here is what I see. Most of the people posting on this forum and almost all the people that were at the Miami Conference praising Ethereum are developers. There is genuine potential for this platform to be groundbreaking if done right. The devs that are shilling for the Ethereum to succeed have either been involved in pre-fund raising before and want to see this succeed for selfish reasons or they believe in Ethereum and are planning to monetize this platform in the future and want to see Ethereum succeed for selfish reasons.

Then you have the other half of the devs that are not involved with the project, see there are too many risks involved and fearful of wall street taking over the crypto industry
.
Where I feel there is a severe disconnect is that the majority of opinions on this forum, Reddit, etc.. are developers and they will constitute less that 1% of the total amount of investment capital that Ethereum is trying to raise.

If you go to a Conference where the entire majority of reporters have a dev background, you are basically looking at the very definition of a biased opinion and reporting. Just because a small group of technology advanced individuals are excited about the possibility of the tech, doesn't actually mean equate a great investment.

Then you have the 99% of the general crypto population that are only interested in making a quick profit on this coin. They are not particularly interested in this new coin/platform and don't really care about the technology and only if there will be enough ROI to justify an initial investment into the pre-sale. Initially, there was a lot of hype on this coin that drew a lot of interest, but crypto investors cannot be duped. They realize they are not getting into this investment at the ground floor level and with the amount of money/bitcoin that Ethereum is trying to raise before launch, there will have to be 100 million dollar market cap for them to see a profit. 

Long-term is the only reason to invest. There are few pump and dump scenarios that will work with this investment structure that Ethereum is proposing because all the initial ""pump"" profit is being taken out of the market and into Ethereum's pocket right from the beginning.

Long term I see a lot of risks involved with pre-sale investment.

1/ There is risk of immediate loss of equity once it hits an exchange.

2/ There is risk of dilution

3/ There is risk of the company dissolving or bankrupting (however small) 

4/ There is risk of this becoming vaporware

5/ There is risk that it will be forked and cloned

6/ There is risk that there will be too many security holes

7/ There is risk that a newer and better technology with greater funding and transparency will enter the market in due time

8/ There is risk that the altcoin (or platform if you want to call it that) crypto market will crash in a few years.

9/ There is a risk (and I personally feel strongly about this) that the price will be considerably lower once it hits an exchange and falls to what the market feels is an appropriate price for the amount of risk and dilution involved with the project.

Of course, I could be wrong and Ethereum totally sells out and there will be another 100 million worth of btc bid aftermarket. But do you really think that crypto investors are dying to jump in to give anyone 100 million on vaporware on a diluted investment? ALL you have to look at is the forum boards and ignore the developers who are shilling for the product to succeed. There is a huge outcry against the current investment scheme. Why are people so vehemently against Ethereum's structure? Because they feel it has a possibility to be an asset to the bitcoin community but not the way its currently structured.

So in final words, whether you believe in the tech or not, all you have to ask yourself is this. Would I be better off investing in the pre-sale or should I invest aftermarket?

There is absolutely only ONE reason you should buy into the pre-sale, if you believe that it will be so much oversold and the market will not feel that it's diluted to the point where there is another huge group of buyers willing to take it off your hands and xxx times a return on your investment right from the beginning of launch.

Now I submit to you a few simple reasons why you should wait until aftermarket to buy-in.

1/ You NEGATE any risk mentioned earlier in the post and you only have to consider risk/reward. If I buy in pre-sale what risk do I take vs the reward I will have for taking that risk. Do you think there is greater chance that the market price will be higher than lower from the pre-sale price? And to what degree do you need to see Ethereum trade at to make this pre-sale investment worth it for you.

2/ Time value - What could have I done with this money invested in Ethereum that will be locked up from pre-sale until launch on a legitimate market. During those two or three months, you could have that money invested in Bitcoin (which has a lot less downside and at the current level has a good chance of increasing in value) or a dozen new altcoins that will be launching that as you can see we are in the midst of a crypto coin boom. How much money will you have lost by freezing your money up in Ethereum, when it could be actively invested in other more profitable ventures where the initial investment is not severely diluted?

3/ During the time you buy into the pre-sale (several months) and the time you are able to trade your ETH on an exchange, I guarantee you there will several new teams announcing a new platform or coin that will get much better press with a better investment structure. You take the risk of obsolescence even before the coin launches.

4/ By buying into the coin pre-sale and making it a success you encourage Wall Street to take over the crypto coin market and in the future you may see an environment where every new coin launch will be diluted and structured in a way that only Wall Street will increase their millions and the RISK will all be burdened by the crypto community. Ethereum will set a new precedent and if you think this will not happen, think again. Miners and crypto investors will be locked out of the early ""pump"" profits while Wall Street makes millions and we will take all the RISK. The early pre-sale investors will essentially be the bagholders.

5/ Here is the most important reason to wait until it hits an exchange to buy into Ethereum, you NEGATE all the risk I mentioned before and plus you do not enable this kind of launch in the future. There is a good chance that you will be able to buy it lower than the offering price of approx a dollar an ETH. and if the price rises a bit, you can still buy in at the pre-sale price or a little bit higher. The only reason you should be buying this pre-sale is if you believe that there is another 100 million waiting in line to buy ETH and there is no risk involved. You have absolutely nothing to lose by waiting and a lot at stake by buying and enabling this type of coin pre-sale launch.

Now, over the next few days I imagine Ethereum will hire a Marketing PR, they will hype and pump the tech and coin and gloss it over to make it look like they invented the wheel. They will cast out all the doubters and call them ""FUD."" Vitalik will come online and answer questions about the tech. But I say to you forget about all that. Don't get caught up in the tech, we all know the tech has the potential to be amazing. Look at the investment structure. Dont let Vitalik use excuses like this is the best way to avoid ""whales"" from taking over the market. That is so naive. Think!!! Regardless of the tech, is it more beneficial to me, considering risk vs reward, to buy pre-sale or buy aftermarket?

If you choose pre-sale, then good luck, all I'm asking you is to forget the tech and the chatter from the devs and focus on the pros and con of the investment only.

Since I sit on every discussions regarding the business model we're currently finalizing, I'd love to understand how you came to this invalid conclusion. (checking for hidden microphones... no hidden microphones found :))

Now that we have cleared that up, let's look as to why we are making sure to take our time to get this right. We're building a template for what you could call vc or crowdfunding 2.0. We're aiming for full transparency. Open equity, open salaries, open software, open organization, this is going to be open source wall-to-wall. And yes, you guessed right, a transfer to a DAO as soon as possible is in the plan, too. 

We don't want to announce too much before it's ready (tm). There are multiple, very good reasons for this, and since we are continuously releasing software on github in the meantime, I'm fairly comfortable with this choice of preferring to get this right rather than rush into something  everyone might regret later.

I was at an event last weekend and told ten people in person about Ethereum. None of them could get the spelling of Ethereum right, just by hearing the name, when I recommend them to write down a note about Ethereum. And once they will learn about the premine they won't invest.

"Great seeing you at the expo Piotr!

&gt; Well, in Ethereum each account and each contract have their own data storage. There is no centralized data storage, which means custom data can only be stored in this way. This in turn means that there will never be one unique DNS in Ethereum, just a set of DNSs each different for each contract that creates them. Depending on which one you will read from, you may get different results for the same domain.

I'll answer this by analogy:

&gt; In the traditional DNS system, there is no single centralized data storage server, which means that there will never be one unique top-level domain; just a set of top-level domains with one for each country or organization that creates one. Depending on whether you go to bitcoin.com or bitcoin.org, you may get different results from the same domain.

Same argument applies here. A few namecoins will likely become the most popular, and everyone will refer to them.

&gt; Next, the currency needs an issuer, which makes things more complicated.

Actually, you can create issuer-less currencies. All you do is keep a running counter of the last block and allow one transaction per block to automatically assign an additional X units to the block.coinbase. If you want a currency that can track the US dollar or gold or the CPI, then yes, you need either an issuer or a financial derivatives scheme plus price feeds, which we have quite openly admitted is somewhat more complicated.

&gt; Another approach that might work for this could come in a form of Ethereum having awareness of what happens in other currencies. One could create a contract that creates a piece of currency in Ethereum each time a transaction sends money to a given address in say, Bitcoin. This approach would work well if you want to have proof-of-burn currencies, but wouldn't work too well if you would want to redeem the currency back in its original blockchain, unless that system would have some knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain. 

Umm... I think there was an announcement made a few days ago that [pretty much solved](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/12349/side-chains-challenges-potential/) that particular issue.

&gt; Now the question is, what incentive would anyone have to be putting that data into the blockchain?

Two possibilities. (1) as a loss leader for other services (just like the free APIs provided by blockchain.info), (2) the contract would require a one-cent micropayment in order to access it from another contract.

&gt; If we wanted to include data in a trust-less way for say, a transaction happening in Bitcoin, we would need to provide the transaction data, then add the merkle branch and a block header to prove that the transaction is a part of a block, and then perhaps an entire block header chain to show that the blocks are not fake?

Basically, you need to have a contract which acts as a self-contained SPV client for the external blockchain. I describe it somewhat more in detail in the above linked article on side-chains.

&gt; What is the incentive of creating useful contracts in Ethereum? 

Same thing that incentivizes people to write open-source libraries now. That usually means either (1) it's useful enough that your personal benefit from the contract outweights the cost, or (2) as something to show off and draw attention to yourself when seeking out customers or employers. Incentive of development is likely 20x lower, true, but cost of development is also 20x lower.

&gt; If you create the most useful service there is but the only way to communicate with it is through a command line or creating some code, few people will use it. Similarly in Ethereum creating a contract might only be half of the job. The other half would be creating a good user interface for people to be able to use your contract in a meaningful way. I think this aspect is not emphasized enough at this point and may put a lot of people off when they get their first impressions of Ethereum.

It's not emphasized enough at this point because the GUI toolkits do not yet exist. They will soon, and it's been in the plans for a long time to switch emphasis to the interface side at that point.

&gt; I personally think the Ethereum team might benefit from having a more extrovert person that focuses on explaining Ethereum to non-technical people, and bringing in Vitalik to focus on the technical aspects of what they are developing. Using Vitalik for everything isn't all that optimal.

Agreed. I would love to see Charles and Gavin out there more. I'm much better as a coder and cryptoeconomist than to talk to every public audience out there. We need a balance.

&gt; Lets name all the denominations

People only need to remember ether, finney and wei. The others are just there for future-compatibility. The reason why I added different names is because I think it's ridiculous what's going on in Bitcoin now where everything costs 0.0xx BTC, and if it goes up even more it will start costing 0.00xx BTC or x mBTC. Forcing everyone to say ""zero point zero zero"" or ""milli"" every time when that's the de facto default anyway is cruel and unusual punishment.

"Dan, it was great talking to you and hearing your questions at the meetup.  I was the guy asking about accessing external contracts, adding comments to code, and ethereum run/burn estimates for contract authors.

I think you have the public fund scenario all worked out.  The private fund is difficult as mentioned due to the current difficulty obsfucating anything in the contract, be it private key or anything else.

One possibility would be for the private fund transactions Alice performs to be off-chain using Open Transactions.  OT is essentially a trustless notary that signs receipts (uses triple entry accounting).  A balance is simply the last signed receipt.  You can also do Chaumian anonymous cash transactions.  Smart contracts can also be run within OT using Chaiscript.  It's also suitable for medium/high frequency trading, whereas a decentralized blockchain market isn't.  So maybe Bob and/or Charlie send a transaction denoting how much ether (or E subcurrency) they want to invest, and it's stored in Alice's contract.

So the magic trick is to have this investment ether or E subcurrency (signed by A, B &amp; C?) bailed out of the ethereum contract to buy etherfund tokens on an OT server.  So maybe self.issuePurchasingTransaction(securityToTrade, amountToTrade, self.privateKey) sends ether to an OT server controlled Ethereum address in exchange for etherfund tokens sent to an off-chain OT wallet that Alice controls.  These are not ether tokens, but rather etherfund tokens because they are backed by a multisig balance.  The OT etherfund tokens can then be used to trade for other OT tokens on the OT server (either anonymous cash OT instruments or others).  Just a thought, I think there are a few big holes in it.  Like maybe the 3 private keys for the OT etherfund token would need to be time lock/released in an OT smartcontract or else the counterparty on the OT side would never get his unencumbered ether.  Or maybe after Alice trades off-chain, Alice, Bob and Charlie will need to sign transactions sending ether to OT controlled ethereum address(es) for the OT trades to be finalized (releasing encumbered funds to counterparty).  In this scenario, Bob and Charlie really have no idea what Alice bought, thereby keeping the secret sauce secret.

If you need to buy real stock, you could look at making automated ether/BTC/USD exchange and then make API calls to robinhood.io buy real stock in the future (Q3?).  Bit of a regulation nightmare that.

Vitalik said that devs are working on integrating OT with Ethereum and that Ethereum could be used to audit OT.  Currently an OT server owner could theoretically inflate OT assets.  I'm trying to wrap my head around how Ethereum would audit an OT server.  I'll be sure to ask fellowtraveller (Chris Odom) and/or Vitalik.

"Charles is very good at explaining this stuff. If governments start asking you to explain yourselves in hearings, send him.

And speaking of which, I know it would be much more convenient to set everything up in Canada, but I think it would be much better if you set it up in Switzerland or Iceland. Canada is just too close to US, and the Harper government is almost as bad in these sort of things from what I understand (seems to favor mass surveillance and other stuff like that). I don't think it's going to be much of a difference between setting it up in US and doing it in Canada, ultimately.

Switzerland is not perfect either, and in the past few years at least has started bowing down to US government more and more, like when they [shut down Assange's account](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11929034) based on a technicality (right around when US was doing everything it could to shut down Wikileaks - but I'm sure that was just a coincidence...). 

Then, last year, for the first time ever, Switzerland agreed to [share banking information](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-tax-switzerland-idUSBRE9B80S320131210) about its clients with the US. That's basically the one thing Switzerland is known for (customer privacy), and they gave that out like nothing to US. 

Now they're trying to promote themselves as the ""anti-NSA"" country or something, saying their datacenters are held in bunkers and whatnot, and that they want to be the [world's data haven against mass surveillance](http://www.securityweek.com/swiss-set-sights-becoming-worlds-data-vault). If it's going to turn out to be as much as a haven as it was for banking, then it probably won't mean much.

Iceland might be a good second choice, and might even be a better choice than Switzerland. Wikileaks got some pretty good protection there, and the whole country decided not to bail out the banks. They even made Visa pay for the blockade against Wikileaks.

So if Ethereum starts a financial revolution that endangers the world's banks, Iceland is probably the safest place where you want to be. They've also recently created the [AuroraCoin](http://auroracoin.org/) so they seem pretty forward thinking about this stuff. You could even tell them to build AuroraCoin on top of Ethereum :)

If you set it up in Switzerland, they might actually turn out to be your biggest enemy, because a huge part of their economy relies on its banks. Yes, normally we'd like to think that Switzerland will see common sense, and *want* to be part of the new revolutionary financial systems built on top of Ethereum. But usually when incumbents are threatened by disruptive innovations, they get very aggressive about it and want to squash them.

The more I think about it, the more I think you should strongly consider Iceland for your headquarters.

There are a *ton* of reasons why they may come after you if Ethereum fulfills its vision. From your typical ""we want to stop money laundering"", to ""facilitating piracy"" or ""gambling"" with P2P apps that can't be shut down, to users avoiding taxes (and blaming the platform for it, as usual, because it makes a nice easy scape goat that's usually much easier to shut down or limit). But I think the biggest one will be facilitating the elimination of the banking system. So I don't think this should be taken lightly.

Be as legal as you can, try to talk to goverments ahead of time (including the US gov which has far reaching influence all over the world), and explain what Ethereum is and what it can facilitate (good things), the way the Bitcoin Foundation did in US (and seemed to work out pretty well). Because if you're not ahead of these things, the media itself will start to run with the ""underground"" ""dirty"" ""crimes"" that Ethereum makes possible, and then they won't believe you anymore.

Even today some of them still talk about Bitcoin from a drug crime point of view, and I've noticed a lot of ""normal"" people buy into that story, and think that's what Bitcoin or other cryptocoins are *mainly* used for, because the media puts such an emphasis on that ""intriguing"" aspect of them.

But ultimately, it's better to be in a safe place, too - just in case the US government and others don't buy your story.

Absolutely false IMO.

If you guys do run a trustless pre-sale, It would set a wonderful precedent.

I'll have to lament here, but it sounds like all purchases with BTC will be transparent in the blockchain, the exchange rate for each purchase will also be transparent, and the genesis block will show that all purchased ether has been generated.

There's just one more important step: ether collection. Will an escrow function be used to hold BTC until ether has been generated/etc. (according to some predefined terms), and will investors be able to collect their investment using a private key?

"&gt; really fast

That's kind of a non-feature for Ethereum, as most scripts will be *very* simple.

&gt; easy to sandbox

I'm not terribly familiar with ""vanilla"" Lua nor LuaJIT, but have they been security audited for sandboxing? That's something *very* difficult to get right.

&gt; Is there a technical reason this can't happen or is it a preference? I struggle to see the point in reinventing the wheel, spending time implementing an interpreter, compiler, eventual machine code compiler, etc, when you have all of this already available and time could be devoted elsewhere.

The simplest reason I can think of is script compactness, Lua opcodes aren't necessarily designed for compactness (well of course they were to a degree, but that was only one of many considerations made when designing Lua's opcodes, actually don't Lua and LuaJIT use different opcodes?) Note that I'm not particularly convinced that the Ethereum team has done a great job of optimizing for space either, they're using a very straightforward bytecode.

Security in regards to bytecode is also important, a simple bytecode which only has a handful of instructions, with simple implementations is a lot easier to perform a security audit on than the (relatively) large Lua or LuaJIT implementations. Note that securing JITed code is even more difficult.

"What is the purpose of Bitcoin in your view that Ethereum cannot serve? 

From a technical standpoint Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can plus a lot more. The idea behind the scripting language of Ethereum is that often specialized crypto-currencies are not necessary anymore, their services could be build on top of Ethereum.

That's the reason why I'm interested in Ethereum, it looks like a ""general purpose"" crypto-currency.

"A coordination language is really about building large systems, like the Daemon in Daemon/Freedom. In such systems you might use Ethereum to deal with finances and resources for example, but have other components that deal with other stuff. The different components can be people, servers, algorithms, various software etc. so then a coordination language is used to make all these components composable, so they can all form one integrated system.

For example if one process is a person scanning a specific type of document, then a component could be made that looks for new documents in a folder and the person scanning the documents knows to save all scanned documents in that folder. That component now really encapsulates the scanning software and the person scanning the document, if you were to switch the scanner, the scanning software and the person with, say, a fully automatic scanner, the component would still look and behave in exactly the same way to all the other components in the system. The thing is really about wrapping all the jobs, software, web servers etc in this kind of components, then describe the flow of data, money, resources and things through a network of such components.

Since such components are not necessarily pure software, you can use types that refer to physical objects. For example a component for a 3d printer, can have one input and one output. The input has a CAD model as the type, while the output might have ""ABS plastic thing"" as the type. If the 3d printer was switched to another printer of even injection molding, as long as it takes the same input, the CAD model, and outputs an ABS plastic object, it wouldn't matter for the rest of the system. The output of the 3d printer component might be connected to a robot arm component, that would expect to find an ABS plastic thing at a specific position, but the robot arm does not care how that ABS plastic thing ended up in that specific position, just programming function doesn't care how an integer which is going to be its input, came to existence.

"Afaik ethereum can do basically everything the others can do. The others largely have features that arent really up my alley.(but i think i should learn more about the financial ideas behind them)

The main weakness of ethereum is essentially the full-scripting thing, which people often think is prone to bugs. Though it it definitely something to really try hard to keep secure,(which bit of cryptocurrencies arent..) I am not too worried about it. Javascript has had and probably has a lot of security bugs, but interfaces with a lot, ethereum script basically interfaces with stuff that ethereum developpers *also* made, and with a lot less, i reckon.

The second worry/weakness is that the computation and storage of contracts is just too much data to hold on to. Which would hurt volume it can handle, and/or drive the cost of fees up. This one is basically the main worry i have, despite the good lightweight-client thing. That said, if i can be sure there are enough full-nodes out there and the lightweight-client thing works, might already suffice.

Afaik the mechanisms the blockchain works with, the mining etcetera is not exactly set in stone. Fairly confident they're going the right direction. (but not through knowing the direction myself)

The possibilities of the ethereums scripts are enormous, and they are just being explored. Escrow without third party, crowdfunding, subcurrencies, namecoin, dropbox, 'serving and viewing'(not sure of that, dont get responses about it :) ), self-enforcing contracts, (like)self-enforcing rules for organizations, approaches to identify persons to try figure out how to do UBI.

Btw i use the word scripts.. Heard the word (self-enforcing-/smart-)contracts used too, but the problem is that the word contract doesnt always quite fit the bill, script is fairly accurate, but it carries connotations.

"&gt;A signed transaction is an encrypted message, not our private key. What you're talking about using the same private key on a completely different network.

I think that's what the idea actually means. You encrypt a message to proof the ownership of the address. You don't actually give up your private key but rather 'signs' a message using your private key.

Actually ECDSA is pretty flexible in terms of message you can put inside. You can actually use it for something other than transaction. For example you can prove the ownership of an address by signing a message 'Sound_Paper owns this address"" and give the cipher text to other people and they can use your public key to verify that the message originates actually originates from the owner of the address(that's actually what Sign Message function does in Bitcoin Core)

&gt;If I give you a message, and tell you to encrypt it, and then observe other encrypted packets I can deduce the key even on a secure cipher stream.

Well ECDSA is safe from known-ciphertext attack (the attack you just described) as long as you are using random k. That's the reason why currently you can still reuse the address. The signing itself is pretty safe as long as the algorithm is known. That's why probably the simplest way to implement aethereum is to use the Sign Message function in Bitcoin Core as it has already been vouched for by many people (and it is pretty flexible in terms of the message that can be signed).

"First of all let me say that I'm elated with the direction that the Ethereum team is taking regarding mining. It's thinking in the right direction.

I am a little bit concerned that making it fool proof may end up making it so complicated that we create edge cases that get exploited once the ledger is live.

I think the major problem with mining algorithms is that they are misnamed.

Mining is not about expending effort or, finding things or even being decentralized (although the last one is a subset of the intent).

“Mining” is about hosting, protecting, processing and appending the ledger of active transactions. It would probably more ideally be called “Maintenance”. Maintenance needs to be set up in such a fashion that those doing the maintaining never have an incentive or alternatively never get an opportunity to mess with the original intent of the blockchain. Decentralization seems to mesh well with this intent.

The design of ASICs that do general purpose computing is bit of a contradiction in terms. If ASICs emerge that maintain the original intent of the ledger, I cannot see how resisting them would be anything but inefficient to the intent of the ledger. They would be an incredible boon to computer science as they would essentially be “blockchain machines”. If a group becomes dominant (which will happen anyway, if we succeed at general purpose, Amazon will become the dominant Ether mining company), they will have to do so because they “maintain” the blockchain better, cheaper, faster than anyone else.

"Your comparison with Satoshi really isn't fair. Satoshi solved the Byzantine Generals Problem and brought a completely novel concept to widespread adoption, single-handedly.

If Satoshi ever spends his coin, I am sure he will spend the bulk of it for the good of humanity, rather than buying for himself mega-islands/yachts/planes/etc.

If Satoshi had baked into the protocol that even before mining, after 5 years he would get 43% of the bitcoins, you can bet bitcoin adoption wouldn't have been near as big as it was. And I'm sure someone would have forked it to make a fairer bitcoin, which would have grown more popular.

Now compare that with Ethereum.

"&gt; Dr Gavin Wood spent the majority of his talk on Friday arguing against centralisation. He argued for a need for ethereum as a trust-less system.
&gt; What concerns me is that giving an estimated $20 million dollars to the ethereum foundation to help ""fund development"" will actually just centralize development around the ideas the ethereum foundation wants exploring, not what the community wants, another problem with this approach is that we have to put an extremely large amount of trust in the ethereum foundation not to simply run away with everybody's bitcoins.

The Ethereum team wants nothing more than to find a trajectory that aligns both the community-at-large and the core team members with the same economic incentive. If anyone has math/econ models to achieve this, please share them on [our official forums](https://forum.ethereum.org/) so we can arrive at a solution that is win-win for everyone involved :)

&gt; I have not seen any guarantees about how much of the money raised in the IPO will go to fund bounties and what amount will go straight into the founder's pockets.

I'm under the impression that documents related to this will be released before the ether pre-sale. Again, the question is how to align all the incentives just in the right way to ensure different types of projects run in different types of ways. i.e. An academic research group will operate under different constraints than a for-profit venture.

&gt; Most pre mined currencies have been called out as scamcoins in the past, the only difference between them and ethereum is that there is innovation on top of ethereum and it has been claimed the pre mine is for the good of the currency. I have yet to see a successful premine coin.
&gt;This premium is not at all necessary and is harmful. It will reduce the chance of mainstream adoption of ethereum. Throughout the currencies future, there will be criticism that it is just a pyramid scheme, more so than for bitcoin, especially due to the ""early adopter discount"".

First and foremost, Ethereum is producing actual technology. You can download proof-of-concept builds that interoperate on a testnet from https://code.ethereum.org, which is regularly updated with builds in both C++ and Go for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can mine (on testnet), send gas/ether to other accounts, even create contracts and execute them. People are so excited about the possibilities that platforms and tools are already working on top of the testnet. If you want more info, #ethereum-dev on Freenode is probably a good place to jump in

&gt; Ethereum represents a potentially great idea. I urge the ethereum foundation to reconsider the premine. You are risking the currencies future for short term financial rewards. Please consider adopting the distribution model of æthereum. You could develop your proof of stake algorithm, slasher, to create a currency which does not have the waste of mining. It is my belief that without your support, æthereum will be forgotten, and without your acceptance of æthereum's ideas, ethereum will fail like every other premium currency. Please make this the future, instead of another get rich quick scheme.

If you were to take a straw poll of the main team (including all support roles, not just devs), I think you'd find that the vast majority are **BY FAR** more concerned about the health of the Ethereum ~~community~~ ecosystem than any amount of cash. The unfortunately reality is that many of us have been working on Ethereum for nearly 6 months without so much as a single satoshi in payment. Some of us have families &amp; mortgages and have had to take loans to pay the bills while we clarify all the complications of launching world-impacting technology with geographically-distributed team members on a shoestring budget.

I hope the community can evaluate us on our actions. Scammers would have ""launched"" &amp; disappeared long ago. Instead, we're building alliances with partners all throughout the world, including 40+ self-organized meetups and dozens of developers contributing to MIT-licensed projects. We're doing our best to make it to conferences to speak, explain, and mix ideas with others all while sleeping on the floor, working 18 hour days, and spending our own savings to make sure the technology marches forward, payday be damned. ;)

"First of all let me say that I'm elated with the direction that the Ethereum team is taking regarding mining. It's thinking in the right direction.

I am a little bit concerned that making it fool proof may end up making it so complicated that we create edge cases that get exploited once the ledger is live.

I think the major problem with mining algorithms is that they are misnamed.

Mining is not about expending effort or, finding things or even being decentralized (although the last one is a subset of the intent).

“Mining” is about hosting, protecting, processing and appending the ledger of active transactions. It would probably more ideally be called “Maintenance”. Maintenance needs to be set up in such a fashion that those doing the maintaining never have an incentive or alternatively never get an opportunity to mess with the original intent of the blockchain. Decentralization seems to mesh well with this intent.

The design of ASICs that do general purpose computing is bit of a contradiction in terms. If ASICs emerge that maintain the original intent of the ledger, I cannot see how resisting them would be anything but inefficient to the intent of the ledger. They would be an incredible boon to computer science as they would essentially be “blockchain machines”. If a group becomes dominant (which will happen anyway, if we succeed at general purpose, Amazon will become the dominant Ether mining company), they will have to do so because they “maintain” the blockchain better, cheaper, faster than anyone else.

When looking at Ethereum for the first time some things were immediate obvious improvements to Bitcoin such as GHOST, however, I was slightly disappointed to not see proof of stake.

Peercoin with its proof of state setup already is more energy efficient than Bitcoin and going forward if the network grew would become even more so.

I saw in another post of yours that you said that proof of stake is difficult to have linear inflation with. I do know Peercoin does have inflation, though I am not especially educated on the topic and linear inflation might not be the same thing.

In a traditional investment, if the founders take more capital, they usually get diluted more.

Comparing to the Mastercoin kickstart event, no founders got any MSC for free - but rather MSC was awarded only for investment.

It's ok for the ""Ethereum Foundation"" to get a fixed portion of the ethers, because these are indeed reserved for developing the protocol. But awarding an uncapped value of ethers to the founders smells a bit to ""Ripple style"" to me and might cause long term problems later on.

We know where some of the challenges and pressure points are but some are [unknown unknowns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_unknown). Bitcoin for example has yet to come under any sort of full network attack yet. 99.99% of messages sent on the Bitcoin network are well formed and correct.

Proof of stake is still being debated, some academics [think it is worthless](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2393940). There hasn't been enough real world simulation of proof of stake attacks to tell whether it is secure or not. The coming together of psychology, game theory and cryptography makes it very hard to analyse in a mathematical way. Nobody in my mind has yet proposed any implementable strategy which is better than proof of pointless work. 

Ethereum is heading into even more uncharted waters. It will require years of real world testing before it can be verified to be resistant to attacks.

Maidsafe uses some [clever ideas](http://maidsafe.net/maidsafe-network-platform-libraries) but David Irvine has had difficulty explaining them to a wider audience.

"This is a useful line of inquiry.  Going back to current industry practice, an investment manager typically has been delegated to make her secret sauce decisions within ""investment guidelines"".  That is, there is a universe of legal investments (e.g., S&amp;P 500 common shares, AAA-rate commercial paper with duration under 30-days, etc.).  This is amenable to smart contracting.  For example, a multisig etherfund account that Alice can spend as long as an oracle of some sort countersigns that the trade is within guidelines.  And it may be easier to construct this using the OT security model, especially if OT/ethereum cross-audit functions are at hand.  
I remain concerned that people push around the trust without recognizing that it pops out elsewhere.  The ""oracle"" may be designed to be zero-knowledge (the transaction was for something on the list), but we are begging the question of how items get on and off the list.  E.g., is Bernie's cousin now forging AAA ratings or the Standard and Poors index membership, or just diverting the stream of data to the oracle so downgrades or delistings are delayed?  The potential revolution in the blockchain and smart contracts is that for trust we may ""choose our poison"" rather than having a trust model poured down our throat.  If I buy a US stock mutual fund, then I accept the trust model:  management company is a 40 Act registered fiduciary, the fund is an SEC-regulated (and 50-state-regulated under blue sky laws) security, the prospectus includes an audit opinion from a known accounting firm with a reputation.  That's what I get, one size fits all.  When I choose to ignore that Bernie's accounting firm was not a major known name and that the compliance officer named in the prospectus was a relative of Bernie's, then I haven't even used the security model available to me.  If I had bought a fund that owned Enron stock, relying on the opinion of Arthur Anderson, I was victimized by the collusion of the ""independent"" auditor and the corrupt management of the firm, by the failure of the SEC to detect the fraud, by the failure of the fund manager to conduct due diligence into the investment risks and rewards.  Maybe all of the above. With ethereum/OT/bitcoin perhaps we can move the risk around, and choose to take the compliance officer or the auditor out of the equation.  Or require the fund manager to execute some predefined due diligence.  But it ends up hardly being trustless.

The transfer and exchange of coins to ultimately cash them into USD to avoid regulatory laws is the very definition of ""money laundering.""

Yes, but the mining supply never stops. This means buyers can always find a better price than what the investors paid at the IPO. As long as the market price is below the IPO, the investors will be stuck with ether they can't sell.

Let's consider the alternative, where instead the Foundation runs a charity drive and releases the code with ether going purely to the miners.


* The initial funds would be significantly smaller, since the backers get effectively no return.

* There would be much less money to hire more talented developers, so the project would be executed by volunteers

* Since Ether is necessary for development, part of the money of the initial campaign would necessarily go to buy Ether from miners at market value (in fact a market would be the first app that would need to be developed)

* The real financial incentive would be to mine. Even if you have a powerful computer and coding skills, you would probably gain more by using your development machine into a mining rig.

* There is less transparency of how the money is used, and no part on it will be locked into a contract. AFAIK part of the ether reward for the developers will be locked into a vesting contract so they will not be able to sell it for a few years.

Peercoin with its proof of state setup already is more energy efficient than Bitcoin and going forward if the network grew would become even more so.

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain). So note that nTransactions and nBlocks is going to be at least linear in time (just like Bitcoin) but the contract memory requirements (the most radical change in scalability characteristics from Bitcoin) is proportional to the number of contracts but does not necessarily continually grow over time. (If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

* turing complete scripting

Bitcoin has a scripting language, but currently a lot of it is locked down in the official client. Scripting is a big part of the significance of Ethereum.

What is important about scripting in the context of Ethereum one of the things that makes Ethereum really potentially important is what could be built with it. The thing about Bitcoin and other cryptos is in solving a lot of currency problems it has made a platform that has a lot of other applications. The three fundamental characteristics I would define as secure, transparent, and decentralized. The blockchain (or global ledger of transactions) is essentially a database. A database that is difficult to hack, everyone can see the changes to, and a database no single entity controls.

Because of these features, people have tried to build stuff on top of the protocol. Smart property, distributed DNS with [Namecoin](http://namecoin.info/), distributed messaging with [Bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page), colored coins, decentralized autonomous corporations, a platform for distributing stocks, voting, and [my own proof of concept of a more consumer-friendly DRM system](https://github.com/aaron-lebo/dissent). The possibilities really are endless.

However, though the Bitcoin protocol can support these applications, it wasn't designed from the start to do so, and the developers in particular do not like the blockchain being used for non-currency applications. I also know in my own work that, for example, you can't easily query the entire blockchain using the official software, even tough it is there. In an example of Ethereum being friendly to applications, that will be possible.

Bitcoin as a technology as implemented also isn't especially friendly to hacking. The official implementation is C++, which isn't the easiest to jump into if you haven't done a lot of work with C++ (and I'm guessing a lot of Python, Javascript, Ruby devs haven't). Not to mention, it was never designed with hackability in mind, so if you are trying to come along later to add some feature, you better know what you are doing.

One thing that impresses me about Ethereum is that they are really focused on making it hackable, in the words of the whitepaper, even an ""average hacker"" should be able to write a client implementation. That is huge to me because it means more people will understand the protocol and it won't be some black magic and there should be more innovation. There already are implementations in several languages. In that same vein the design is modular, so it should be relatively easy to do something like swap out the proof of work function or such.

However, Ethereum of course at its heart is a currency. Even if it did not have the hackability or scripting capabilities there are features which I believe make it superior to Bitcoin.

* GHOST

Was made public by some developers in December. Bitcoin on average takes about 10 minutes to add blocks to the blockchain or to confirm transactions. This also means that it supports about 7 transactions a second. There are ways around this (no confirmation transactions), but in general this is problematic because you would not want to wait 10 minutes at the grocery store. 7 transactions a second is also not enough for a true global currency system.

GHOST takes advantage of the fact that when adding blocks to blockchain, numerous people are working on that. However, only the work of a single miner is actually used. As a result there is a lot of wasted work. GHOST uses that extra work.

They were quoting some absolutely crazy numbers like confirmations that took 1 second instead of 10 minutes with very high numbers of transactions per second. Ethereum uses a slightly toned down version of this for simplicity (again, going back to the idea that simplicity of implementation is just as important as optimizations), and I don't think they have give any exact numbers, but there is obviously a very high chance of improvement over Bitcoin.

* Dagger

Hashing functions are at the heart of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin uses SHA256 at the beginning of the network allowed even regular CPUs to mine for coins. However an arms race started. Soon only GPUs could effectively mine. Eventually, specialized machines called ASICs were manufactured and these days if you want to mine Bitcoin and get any reasonable return of investment, you have to buy ASICs which costs thousands of dollars.

The problem with this, aside from the fact that ""normal"" people can't mind is that mining equipment becomes centralized in the hands of a few. If 51% of the Bitcoin network was controlled my a single entity, we would no longer have a secure and trustable network.

To combat this, some other cryptos have tried different approaches. Litcoin uses scrypt which places much more importance on memory than SHA256, and as a result currently GPUs are the only way effectively mine, no ASICs. This is not guaranteed to continue into the future though.

Primecoin uses an interesting hashing algorithm which generates chains of prime numbers which could possibly have scientific applications in the future and currently only CPUs can mine.

Back to Dagger, which is what Ethereum uses, like scrypt is very memry based on so I believe the devs have stated makes even GPU mining difficult so we should see the main way to mine initially is via CPUs. However, like I said referencing scrypt, this is not guaranteed to always be the case. There has been [some talk](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1vh94e/dagger_updates/) about using a hybrid proof of work/proof of stake hybrid like Peercoin. What is the advantage of this? Proof of stake allows the network and mining to be done in a way which does not use computational cycles and therefore energy. Peercoin already is much more energy efficient than the Bitcoin network and would only be more so in the future. If something really did become a global currency and as energy-usage becomes more and more valuable in the future, this could be significant.

I want to be clear, the hybrid stuff is just discussion and I don't want to put any words in the mouths of the developers, but what it should -,ale clear is that devs are attentive thus far to issues, are knowledgeable, willing to do cutting-edge stuff, and the software itself is designed in a way to make change easy.
* linear inflation - Bitcoin has a hard limit of 21 million coins. This limit won't be reached until 2140, but due to this hard limit there is deflation as coins get lost or destroyed. Economics is not my forte so to avoid getting pwned by some expert I won't say too much, but it does seem obvious that this might encourage hoarding and gives early adopters great advantage.

Ethereum avoids this via linear inflation.

What I've been able to discern is that the way Ethereum will be launched is within the week there will be an official announcement and a fundraising period of 60 days will start. You will be able to pay an amount of Bitcoin and get a set amount of Ethereum back. A percentage of Ethereum generated through fundraising will go to the devs, a percentage will go to the foundation that will support Ethereum development long-term. They won't be able to spend this for a year and due to inflation after 5 years they will only have like 5% of the money supply from this fundraising so it isn't horrible.

I believe the test network is up. The actual network (the one worth money) will go live in several months which I guess will give time for nailing down the implementation, hype, and people to work on applications.

One last thing: I and others might be overly optimistic, but *if* the developers deliver on what they are saying, then this really should be Bitcoin 2.0. It will likely be superior in almost every way. Currently almost all alt coins or cryptocurrencies are small tweaks on Bitcoin like a different hashing function or faster confirmation times, etc. But with Ethereum we have something truly innovative.

This alone does not gaurantee success. Bitcoin has the advantage of network effects and sometimes superior technology does not win due to issues like this - [fyi, stop citing QWERTY and DVORAK it is actually not an example of this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.utdallas.edu%2F~liebowit%2Fkeys1.html&amp;ei=SQjgUt-xMbHKsQS3joDABQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMBpN3-nD9MDfD0mVReMJRR4eSfA&amp;sig2=NoO6DL5ok4NfhSvpLvmMhw&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.cWc). There is also the issue that a lot of people have something to lose if Bitcoin doesn't become ""the"" currency and so will fight tooth and nail to keep another crytpo from succeeding. Not to mention even Bitcoin hasn't seen widespread adoption, no gaurantee Ethereum will.

Despite all these things, if you are paying attention Ethereum is something special, and you might be at the start of something really big.

"Kindah interesting if things can have intrinsic value. Well, of course someone could say 'here is a pot of gold, one gold coin for each ethereal gold coin', but that aint exactly trustless!

Maybe shops can have 'vouchercoins' but i dont know how they would co-ordinate that. They would have a bigger surface area for customers to know they dont actually have the stock, and a 'shop run' is a different beast than a 'gold run'...(not sure if any better, but different :) )

Trustlessly, ether itself has intrinsic value *in* Ethereum, because it can be used to do transactions, have scripts with storage. [The dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflp7z1) suggests there are other ways to make intrinsic external to ethereum value be identifiable by ethereum, making it trustless.

I dont fully understand that code though, looks to me like every 100 blocks, someone can get ether by proving you have some random bit of the data? But that doesnt prove anyone else than the prover actually has access to it, and afaict people can actually compete for it.

I have different concept for the idea, the viewer puts some coin at stake in a script:

    //NOTE: currently PSUEDOCODE(still looking into the script itself..), even so CONTAINS HOLES
    
    command=tx.data[0] //What is being asked of the script.
    view_signature= tx.data[1]
    view_checksum = tx.data[2] //What data is being requested.
    view_timelimit= tx.data[3] //Limit before which things must happen.
    
    //constants: GRUDGE,REDEEM, grudge_cost,stake_holder_pubkey, 
    // redeem_difficulty, redeem_profit, VIEW_REQUEST
    
    //Server didnt get his shot at payment, because the viewer didnt send proof that
    // it was served. Server can punish by destroying coin on _both_ sides.
    //view_signature is now the signature of the request.
    if command = GRUDGE &amp;&amp; tx.value &gt;= grudge_cost &amp;&amp; block_number &lt; view_timelimit &amp;&amp;
       signature_belongs_to(stake_holder_pubkey, view_signature,
                            append(VIEW_REQUEST, view_checksum,view_timelimit)) :
       destroy_coins(2*tx.value)
       stop
    
    //Server wants to get the coin for serving it. To limit fees and not weigh down
    // the blockchain too much, he only has a probability.
    //view_signature is now the signature of the viewer telling the server he got
    // the gooods.
    if command = REDEEM &amp;&amp; block_number &lt; view_timelimit &amp;&amp; 
       checksum(append(view_checksum,block.parenthash)) &lt; redeem_difficulty &amp;&amp;
       signature_belongs_to(stake_holder_pubkey, view_signature,
                            append(VIEW_ACCEPTED, view_checksum,view_timelimit))
          send(tx.sender,redeem_reward)
          stop

     invalid //If you get here the transaction cant even get on the blockchain.

Basically after the server sends files, he gets a shot at getting paid, and if he doesnt, he has recourse, even though it costs both parties. You could tweak the ratio.. 

Note that it needs a starting time aswel, otherwise servers might just accept to serve when they happen to win the lotery.(it needs to be future checksums) A harder to solve problem is that the viewer himself may try to extract everything before miners get to it by making successful requests until he finds payouts. 

Servers would of course look at the script to establish its difficulty and payout, and if it contains enough coin in its balance.

Edit: also note that the server may get multiple attempts at winning the reward, you can calculate the probability and average payout, so no problem there. You could make it so that millions of views pass without payout; without *any* transaction occurring on the blockchain. Of course you want payouts to be small, but big relative to fees, but serving up data is really cheap.

Edit: of suppose you could combine this with the dropbox code to reward holding on to data even if no-one views it. Also note that the medium across which the data is accessed is not even in play in either script. Could be system where anyone can serve it up, where the cheapest methods win, that also depends on location of viewers.

"Afaik ethereum uses a key-value system. if you use `contract.storage[H(name_string)+k]=..stuff..`, the values of `k` you never set dont require storage.

Still i prefer the idea of a separate id-contract . However, the second contract doesnt seem neccessary because k∈{0,1} should be fine.

"""Tree of trust and reputation"" IPO model

Use personal trust and reputation to privilege people who are close connected to the project: Contributors, friends, community members, crypto gurus,... 
They get an invitation from the Ethereum team for the first round of a closed IPO with a special Ether price. Afterwards those people have the right to send invitations to people they think should be privileged for the next closed IPO round. Then another closed round and afterwards starts the public IPO. 

The Ether price will rise from round to round. So people who are close in the trust/reputation line to the Ethereum team get more Ether for their BTC as people who are further away or the general public. That way a whale cannot buy a dominating share (assuming Winklevoss&amp;co are not close friends to the Ether team or the next trust levels), and people who contributed a lot but dont have much money (or dont care so much about money) will get a fair share.

Example with some estimated values:
1. Round: Duration 3 days; 100 people invited; price 100k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 10 BTC per person so they hold 100M Ether and payed 1000 BTC.
2. Round: 4 days; 500 invitations sent from the 1. IPO round group; price 20k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 5 BTC / person so they hold 50M Ether and payed 2500 BTC.
3. Round: 7 days; 2000 friends from the 2. round group; price 5 000 Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 2 BTC / person so they hold 20M Ether and payed 4000 BTC.. 
Open to the public: 1. week: price 2 000 Ether for 1 BTC, then price moves slowly to 1000 ETH/BTC until the end of the IPO (6 weeks).

Even if a whale would spend 100k BTC he just gets 200M Ether in the public IPO. The people from the closed IPO rounds would hold 170M Ether (in the above example). 
All the variables (price, number of invitations, duration,...) need to be designed in a way that they produce a good equilibrium of fairness and incentive (not easy probably).

I think a cap is not needed and if so it could be done the way that it will not immediately stop the IPO but will close it in 3 days or so.

"That would imply an authentication. Otherwise how to see if somebody is US citizen or not? 
If they use authentication the ""whale"" problem would be solved as well. 
I dont like authentication much, but otherwise, nearly everybody accept authentication for trading BTC via exchanges as well, there is nearly no exchange out there without KYC style authentication.

It would create an inverse situation to BTC: 

In BTC early adopters got a lot of BTC with mining anonymously, today it is very hard to get BTC anonymously, most people buy them at an exchange and are tracked (company -&gt; state) that way.

With Ether all the investors would get tracked when there is an authentication scheme. But then miners and Ether buyers who use p2p exchanges would get their Ethers anonymously, assuming that with Ethereum we will get decentralized p2p exchanges. Also we can assume that there will be soon anonymizer tools, so even the fund raisers could ""wash"" their money by selling it to themself as anonymized buyer.

So at a result, I do not see much of a problem with authentication from a privacy perspective.
The government (switzerland if the org will be registered there) would have access to the list of fundraisers and their investments. But a fundraiser could sell his investment as soon Ethereum goes live and the tools for obtaining anonymity are in place. Nobody knows later on who is the owner of his investment.

Any other critical points about authentication?

1) Take the last 20 bytes of the sha3 hash of the RLP encoding of the transaction making the contract. If an account with that address already exists, exit. Otherwise, create the contract at that address

2) A contract is ""activated"" every time someone sends a transaction to it, at which point it runs its code, perhaps modifying its internal state or even sending some transactions, and then shuts down.

3) A contract is essentially an automated agent that lives on the Ethereum network, has an Ethereum address and balance, and can send and receive transactions.

3b) Storage - a persistent key/value store that is initially set to contain all zeroes, except for some script code inserted at the beginning when the contract is created as described above. Keys and values in storage are integers in the range [0 ... 2^256-1]

&gt;

&gt;In [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and [marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing), **product differentiation** (or simply differentiation) is the process of distinguishing a [product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business\)) or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular [target market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market). This involves differentiating it from [competitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition)' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by [Edward Chamberlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Chamberlin) in his 1933 Theory of Monopolistic Competition.

&gt;

&gt;**Ethernet** /ˈiːθərnɛt/ is a family of [computer networking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) technologies for [local area networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) (LANs). Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 and standardized in 1983 as [IEEE 802.3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3).  Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as [token ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring), [FDDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface), and [ARCNET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCNET).

&gt;The [Ethernet standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ethernet_standards) comprise several wiring and signaling variants of the [OSI physical layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer) in use with Ethernet. The original [10BASE5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5) Ethernet used [coaxial cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable) as a [shared medium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_medium). Later the coaxial cables were replaced with [twisted pair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair) and [fiber optic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber) links in conjunction with [hubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub) or [switches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_switch). Data rates were periodically increased from the original 10 [megabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabits) per second to 100 [gigabits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabits) per second.

&gt;Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called [frames](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking\)). Each frame contains source and destination addresses and error-checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted. As per the [OSI model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) Ethernet provides services up to and including the [data link layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer).

"I don't want to discourage longterm thinking about the DAOogles of the future, but as we are not there just yet, I was hoping to keep one foot on the ground for a moment.  There is great value in thinking about and writing Ethereum contracts that make use of the turing completeness and the crypto primitives to perform complex operations under the watchful gaze of the blockchain.  Still, I think you wave your hands a bit carelessly when you state:
""we no longer care if Alice is a cousin of Bernie, or the devil himself, provided the devil responds to 
incentives and knows how to invest. We don't need to trust them at all."" 
There are of course incentives that live off the blockchain and outside the ethereum economy.  Knowing how to invest is different from executing on that knowledge.  But, if you were not intending to tread on the territory of how meatspace might actually interact with the perfect mathematical crystals of interlocking ethereal contracts, then perhaps I am commenting on the wrong thread.  If by ""investment fund"" you mean some delegation of authority by owners of physical assets to a manager, and the redistribution of real returns from the holding, buying and selling of physical assets, then I think you need to consider the flesh and blood part of the equation.  For example, bringing gold into the ethereum investment universe at some point requires a warehouseman.  She hires guards with big guns to keep the assets safe.  And even though she may issue receipts for that gold in accounts of ethereal splendor, when those guards grow sleepy or are bought off, the value of those receipts will likely drop, suddenly and unhappily.  
Now, I do realize that it is possible to fantasize about a world in which no gold can leave or enter the warehouse without a smart contract insisting on a full accounting, and the weighing machinery itself is protected from false measure by another smart contract tied to a measure judged honest by the consensus of a distributed crowd, etc., etc..  I myself am more interested in what ethereum might be able to do within the sadly flawed world I wake up in each morning.  In this world, delegating portfolio trading authority to Alice IS trusting Alice, and this is a feature of that particular relationship, not a flaw.  I hope other, less rewarding, delegations in day-to-day life can be contracted away.  The ultimate questions are not ""how do we get rid of all trust relationships"" but ""how do we best (most efficiently) move the trust to the activities that are most productive, and make those trusted activities auditable.

However, if it was donations they were seeking, I'd put in $100, even if I wasn't getting any ether or return back. That's more money for the devs that they can use however they want.

&gt; Also what happens when the donation drive fails, then ethereum has to come back with the IPO model.

Very valid. I framed it that way but another thing is if you felt confident enough with the donation scheme you could just rely on that and not even have the fallback.

But it could just be a way to test the waters. Some Kickstarters (not technically donations) raise hundreds of thousands or millions more than expected. I don't think that is a crazy possibility, and again, these would be donations, so the devs would get 100%, not the cut they are looking at now.

But running a simple little script is part of every transaction, and if they open things up, you'll be able to do somewhat more complicated transactions. (Kickstarter-style pledge drives is one example.)

The ethereum devs believe they've figured out a way to build a full-fledged programming language into their coin, and have strong security for it. This would allow all sorts of new features to be added by anyone, just by writing scripts instead of modifying the client and getting everybody to upgrade.

Having a full programming language means someone could write an infinite loop (doing the same thing over and over forever) and lock everybody's client. So the script has to pay as it goes for the computation it's doing.

However, i cant help but wonder, in PoS, staking('mining') alternative blocks comes at no cost, there is another side to that aswel; you can have many chains... And afaics Slashers system of avoiding people pushing incorrect blocks would still work, excepting the time-interval thing.

And pure PoS systems have to deal with the time-interval issue somehow too, and if just one of the chains uses PoW, they can lockstep all the other chains with that, i reckon..

(Of course with PoW, multiple chains would divide work(hashing) power, and it would be easier to put the attack onto one chain. Rewarding the more difficult mining more would only change the tactic of the attacker towards trying to move around the difficulty until he ends up with the most work-power in a block.)

Section 2. [**Trust metric**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato#Trust_metric) of article  [**Advogato**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advogato): 

---

&gt;The motivating idea for Advogato was to try out in practice Levien's ideas about attack resistant [trust metrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_metric), having users certify each other in a kind of [peer review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) process and use this information to avoid the abuses that plague open community sites. Levien observed that his notion of attack resistant trust metric was fundamentally very similar to the [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm used by [Google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) to rate article interest. In the case of Advogato, the trust metric is designed to include all individuals who could reasonably be considered members of the Free Software and Open Source communities while excluding others.

so we can be assured no one is cheating

&gt; What sort of rules?

rules that can be programmed using etherscript

To reiterate: currently, there are no apps that use the identity info in a way that needs to be verifiably enforced.

The gist of what I'm saying is that whenever you need to transfer data between (into) chains, you end up needing to bundle both chain softwares together, else use a trusted source of that chain (you have to trust that data). Having verifiable rules based off that info is not feasible.

The beauty of ethereum is that you can *reuse* applications and *securely link* relationships between them. Once you get data into the ether, you have the assurance not only *that* contract can act on the data, but, if stored, other contracts can, as well. There is no disjoint part. There is no need to rely on trusted queries.

"From my perspective, any new technical solution seeking to assist in developing countries needs to address actual (not perceived) problems with accessible solutions. While technical solutions to problems may assist in addressing those problems, they need to be humble enough to understand why and how to market themselves. For example, it is often cited that Africa has leapfrogged legacy infrastructure requirements in land based telecommunications. This is, more or less true, but it is likely a factor of corporate incentives to provide services to predominantly oral societies that has driven this rather than any particular love of a Nokia 6100. It also has some disadvantages because reliable broadband into homes, even in a town like Nairobi, still requires land based infrastructure and providing any level of comprehensive solutions, like APIs for mobile money systems, is exceedingly complicated because the IP is owned by corporations who have no interest in adopting standards. 

How does this apply to the Ethereum project? From my perspective, Ethereum projects which seek to provide solutions in developing countries will need to address a number of factors. First, while there may not be as much legacy legal infrastructure, as with legacy landlines, these legacy systems can have advantages. That said they can be easily corrupted. Ethereum can only address one of the two challenges which legal system users in the real world face. Ethereum will allow users to avoid debates upon interpretation of agreements (these mean that). However, the other major reason legal disputes in the transactional space occur is because there is a dispute over whether a particular event in the real world occurred or not. Ethereum, as a block chain technology, cannot address these. It can provide a framework to begin working towards a contracting methodology of trust reduced proof of real world events, but that is about the best it can achieve in the medium term. 

My point is that technological solutions, even the most elegant ones, do come at a cost and are never perfect. 

What Ethereum could provide users with, though, is certainty with respect to how transactions will operate and how disputes over whether a real world event occurred will be resolved. This is a game changer, but it applies to developing countries no more nor less than anywhere else. Many developing countries may have less developed formal rule of law systems, but they still have rule frameworks in which commercial transactions operate which can be just as sophisticated as legal rules passed by a parliament. So, in my opinion, the competition with other rule frameworks is not *necessarily* lower but it is slightly different. 

Second, people often assume that citizens of developing countries are somehow more willing to embrace change to existing ways and means, but as development economists have more or less shown, the opposite is actually true. People closer to the poverty line have a stronger resistance to change than those in the middle class. To succeed in developing countries, Ethereum projects will likely need to abstract away the brilliant technology behind what is happening and just provide things that work. 

Lastly, any Ethereum project looking to succeed needs to market themselves well. Simply building great stuff is not enough. But marketing well requires time, knowledge, and presence. So time will tell what happens.

&gt;

&gt;In [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and [marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing), **product differentiation** (or simply differentiation) is the process of distinguishing a [product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business\)) or service from others, to make it more attractive to a particular [target market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market). This involves differentiating it from [competitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition)' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by [Edward Chamberlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Chamberlin) in his 1933 Theory of Monopolistic Competition.

Scalability is of course a concern in Bitcoin as well as ethereum. Bitcoin has been very conservative with the transaction limits imposed in the 1 mb block size.  And yet for all of Bitcoin's popularity, the scalability limits are not really an issue yet.

"""Tree of trust and reputation"" IPO model

Use personal trust and reputation to privilege people who are close connected to the project: Contributors, friends, community members, crypto gurus,... 
They get an invitation from the Ethereum team for the first round of a closed IPO with a special Ether price. Afterwards those people have the right to send invitations to people they think should be privileged for the next closed IPO round. Then another closed round and afterwards starts the public IPO. 

The Ether price will rise from round to round. So people who are close in the trust/reputation line to the Ethereum team get more Ether for their BTC as people who are further away or the general public. That way a whale cannot buy a dominating share (assuming Winklevoss&amp;co are not close friends to the Ether team or the next trust levels), and people who contributed a lot but dont have much money (or dont care so much about money) will get a fair share.

Example with some estimated values:
1. Round: Duration 3 days; 100 people invited; price 100k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 10 BTC per person so they hold 100M Ether and payed 1000 BTC.
2. Round: 4 days; 500 invitations sent from the 1. IPO round group; price 20k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 5 BTC / person so they hold 50M Ether and payed 2500 BTC.
3. Round: 7 days; 2000 friends from the 2. round group; price 5 000 Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 2 BTC / person so they hold 20M Ether and payed 4000 BTC.. 
Open to the public: 1. week: price 2 000 Ether for 1 BTC, then price moves slowly to 1000 ETH/BTC until the end of the IPO (6 weeks).

Even if a whale would spend 100k BTC he just gets 200M Ether in the public IPO. The people from the closed IPO rounds would hold 170M Ether (in the above example). 
All the variables (price, number of invitations, duration,...) need to be designed in a way that they produce a good equilibrium of fairness and incentive (not easy probably).

I think a cap is not needed and if so it could be done the way that it will not immediately stop the IPO but will close it in 3 days or so.

If the IPO generated too much BTC, donate it to some organisations like Wikileaks, EFF,…

"Contracts are busy doing all sorts of trustless stuff, which may include locking up ethers and definitely precludes just suiciding. Hell, some of them dont even have owners.

Even if they could be drained, this would make it entirely trustful that the owner sets up the thing the same way.

NameReg doesnt have one.(edit: an owner, i mean) Or does it? Better go check :p Seriously though, in principle it doesnt need an owner.

*A* solution is not a burn-over but basically just forking it and having everyone switch at the same block.

Cant really copy the contracts and burn over the rest either; people anticipating it would stuff everything in a contract that pays them back later. Then it gets copied, they collect the ethers from the contract on both chains, and then burn to double their money.

Hmm, perhaps you can solve that.. you copy over the money and contracts like a fork any, and then also have burn over.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Asymptote***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote) : 

---

&gt;

&gt;In analytic geometry, an **asymptote** (/ˈæsɪmptoʊt/) of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors. In some contexts, such as algebraic geometry, an asymptote is defined as a line which is tangent to a curve at infinity.

&gt;The word asymptote is derived from the Greek ἀσύμπτωτος (asumptotos) which means ""not falling together,"" from ἀ priv. + σύν ""together"" + πτωτ-ός ""fallen."" The term was introduced by Apollonius of Perga in his work on conic sections, but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.

&gt;There are potentially three kinds of asymptotes: horizontal, vertical and oblique asymptotes. For curves given by the graph of a function y = ƒ(x), horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function appro ...

"For what it's worth, here's what /u/adam3us (Adam Back) had to say about how this affects Ethereum in another thread:

&gt; It should be possible to replicate ethereum fuctionality, or actually fork ethereum FOSS code itself, replace ether with real bitcoin (via the 2-way peg) and run it on a side-chain. If a feature coin can run on a 2-way peg (and its secure &amp; useful) it will be forked and 2-way pegged.  
  
&gt; New law of crypto currency: if it can be 2-way pegged, the project does not need its own alt. If it has its own alt anyway, it will be forked and replaced with bitcoin.  
  
&gt; This is not a new problem, but it highlights the natural limit on profitability and self-defeating nature of alt-shares that try to premine all or part the transactional currrency: any user past a moderately succesful level of use will fork and replace the premined transactional currency. Replacing the currency with bitcoin is neutral and fair. It is just not plausible to imagine a few early speculators owning the entire transactional currency for the world.  
  
&gt; Bitcoin itself is different, its &gt; 50% disbursed, electrically efficiently, and was a genuine ultra high risk speculation in the first few years when most of the disbursement happened. People who mine bitcoin now are not getting rich. Ownership is wide. Anyone can choose any investment level. There is a natural (decentralized) monopoly for durable engineered scarcity (bitcoin), advantages are strong for everyone to use it. Its definitional: if another me-too scarcity displaced bitcoin, neither bitcoin nor the newcoin would be viewed as durable. Starting new scarcity races for feature coins is self-defeating as a funding model with no other feature outside of the source, it can and will be forked if it gets use. Starting new scarcity races is also grossly unfair, coins should have a reason for existence, and making the param-tweaker rich is not a reason.

"There are some similarities: i) Both are the products of for-profit companies, i.e. companies trying to promote their ideas to make money.

Just look at the risk/reward ratio and it is way out of line, bordering on insanity. Hubris and Greed comes to mind. If you were the world's greatest cook and asked a venture capitalist or businessman to fund your new restaurant, Guess who makes the most money? Whoever takes the most risk. That's the guy who is paying for the risk out of his own pocket. It's been that way since the beginning of time. Granted, if you have risked a lot of your time and mental energy, you deserve payment for assuming that risk of your time and potential energy as sweat equity.
This is the only project that I have ever heard of that the founders have no sweat equity, no equity in capital and want all the rewards before the business even opens and then will ask the investment community to fund the entire project before it even starts and assume all of the risk.

"You *should* link to the [issuance model](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper#wiki-currency-and-issuance). X ether is bought, total of 0.5X goes to others. 0.225X would be time-locked, probably with a script, so verfiably so. 

0.4X is mined per year, the premine is very acceptable. 

I think the developpers ether share is a little high. They could vary the issuance to themselves as dependent of the ammount of BTC-bought. Idea being that the larger the community, the smaller the fraction of that community is developpers, so their share should be smaller. Also, the ammount of ether bought is an indicator for the potential success of ethereum, so the more is bought, the more ethers are kindah worth, and so the smaller the fraction is to provide some level of value. (The expectation of value of the premine should aways increase with buy-in)

If they want more ether, developpers could buy ether by donating BTC to some charities or something.(dont burn BTC for this purpose, it's silly)

Forks... Well afaik there is no way around it. This is why we basically need to try keep users of cryptocurrencies somehow focussed on developpers and knowledgable people. The lame-ass clones of course shows that a few of them can be convinced, but the effect looks larger than it is if you look at volumes.

There are also 'friendly forks'. Eventually a bitcoin2 or Ethereum2 would be made, I mean i find it hard to believe that there wont ever be a need for that. I always throught such followups should involve the possibility of burning coins in the older version to get them in the newer one.

"I'm not an expert on it. I can say this: Bitcoin has limited scripting, which can't do everything a normal programming language can do. Bitcoin did that on purpose for security reasons. And even the limited scripting it has is mostly locked down because they don't much trust it. But running a simple little script is part of every transaction, and if they open things up, you'll be able to do somewhat more complicated transactions. (Kickstarter-style pledge drives is one example.)

The ethereum devs believe they've figured out a way to build a full-fledged programming language into their coin, and have strong security for it. This would allow all sorts of new features to be added by anyone, just by writing scripts instead of modifying the client and getting everybody to upgrade.

Having a full programming language means someone could write an infinite loop (doing the same thing over and over forever) and lock everybody's client. So the script has to pay as it goes for the computation it's doing.

"The problem with any discussion in the cryptocurrency space is the prevalence of Austrian-school terminology, and the general confusion as to what deflation and inflation mean.

Just to avoid confusion, let's use inflation/deflation to refer to price changes strictly, without talking about the quantity of money available.

So what does it mean to say that Ethereum (or Bitcoin) is deflationary? The argument goes something like this; the supply of money is increasing linearly (or sublinearly), but the demand for money is exponential, as more goods appear, and the number of people increase.  Therefore, over time, the value of money will increase, thus leading to deflation.

The problem with this argument is the claim about the growth of the supply of money.  This is only true with an incredibly restrictive definition of money supply; basically limited to M0.  Even there, M0 is no good since it includes ""guaranteed"" deposits (usually with a central bank).  So really, we're making the claim that the money supply is equivalent to the supply of specie.

The problem is that the actual amount of money circulating in an economy is a market phenomenon, because metrics of money supply have to take into account credit markets.  At the moment, neither Ethereum nor Bitcoin have even rudimentary credit markets, so this is not as much of a factor.

But if either coin is successful, credit markets will evolve -- people with money will seek to increase their money by purchasing cash-like instruments (demand deposits, savings accounts, bonds, stocks, real estate); which allows the actual specie to circulate, while simultaneously allowing them to ""keep"" the money based on the liquidity of the instruments, and earning interest on the money in the meantime.

So, in short, I don't buy the argument that either coin is deflationary.  At best we can say that it is long-term deflationary, but even there we need a ridiculous number of assumptions to make that claim.",0,t1_cgegzwo,t3_21l7rw,t3_21l7rw,False,,2,False,,1433112816,1396043050,andrewla,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,cgegzwo,True,0
"Wait a second here - and please forgive me as I'm *very* new to all of this.  In fact, if I'm missing something here please tell me.

The fact that a ""company"" wouldn't remain in business due to scrutiny makes sense.  But we're talking about easy to write, simple to duplicate scripts that could be directed at ripping someone off.

Let's say someone says there is a contract/service that will put incoming money into an escrow account or protect it in some way.  As a developer I'm very familiar with conditional branches and I'm just as familiar with the difficulty humans have in following conditionals - especially when math or edge cases crop up.

I believe in open source code and your arguments are used in support of it.  However I get the impression that these contracts are more like snippets of JavaScript, written for specific applications.  People used to trust these snippets because they were designed for a very specific purpose, but even though the source was plainly available they generally weren't reviewed by any number of people.  Remember all the extra bullshit people had inadvertently placed on their MySpace profiles when that was popular?  A huge proportion of users cannot or *will* not read even the most rudimentary code snippets.

The difference between Amazon and some scammer using Ethereum is that Amazon would be gutted alive by the legal system, has reputation to lose, and would almost certainly be subject to reversal of charges if the contracts were found to be misleading.  For non-technical users, /u/loveopenly has a valid point.

Peercoin with its proof of state setup already is more energy efficient than Bitcoin and going forward if the network grew would become even more so.

I saw in another post of yours that you said that proof of stake is difficult to have linear inflation with. I do know Peercoin does have inflation, though I am not especially educated on the topic and linear inflation might not be the same thing.

Based on just the title of the Slasher link I guess you are already thinking and have thought about this. My question would be is there any desire to get proof of stake into Ethereum and if it was not in at launch would it be something which could be added later?

&gt;

&gt;In [cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and [computer science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) a **hash tree** or **Merkle tree** is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the [hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) of the labels of its children nodes. Hash trees are useful because they allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of larger data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of [hash lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_list) and [hash chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain).

&gt;Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of the given hash tree requires processing an amount of data proportional to the [logarithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) of the number of nodes of the tree;  this contrasts with hash lists, where the amount is proportional to the number of nodes. The concept is named after [Ralph Merkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle).

As far as verification is concerned, the cost of running scripts is not less than verifying if the hash found by another passes the difficulty test. In the Ethereum whitepaper it says there's a block time of 60 seconds.

The fees become cheaper as the total processing power of the network grows, but this says nothing about the processing power of individual nodes. Cheaper fees means more and longer scripts on the block-chain. There can come a point where so much code needs to be executed to be able to verify a block that slower miners can't keep up.

"Never realized that you could! At least for the burning of subcurrencies/ether. Not entirely sure if the economics of burning is sensible, afaik burn-over only makes sense if the intention is really to transfer activity. The transfer seems to be the wrong way :)

But you call it BtcEth, but how do you subsequently relate it to bitcoins?

One scenario: (edited for clarity) Both sides need clients on both bitcoin and ethereum.

* You(Y) want BTC from ether you buy BtcEths from the contract.(or rather, its just ethers that are locked up to ensure presence)
* Some person P wants ethers for BTC and requests a trade. (could be later or before)
* Software on Y's client notices this and gives indication that it is online.
* P chooses from online clients that want BTC, and sets up a bitcoin transaction dependent on H(S), and revealing H(S)
* Y(and possible) sets up ether released upon knowing S.(based on H(S)
* P releases the ether transactions towards him, revealing S. Then Y(and others) use S to release the transactions paying them BTC.

Really, though, it is all about communication here. P is really just looking for offerings, concensus is only needed for the 'upon-release' transactions.

Edit: Not sure, perhaps it *really* helps; i mean the BtcEths contract can provide a stick that people dont lie about wanting BTC. Still, i think maybe communication between clients knowing adresses like that needs to be made somewhat easy too?

I won't lie, I'd like to see everything dialectically flipped: crypto-*un*-currencies, automation of market-bypassed production, relentless social use-need matching... Ethereum, to my knowledge, seems to be the only project that verges toward this side of the wider project, in demonstrating that it takes the trouble of devising a Turing-complete language, emphasising the architecture (potentiality) over unimaginative applications (actuality) of the blockchain, and attempting to define smart-contracts/DAOs—however problematical. It's a material fact that ever more sophisticated forms of automation or smart-contracts now exist, and all we can say for certain is that it's “for better or worse”, yet by the same token, present itself as an opportunity, in *resembling* a project with traction on social formations to come.

"I think I understand what you mean. I believe the complete opposite, I think Ethereum is going to reduce scams if not eliminate them altogether. 

First, it's currently impossible to obfuscate contract code, so all contracts will be in clear text. Anyone pretending to create a contract and not delivering on its promise (frontend/backend schism) would be immediately flagged a scam both by the users of the said site AND on chain. Just like if amazon kept 33% of the credit card numbers to buy themselves fancy paintings, I think we'd know. Ethereum is about to add decentralized, Sybil attack proof reputation systems on top of all that. 

Second, in order to be trustless and decentralized most if not all contracts of an 'escrow' nature would have to have 100% if not more collaterals attached to them, on both sides. Hard to scam if users automatically get their money back.

Third unlike the financial derivates in today's financial world, derivatives in Ethereum would be backed by Ether, or even Bitcoin, and not debt. Good as gold.

Fourth Ethereum makes the building of such services so trivial than consumers will never have been in such a powerful position to 'vote with their feet'. Worrying that someone could scam others with Ethereum is the same as worrying that someone could ask for a cc number on a website today, then disappear the day after. Ethereum will create an ecosystem where anyone acting without proper escrows, total transparency and 100% honesty will be out of business in no time.

"From my perspective, any new technical solution seeking to assist in developing countries needs to address actual (not perceived) problems with accessible solutions. While technical solutions to problems may assist in addressing those problems, they need to be humble enough to understand why and how to market themselves. For example, it is often cited that Africa has leapfrogged legacy infrastructure requirements in land based telecommunications. This is, more or less true, but it is likely a factor of corporate incentives to provide services to predominantly oral societies that has driven this rather than any particular love of a Nokia 6100. It also has some disadvantages because reliable broadband into homes, even in a town like Nairobi, still requires land based infrastructure and providing any level of comprehensive solutions, like APIs for mobile money systems, is exceedingly complicated because the IP is owned by corporations who have no interest in adopting standards. 

How does this apply to the Ethereum project? From my perspective, Ethereum projects which seek to provide solutions in developing countries will need to address a number of factors. First, while there may not be as much legacy legal infrastructure, as with legacy landlines, these legacy systems can have advantages. That said they can be easily corrupted. Ethereum can only address one of the two challenges which legal system users in the real world face. Ethereum will allow users to avoid debates upon interpretation of agreements (these mean that). However, the other major reason legal disputes in the transactional space occur is because there is a dispute over whether a particular event in the real world occurred or not. Ethereum, as a block chain technology, cannot address these. It can provide a framework to begin working towards a contracting methodology of trust reduced proof of real world events, but that is about the best it can achieve in the medium term. 

My point is that technological solutions, even the most elegant ones, do come at a cost and are never perfect. 

What Ethereum could provide users with, though, is certainty with respect to how transactions will operate and how disputes over whether a real world event occurred will be resolved. This is a game changer, but it applies to developing countries no more nor less than anywhere else. Many developing countries may have less developed formal rule of law systems, but they still have rule frameworks in which commercial transactions operate which can be just as sophisticated as legal rules passed by a parliament. So, in my opinion, the competition with other rule frameworks is not *necessarily* lower but it is slightly different. 

Second, people often assume that citizens of developing countries are somehow more willing to embrace change to existing ways and means, but as development economists have more or less shown, the opposite is actually true. People closer to the poverty line have a stronger resistance to change than those in the middle class. To succeed in developing countries, Ethereum projects will likely need to abstract away the brilliant technology behind what is happening and just provide things that work. 

Lastly, any Ethereum project looking to succeed needs to market themselves well. Simply building great stuff is not enough. But marketing well requires time, knowledge, and presence. So time will tell what happens. 

For my part, I remain very optimistic about the possibilities Ethereum will provide, but for me those possibilities remain more in the area of automating complex tasks than in replacing rule frameworks... at least in the short and medium term.",0,t1_ch6ql48,t3_24b3aa,t3_24b3aa,False,,2,False,,1433602166,1398933712,compleatang,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,ch6ql48,True,0
"I don't get why people dislike premise. I believe that un fact, calling it a ""pre-mine"" and a ""scam"" is a misunderstanding of the very reason that mining exists. Mining isn't a random puzzle whose sole purpose is to give free money to people with good computer, hashing is a necessary part of a PoW blockchain and Block Rewards are incentives for people to cover the resources to run that network, which also helps solve the distribution problem.

Let's consider the alternative, where instead the Foundation runs a charity drive and releases the code with ether going purely to the miners.


* The initial funds would be significantly smaller, since the backers get effectively no return.

* There would be much less money to hire more talented developers, so the project would be executed by volunteers

* Since Ether is necessary for development, part of the money of the initial campaign would necessarily go to buy Ether from miners at market value (in fact a market would be the first app that would need to be developed)

* The real financial incentive would be to mine. Even if you have a powerful computer and coding skills, you would probably gain more by using your development machine into a mining rig.

* There is less transparency of how the money is used, and no part on it will be locked into a contract. AFAIK part of the ether reward for the developers will be locked into a vesting contract so they will not be able to sell it for a few years.

* This isn't 2009: there are lots of Mine by Night groups, people that are ready to mine in any new coin to get some of it, without any real stake on the development, they could mine Ethereum today and scam coin tomorrow if it's more profitable.

"&gt;You dwell *as* an example in your favor. :-p

I don't understand this, sorry! 

You understand bitcoin better than I, and probably Ethereum too. The complexity I was feeling uncomfortable with was not the scripting - that can, *I hope*, only screw up an application. 

My concern was intuitive, and about flaws in the foundation of Ethereum, such as in what to use for various parameters, and how seemingly innocuous choices about these could have very unexpected effects. I'm thinking chaos theory here, and I think it is naive to expect order and predictability in what will become a very large and complex system. 

Perhaps bitcoin is not that much simpler. I haven't studied the code, or the scripting language. A brief look at that in Ethereum is what made me concerned. 

Creating multiple independent implementations, and other validation techniques are admirable, but there are no methods of conventional software development that can eliminate vulnerabilities of the kind I'm suggesting, in a conventional software system. 

In my scenario, all you can do is make the *system* as a *whole,* robust when things go wrong in unanticipated ways. Biological systems: DNA/evolutionary genetics, cells, organs, organisms, families, communities, ecosystems, GAIA, etc are examples of how to do this. 

You can throw a massive asteroid at GAIA, and she will probably survive. Take out large numbers of humans, or throw a brand new pandemic disease at humanity, and our species would survive, with or without a neocortex and millennia of medical cultural knowledge. Hence my interest in MaidSafe.

You made the point that evolution is slow, but this is not necessarily the case. In the context of finding highly optimised solutions, to very large complex problems, evolution is very efficient, very many times more efficient than random search. Nature is highly optimised for speed as well as resilience, so if the domain calls for this kind of solution, an evolutionary system may well be fast as well as robust. It depends on the complexity of the space being explored. 

However, it may not need to be evolutionary to be resilient, as one could design for a stable environment with known boundary conditions, and create a stable solution modelled on a biologically system for a similar domain. The design process may or may not use an evolution engine, depending on the complexity of the design space.

"See, that's the problem; I don't think that way. If there's one question that keeps me awake at night, it's the thought that perhaps everything I've sank my life into for the past 3 years is a technological and ideological dead end, and perhaps traditional centralized institution-based mechanisms based around corporations and banks and governments and incremental innovation respecting the existing establishment are actually the best way for society to move forward in solving the issues that really matter for the majority of people.

For what it's worth, I am very confident that the crypto behind Ethereum is fine from a technical standpoint, and that we have the skills to do it.

"I think if we're going to solve the ""voting online securely"" issue it's definitely going to come from a Bitcoin-inspired protocol. My hope is this will happen on Ethereum. But for now I'm very cautiously optimistic. I think there will be plenty of opportunities to test whether this will work or not, before we actually start using such a system in countries for voting.

If someone does try to make such a system, I hope they go with [range/score voting](http://rangevoting.org/). I've looked into the various types of voting a little, and range voting seems the most fair, and the one most likely one to determine the best candidate out of a race. 

I also think it forces us to think a little more rationally about the candidates in order to give them the proper ""grade"", rather than the very emotionally charged voting that we see now, with people voting Democrat because ""I'm a Democrat"", so I should support ""my team"", rather than who he thinks is the best candidate for the job overall.

With score voting you decide exactly how much a candidate is worth compared to others. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate the emotional factor (you could still give your favorite one a 9, and all the others a 0), but I think it does force you to think about it a little more than the ""white or black"" options we often see today in voting, and I believe it forces people to be more ""fair"" when giving each a score. 

Then we should see candidates that really deserve to win, because most people have a great opinion about them and think they will do a good/great job, rather than someone winning just because 51 percent hate the other candidate, even if they don't like this one that much either, and with minority candidates having zero chance in such a race, even if most people think they would be great (but they have to vote *strategically* for Big Party B, so they don't let Big Party A win).

Since the calculations will be done securely on the blockchain and automatically, it might finally be feasible and no harder than choosing any other voting system. 

If range voting is too complicated for some reason to do on a blockchain, because of its consensus mechanism, then [approval voting](http://www.electology.org/approval-voting) is the next best one, which is like a more simplistic version of the range voting. However, it's less accurate, because you ""approve"" several candidates *equally*, instead of giving them a fair grade. But it should still be a pretty good voting system, and I wouldn't mind seeing both compete in the voting market.

Rank voting is much worse than both, and I don't think it even deserves pursuing. It already exists in some countries like Australia I think, and it doesn't do a very good job at picking the right candidate, because it forces the decision to still be highly strategic (not a good thing).",0,t1_cfmi7uj,t3_1yp1nr,t3_1yp1nr,1393173860,,4,False,,1432521552,1393159653,[deleted],0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,4,,cfmi7uj,True,0

"Actually in the grand web 3.0 scheme, I'm not sure that tracking the cosign accounts in a contract (ie in the blockchain) is the right way to do it.

The user should also be able to sync his ""wallet storage"" content on whatever device he use.

But as the blockchain is a very expensive storage I feel that the data shouldn't be redundant. My idea was that if voter A and D said `yes`, and voters B, C and E hasn't voted yet we could encode that state as `10010`. Then if voter B says `yes` we simply use the bitwise OR `|= 01000` so the new state will be `11010`. But 1/ counting the `1` would require some kind of recursive functions, and 2/ I don't know how to implement the reject operation (do we need it?).

"We will be releasing a huge amount of information in advance of the pre-sale.  All of your questions will be answered in great detail, hopefully to your satisfaction.

That said, I can answer a couple of your issues briefly.

The bulk of the pre-mine is a long-term endowment for the project.  Employee compensation and other expenses will be paid in combinations of ETH, BTC and legacy currency to be specified by the employee.  Most personnel are eager to receive a significant percentage of ETH as part of their regular compensation.  We will be running a radically open and transparent organization.  For instance, salaries will be formula-based and the formula will be published.

The long-term endowment will be released in tranches that are in time-locked contracts.

If you are holding ETH, it would be in your best interest if the company and its personnel were also holding ETH, and were actively working to increase the value of ETH.  Through this mechanism our interests are further aligned.


&gt; We have to trust you will do the right thing with those funds.

You also have to trust us to do the right thing with the BTC used to purchase ETH in the pre-sale.  Not sure how the pre-mine ETH requires more or different trust.

&gt; under what jurisdiction will the foundation operate under?  

&gt; Will a government who is bothered by Ethereum or any of its contracts/DACs go ahead and close the foundation thus hiting a hard blow?

Ethereum will have hubs in many places around the world.  Two major hubs will be in Switzerland and Canada. If either of those jurisdictions turns against cryptocurrencies, the organization will relocate that hub.  

&gt; To me this looks too centralized.

"No I'm not. There are choices made in implementations, tradeoffs between moral actions and profit-driven or self-promoting or control-securing actions. Things could be done morally and for the public good, and they can also be done solely for profit. Facebook had many opportunities to protect their users' information, or to try to be more democratic in their organization, or where their profit goes. Apple can choose who produces their goods, how open their software is, where their profit goes, whatever. For comparison, Wikipedia (or Wikimedia) has a pretty solid model of trying to be moral.

There's a trade-off here of whether people are purely profit-driven, or if they want to build something productive for the public to use. Right now the people behind ethereum could be profit-driven, they could try to get as much out of it at they can, at the expense of the functionality and at the expense of the public benefit of the protocol. If they wanted to make as much money as they can, then maybe it's better for them to step aside and have some other people implement the protocol.

To be clear, I'm not seriously advocating that they step aside, and this profit-seeking tradeoff is usually a line somewhere in the middle of the extremes.

"Accessing just the current hash would achieve what you say.(edit: afaict it is best to choose as random seed something that is result of each mining attempt, am i wrong? in that view..) There is no 'arms race' as the computing power for running the contracts has to be in range of the full nodes, and this is easily in range for any the miners interested in an attack like this.

Miners can still just win a block, and then not send it on the network if it doesnt suit their (paying clients)bets. Worse, they can monitor the network and only send winning blocks if they are , they then still have a shot at the block reward.

Tried to look at it in depth [here](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/630/contracts-affecting-miner-behavior), tbh i dont think it is a particularly successful analysis.

* For repeated N bets the standard deviation is σ≈sqrt(N)⋅p⋅(1-p) i.e. it keeps going up even for many small bets, so many small bets could add up to incentive to miner collusion.

* I dont really know how miners and betters come together to create their devious schemes. Certainly when there is a single big player and big miner you should be worried. How the big player pays out to third parties might also be important. (if small miners can use that) The size of income that the colluder can rake in depends on who he can create trustful/trustless relations with.

* The commitment scheme can completely protect parties, if failing to provide the random value committed to implies losing accordingly. That approach can be inconvenient.

* Just realized that a *single* contract succeeding at getting non-influencable, non-predictable result would solve the problem for everyone.

* Say block reward is **B** *plain* dropping can be done when **&lt;w&gt; &gt; B + h**, where **h** is the current bet winnings and **&lt;w&gt;** the expected ones.

* Dropping where you watch the network and have a probability **p** to get in your block if you enter it at the last minute, seeing a competitor that implies winnings **c**, you allow the competitor when **c &gt; B+h**, and you try to inject the one you had otherwise, then expectation of earnings **&lt;e&gt; = p(B+h) + c(1-p)**

  But the threshhold for trying is also lowered. 
* Should figure out increase of earnings to miners? Really that depends, if we can figure out how to get that single contract, the analysis would be moot.

"Thanks for your insightful comments, Vitalik. I look forward to discussing the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Health Insurance at an upcoming Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup. I'll use the opportunity to address the points you brought up and seek out others' feedback as well; in the meantime I wanted to share a few thoughts that come immediately to mind. 

1. Interface: Excellent point. In general, I believe that society's familiarity with centralization (and lack of familiarity with sharing economies) will mean time &amp; energy expended creating a culture shift. Will we see the emergence of AirBnB-like website to facilitate the formation of these autonomous groups? Can these types of matchmaking websites simplify pairing between individuals and healthcare providers to the point that the lay person can subscribe to DAHI with minimal effort?

2. Social/Incentives
In addition to aligning incentives (always tricky in healthcare), there’s also the issue of the composition of the group of (autonomously) insured people. How can we ensure consistency in how healthy/unhealthy each group is, so that we don’t end up with groups of all-healthy people and groups of ultra-unhealthy people? Could this be facilitated by a matchmaking-like website as described in (1)? Or by inherent rules built into the contract to prevent discrimination based on medical conditions? Or rules that group people based on geographic location?

3. Legal: Another excellent point you bring up. I’m excited about the potential to both do great social good, as well as collect initial data, in the developing world. DAHI makes a lot of sense here. I also think there could be opportunities to experiment in the US. I agree that trying to completely substitute health insurance with blockchain would be difficult up front, but physicians, particularly those in private practice, are free to choose how they’re reimbursed. There are even groups of physicians and solo practitioners whose practice consists mostly of private payers, and they could theoretically be good early adopters of DAHI if they are willing to accept Ether/cryptocurrency as reimbursement (at least for a portion of their services).

Thanks for the great feedback. I look forward to discussing further.

In my original post I said the protocol should cap the amount of wei per block, but thinking a little more about the problem, it might be better to cap the number of turing clicks per block. Users could then submit their contracts with a payment-per-click figure, and miners would select contracts to process based on the highest return-on-click. By keeping state across blocks, there would not be any problem of figuring out which contracts to choose because each chosen contract will get executed to completion or run out of wei.

I respect the rights of the devs to get paid. They should be compensated. But there are a lot of devs and teams in the open source world making good shit and they aren't getting paid to do so. The rewards they get are fame and then sometimes they turn that into money.

You can look at someone like Vitalik (I don't mean to ignore the other devs, he is just the most prominent) and know that even if he wasn't getting paid he'd be working on this. Hell, if you guys do the fundraiser and literally got $0, would Vitalik stop working on it? Yeah right. Even if he did, the cat is out of the bag, someone else will run with it, there is no going back.

Now if your team has investors and is bloated and needs to make some money, that's something else different, but the project doesn't *need* money going forward.

When this project was first announced, I immediately wanted to put money in on the fundraiser.

"I think I understand what you mean. I believe the complete opposite, I think Ethereum is going to reduce scams if not eliminate them altogether. 

First, it's currently impossible to obfuscate contract code, so all contracts will be in clear text. Anyone pretending to create a contract and not delivering on its promise (frontend/backend schism) would be immediately flagged a scam both by the users of the said site AND on chain. Just like if amazon kept 33% of the credit card numbers to buy themselves fancy paintings, I think we'd know. Ethereum is about to add decentralized, Sybil attack proof reputation systems on top of all that. 

Second, in order to be trustless and decentralized most if not all contracts of an 'escrow' nature would have to have 100% if not more collaterals attached to them, on both sides. Hard to scam if users automatically get their money back.

Third unlike the financial derivates in today's financial world, derivatives in Ethereum would be backed by Ether, or even Bitcoin, and not debt. Good as gold.

Fourth Ethereum makes the building of such services so trivial than consumers will never have been in such a powerful position to 'vote with their feet'. Worrying that someone could scam others with Ethereum is the same as worrying that someone could ask for a cc number on a website today, then disappear the day after. Ethereum will create an ecosystem where anyone acting without proper escrows, total transparency and 100% honesty will be out of business in no time.

"I agree that the readability will probably become a key feature. Every single line of my code is commented because if it wasn't I would never have been able to remember what i was doing halfway through!

That said. The assumption that a more efficient contract will be a more honest one is not completely valid. I discovered while doing this that the best way to increase efficiency in these contracts is to order the logical statements in order of nested constraints (so you don't need to check something multiple times) and then in terms of most likely to occur. 

Admittedly these are just minor improvements for this contract because I'm still learning but one example is that a tie game is far more likely then a winner in tictactoe. so at one point I checked if it was a tie game first in order to avoid having to check if player 1 won or player 2 won since those are far less likely.

Relating this back to the discussion. All ""Admin"" powers are located at the end of the contract because they will almost never be used . as such they also won't affect the efficiency of the rest of the program but i could have easily written an admin power that lets me change the game board of a particular game.

Of course there should be ways to detect this... maybe? The problem as I see it. Ethereum has validated what was supposed to happen. as far as the network is concerned this is how things should be. so without reading the code and checking for a backdoor... i'm not sure how you could do it. This program is only 250 lines long But you could easily envision a much longer contract that has a tiny clause around line 892 which allows you to do all kinds of bad things.

for example:

(when (= (txsender) &lt;Your address here&gt;) (suicide (txsender))

That one line would make it possible for you to define a special account which would steal all funds in the contract and destroy the contract.
That could be pretty hard to catch even in the most readable programs...

(Note my tictactoe game has suicide capabilities given to the admin simply because when i was testing this i didn't want to leave a bunch of contracts around with usable funds in them!

"&gt; Dr Gavin Wood spent the majority of his talk on Friday arguing against centralisation. He argued for a need for ethereum as a trust-less system.
&gt; What concerns me is that giving an estimated $20 million dollars to the ethereum foundation to help ""fund development"" will actually just centralize development around the ideas the ethereum foundation wants exploring, not what the community wants, another problem with this approach is that we have to put an extremely large amount of trust in the ethereum foundation not to simply run away with everybody's bitcoins.

The Ethereum team wants nothing more than to find a trajectory that aligns both the community-at-large and the core team members with the same economic incentive. If anyone has math/econ models to achieve this, please share them on [our official forums](https://forum.ethereum.org/) so we can arrive at a solution that is win-win for everyone involved :)

&gt; I have not seen any guarantees about how much of the money raised in the IPO will go to fund bounties and what amount will go straight into the founder's pockets.

I'm under the impression that documents related to this will be released before the ether pre-sale. Again, the question is how to align all the incentives just in the right way to ensure different types of projects run in different types of ways. i.e. An academic research group will operate under different constraints than a for-profit venture.

&gt; Most pre mined currencies have been called out as scamcoins in the past, the only difference between them and ethereum is that there is innovation on top of ethereum and it has been claimed the pre mine is for the good of the currency. I have yet to see a successful premine coin.
&gt;This premium is not at all necessary and is harmful. It will reduce the chance of mainstream adoption of ethereum. Throughout the currencies future, there will be criticism that it is just a pyramid scheme, more so than for bitcoin, especially due to the ""early adopter discount"".

First and foremost, Ethereum is producing actual technology. You can download proof-of-concept builds that interoperate on a testnet from https://code.ethereum.org, which is regularly updated with builds in both C++ and Go for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can mine (on testnet), send gas/ether to other accounts, even create contracts and execute them. People are so excited about the possibilities that platforms and tools are already working on top of the testnet. If you want more info, #ethereum-dev on Freenode is probably a good place to jump in

&gt; Ethereum represents a potentially great idea. I urge the ethereum foundation to reconsider the premine. You are risking the currencies future for short term financial rewards. Please consider adopting the distribution model of æthereum. You could develop your proof of stake algorithm, slasher, to create a currency which does not have the waste of mining. It is my belief that without your support, æthereum will be forgotten, and without your acceptance of æthereum's ideas, ethereum will fail like every other premium currency. Please make this the future, instead of another get rich quick scheme.

If you were to take a straw poll of the main team (including all support roles, not just devs), I think you'd find that the vast majority are **BY FAR** more concerned about the health of the Ethereum ~~community~~ ecosystem than any amount of cash. The unfortunately reality is that many of us have been working on Ethereum for nearly 6 months without so much as a single satoshi in payment. Some of us have families &amp; mortgages and have had to take loans to pay the bills while we clarify all the complications of launching world-impacting technology with geographically-distributed team members on a shoestring budget.

I hope the community can evaluate us on our actions. Scammers would have ""launched"" &amp; disappeared long ago. Instead, we're building alliances with partners all throughout the world, including 40+ self-organized meetups and dozens of developers contributing to MIT-licensed projects. We're doing our best to make it to conferences to speak, explain, and mix ideas with others all while sleeping on the floor, working 18 hour days, and spending our own savings to make sure the technology marches forward, payday be damned. ;)

Most personnel are eager to receive a significant percentage of ETH as part of their regular compensation.  We will be running a radically open and transparent organization.  For instance, salaries will be formula-based and the formula will be published.

The long-term endowment will be released in tranches that are in time-locked contracts.

If you are holding ETH, it would be in your best interest if the company and its personnel were also holding ETH, and were actively working to increase the value of ETH.  Through this mechanism our interests are further aligned.


&gt; We have to trust you will do the right thing with those funds.

You also have to trust us to do the right thing with the BTC used to purchase ETH in the pre-sale.  Not sure how the pre-mine ETH requires more or different trust.

&gt; under what jurisdiction will the foundation operate under?  

&gt; Will a government who is bothered by Ethereum or any of its contracts/DACs go ahead and close the foundation thus hiting a hard blow?

Ethereum will have hubs in many places around the world.  Two major hubs will be in Switzerland and Canada. If either of those jurisdictions turns against cryptocurrencies, the organization will relocate that hub.

Irrelevant/ &lt;=====&gt; Scary

irrelevant - doesn't fit with current structure, impractical, only select few would use it ('anarchists....'), people can just abandon it, who do you go to for contract dispute about code-- still government/other human third parties etc.

scary - 'irreversibility' of code, taking away 'gray areas' which is domain of human judgment. Fear of bugs in contract.

Bounties for 'issuance'(effectively, but locked in the contract since the start of ethereum) does have a nice property that the more ethers are worth, the more incentive to forfill the bounty, so if the price goes up, bounties get forfilled, putting more ether in circulation.

Having a full programming language means someone could write an infinite loop (doing the same thing over and over forever) and lock everybody's client. So the script has to pay as it goes for the computation it's doing.

"(right.. probably a lot of people dump a lot of ideas near you.. sorry if i am one of the pointless ones.. I should get on the test-blockchain/look at scripts)

One thing i wondered about, isnt proof of stake essentially effortless, the slasher^[link](http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/) algo being there to actual punish the otherwise costless condoning of incorrect or 'loser' blocks.

But since it is effortless, why not have multiple PoS chains. To mine, you wouldnt in principle need to be full client to notice if you see that you are below the score of `checksum(append(X,own_wallet_address))`, where `X=checksum(append(previous_hash_of_block,random_number_of_slasher_of_block))` all you would need is the list of those `X`.

You would need to have to see if the blockchain you won in is actually correct, and you may be punished later by some mechanism like slasher if it isnt. Preferably winner nodes would have time somehow to make themselves full-node regarding that chain or use partial-lightweight clients.(the latter difficult to implement?) I should look at Nxts transparent forging thingy..

And something is needed to transfer coins between blockchains. Could be that you'd just rely on both lightweight clients regarding a lot of them, or you'd need a system of automatic coinswaps, where people tell they client with hot coins to participate..

"The premise that there will be a significant and dominating economic construct called ""wages"" or like wages in the cryptocurrency-based economy is not a given.  This new economy will likely be very fluid in its organization and in the opportunities it presents.  Groups will spontaneously organize around an idea, execute it and possibly move on when something better comes along.  There will be some stability and some inertia for important and well-executed services.  But the barrier to entry to create a start-up and offer an innovative service will be very low.  And attracting funding for a good idea will be fast and easy compared to today's funding models.  Employment will likely often take the form of partial ownership and dividends and partial compensation in other forms (maybe salary, maybe profit sharing, maybe bounties for projects executed).  Distributed Autonomous Organizations with broad ownership will likely come to dominate when the ecosystem has gained a degree of maturity.

Here is a somewhat relevant paragraph from something I am working on at the moment:

""Ethereum (or something like it) is necessary and inevitable.  It will enable distributed replacements for centralized services.  Hierarchically organized central control of systems and organizations was an optimal paradigm when communication and information sharing was difficult, slow and expensive.  In the context of current information processing and communications systems, rapid, widely distributed consensus becomes a viable organizing principle.  And given the ease and propensity for corruption, damage, subversion or co-opting of centralized control structures by corporate leaders, governments, shadow-government agencies, and criminal organizations, a mechanism for distributed control and governance of organizations will surely be well received.""

So while hierarchy and wage slavery made sense in the old slow, stagnant paradigm, the new fluid, dynamic paradigm will likely see regular and rapid reconfiguration of business and other organizations and compensation structures will reflect that agility. 

That's the big picture, long-term ""profound"" answer -- or at least one possible answer.

There are so many other answers.  Basically the economy will configure itself so that it works, if there are enough participants who find the economy a valuable place to spend their time, effort and money.  

Ethereum will enable the easy of creation of cryptocurrencies and distributed exchanges will facilitate rapid conversions into whatever currency is most appropriate for a given use.  A cryptocurrency that tracks Swiss Francs can be used to pay a wage-earner based in Geneva, while her colleague in Peru can be paid in a cryptocurrency that tracks the Nuevo Sol.  For as long as these are the currencies in which the bulk of living expenses are paid, compensation can be negotiated in them.

"You *should* link to the [issuance model](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper#wiki-currency-and-issuance). X ether is bought, total of 0.5X goes to others. 0.225X would be time-locked, probably with a script, so verfiably so. 

0.4X is mined per year, the premine is very acceptable. 

I think the developpers ether share is a little high. They could vary the issuance to themselves as dependent of the ammount of BTC-bought. Idea being that the larger the community, the smaller the fraction of that community is developpers, so their share should be smaller. Also, the ammount of ether bought is an indicator for the potential success of ethereum, so the more is bought, the more ethers are kindah worth, and so the smaller the fraction is to provide some level of value. (The expectation of value of the premine should aways increase with buy-in)

If they want more ether, developpers could buy ether by donating BTC to some charities or something.(dont burn BTC for this purpose, it's silly)

Forks... Well afaik there is no way around it. This is why we basically need to try keep users of cryptocurrencies somehow focussed on developpers and knowledgable people. The lame-ass clones of course shows that a few of them can be convinced, but the effect looks larger than it is if you look at volumes.

There are also 'friendly forks'. Eventually a bitcoin2 or Ethereum2 would be made, I mean i find it hard to believe that there wont ever be a need for that. I always throught such followups should involve the possibility of burning coins in the older version to get them in the newer one. This could also deter clones because those would not get such a followup. (Unless they're not really clones and are really worthy.)

"Great seeing you at the expo Piotr!

&gt; Well, in Ethereum each account and each contract have their own data storage. There is no centralized data storage, which means custom data can only be stored in this way. This in turn means that there will never be one unique DNS in Ethereum, just a set of DNSs each different for each contract that creates them. Depending on which one you will read from, you may get different results for the same domain.

I'll answer this by analogy:

&gt; In the traditional DNS system, there is no single centralized data storage server, which means that there will never be one unique top-level domain; just a set of top-level domains with one for each country or organization that creates one. Depending on whether you go to bitcoin.com or bitcoin.org, you may get different results from the same domain.

Same argument applies here. A few namecoins will likely become the most popular, and everyone will refer to them.

&gt; Next, the currency needs an issuer, which makes things more complicated.

Actually, you can create issuer-less currencies. All you do is keep a running counter of the last block and allow one transaction per block to automatically assign an additional X units to the block.coinbase. If you want a currency that can track the US dollar or gold or the CPI, then yes, you need either an issuer or a financial derivatives scheme plus price feeds, which we have quite openly admitted is somewhat more complicated.

&gt; Another approach that might work for this could come in a form of Ethereum having awareness of what happens in other currencies. One could create a contract that creates a piece of currency in Ethereum each time a transaction sends money to a given address in say, Bitcoin. This approach would work well if you want to have proof-of-burn currencies, but wouldn't work too well if you would want to redeem the currency back in its original blockchain, unless that system would have some knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain. 

Umm... I think there was an announcement made a few days ago that [pretty much solved](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/12349/side-chains-challenges-potential/) that particular issue.

&gt; Now the question is, what incentive would anyone have to be putting that data into the blockchain?

Two possibilities. (1) as a loss leader for other services (just like the free APIs provided by blockchain.info), (2) the contract would require a one-cent micropayment in order to access it from another contract.

&gt; If we wanted to include data in a trust-less way for say, a transaction happening in Bitcoin, we would need to provide the transaction data, then add the merkle branch and a block header to prove that the transaction is a part of a block, and then perhaps an entire block header chain to show that the blocks are not fake?

Basically, you need to have a contract which acts as a self-contained SPV client for the external blockchain. I describe it somewhat more in detail in the above linked article on side-chains.

&gt; What is the incentive of creating useful contracts in Ethereum? 

Same thing that incentivizes people to write open-source libraries now. That usually means either (1) it's useful enough that your personal benefit from the contract outweights the cost, or (2) as something to show off and draw attention to yourself when seeking out customers or employers. Incentive of development is likely 20x lower, true, but cost of development is also 20x lower.

&gt; If you create the most useful service there is but the only way to communicate with it is through a command line or creating some code, few people will use it. Similarly in Ethereum creating a contract might only be half of the job. The other half would be creating a good user interface for people to be able to use your contract in a meaningful way. I think this aspect is not emphasized enough at this point and may put a lot of people off when they get their first impressions of Ethereum.

It's not emphasized enough at this point because the GUI toolkits do not yet exist. They will soon, and it's been in the plans for a long time to switch emphasis to the interface side at that point.

&gt; I personally think the Ethereum team might benefit from having a more extrovert person that focuses on explaining Ethereum to non-technical people, and bringing in Vitalik to focus on the technical aspects of what they are developing. Using Vitalik for everything isn't all that optimal.

Agreed. I would love to see Charles and Gavin out there more. I'm much better as a coder and cryptoeconomist than to talk to every public audience out there. We need a balance.

&gt; Lets name all the denominations

People only need to remember ether, finney and wei. The others are just there for future-compatibility. The reason why I added different names is because I think it's ridiculous what's going on in Bitcoin now where everything costs 0.0xx BTC, and if it goes up even more it will start costing 0.00xx BTC or x mBTC. Forcing everyone to say ""zero point zero zero"" or ""milli"" every time when that's the de facto default anyway is cruel and unusual punishment.

"It is just like Bitcoin.  The database is stored in its entirety on every node. Updating the database involves running cryptographically signed scripts in an unambiguous order as determined by the proof of work secured Blockchain. The differences are mainly that the ethereum scripts are Turing complete and the ether units are tracked as balances in accounts instead of specific inputs and outputs.

Scalability is of course a concern in Bitcoin as well as ethereum. Bitcoin has been very conservative with the transaction limits imposed in the 1 mb block size.  And yet for all of Bitcoin's popularity, the scalability limits are not really an issue yet.   If Ethereum becomes big, scaling will require some resources, but so far even cheap  consumer tech is really very good.  Think of how much data you can store on a single, cheap 4 tb hard drive.

"""Tree of trust and reputation"" IPO model

Use personal trust and reputation to privilege people who are close connected to the project: Contributors, friends, community members, crypto gurus,... 
They get an invitation from the Ethereum team for the first round of a closed IPO with a special Ether price. Afterwards those people have the right to send invitations to people they think should be privileged for the next closed IPO round. Then another closed round and afterwards starts the public IPO. 

The Ether price will rise from round to round. So people who are close in the trust/reputation line to the Ethereum team get more Ether for their BTC as people who are further away or the general public. That way a whale cannot buy a dominating share (assuming Winklevoss&amp;co are not close friends to the Ether team or the next trust levels), and people who contributed a lot but dont have much money (or dont care so much about money) will get a fair share.

Example with some estimated values:
1. Round: Duration 3 days; 100 people invited; price 100k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 10 BTC per person so they hold 100M Ether and payed 1000 BTC.
2. Round: 4 days; 500 invitations sent from the 1. IPO round group; price 20k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 5 BTC / person so they hold 50M Ether and payed 2500 BTC.
3. Round: 7 days; 2000 friends from the 2. round group; price 5 000 Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 2 BTC / person so they hold 20M Ether and payed 4000 BTC.. 
Open to the public: 1. week: price 2 000 Ether for 1 BTC, then price moves slowly to 1000 ETH/BTC until the end of the IPO (6 weeks).

Even if a whale would spend 100k BTC he just gets 200M Ether in the public IPO. The people from the closed IPO rounds would hold 170M Ether (in the above example). 
All the variables (price, number of invitations, duration,...) need to be designed in a way that they produce a good equilibrium of fairness and incentive (not easy probably).

I think a cap is not needed and if so it could be done the way that it will not immediately stop the IPO but will close it in 3 days or so.

If the IPO generated too much BTC, donate it to some organisations like Wikileaks, EFF,…

"I'm a generalist, so take this for what it's worth.  I'm still learning.

From what I understand, Mastercoin provides additional protocol features on top of the Bitcoin protocol.

Ethereum is on a whole another level, as it appears to allow a form of trusted compute to occur on the nodes.  This includes network features AND compute features. Essentially you can write code and have it run in a trusted and autonomous way.  You could code up something like Mastercoin with Ethereum.

"Kindah interesting if things can have intrinsic value. Well, of course someone could say 'here is a pot of gold, one gold coin for each ethereal gold coin', but that aint exactly trustless!

Trustlessly, ether itself has intrinsic value *in* Ethereum, because it can be used to do transactions, have scripts with storage. [The dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflp7z1) suggests there are other ways to make intrinsic external to ethereum value be identifiable by ethereum, making it trustless.

I dont fully understand that code though, looks to me like every 100 blocks, someone can get ether by proving you have some random bit of the data? But that doesnt prove anyone else than the prover actually has access to it, and afaict people can actually compete for it.

I have different concept for the idea, the viewer puts some coin at stake in a script:

    //NOTE: currently PSUEDOCODE(still looking into the script itself..), even so CONTAINS HOLES
    
    command=tx.data[0] //What is being asked of the script.
    view_signature= tx.data[1]
    view_checksum = tx.data[2] //What data is being requested.
    view_timelimit= tx.data[3] //Limit before which things must happen.
    
    //constants: GRUDGE,REDEEM, grudge_cost,stake_holder_pubkey, 
    // redeem_difficulty, redeem_profit, VIEW_REQUEST
    
    //Server didnt get his shot at payment, because the viewer didnt send proof that
    // it was served. Server can punish by destroying coin on _both_ sides.
    //view_signature is now the signature of the request.
    if command = GRUDGE &amp;&amp; tx.value &gt;= grudge_cost &amp;&amp; block_number &lt; view_timelimit &amp;&amp;
       signature_belongs_to(stake_holder_pubkey, view_signature,
                            append(VIEW_REQUEST, view_checksum,view_timelimit)) :
       destroy_coins(2*tx.value)
       stop
    
    //Server wants to get the coin for serving it. To limit fees and not weigh down
    // the blockchain too much, he only has a probability.
    //view_signature is now the signature of the viewer telling the server he got
    // the gooods.
    if command = REDEEM &amp;&amp; block_number &lt; view_timelimit &amp;&amp; 
       checksum(append(view_checksum,block.parenthash)) &lt; redeem_difficulty &amp;&amp;
       signature_belongs_to(stake_holder_pubkey, view_signature,
                            append(VIEW_ACCEPTED, view_checksum,view_timelimit))
          send(tx.sender,redeem_reward)
          stop

     invalid //If you get here the transaction cant even get on the blockchain.

Basically after the server sends files, he gets a shot at getting paid, and if he doesnt, he has recourse, even though it costs both parties. You could tweak the ratio.. 

Note that it needs a starting time aswel, otherwise servers might just accept to serve when they happen to win the lotery.(it needs to be future checksums) A harder to solve problem is that the viewer himself may try to extract everything before miners get to it by making successful requests until he finds payouts. 

Servers would of course look at the script to establish its difficulty and payout, and if it contains enough coin in its balance.

Edit: also note that the server may get multiple attempts at winning the reward, you can calculate the probability and average payout, so no problem there. You could make it so that millions of views pass without payout; without *any* transaction occurring on the blockchain. Of course you want payouts to be small, but big relative to fees, but serving up data is really cheap.

Edit: of suppose you could combine this with the dropbox code to reward holding on to data even if no-one views it. Also note that the medium across which the data is accessed is not even in play in either script. Could be system where anyone can serve it up, where the cheapest methods win, that also depends on location of viewers.

"Response from Dan Larimer: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg28113#msg28113

&gt; There is one theme that keeps coming up in Charles's response:  1 chain to rule them all.  Unless you have many Ethereum clones each running a subset of the contracts it will become bottlenecked by bandwidth and centralized.  Then you need merged mining with all of its challenges.

&gt; BASIC is turing complete, but I wouldn't implement a blockchain in it even though technically I could.  They would have to provide a complete set of APIs, data structures, etc to build anything remotely complex.  The ether currency does not pay dividends and in fact is inflationary while it is mined into existence.   Theory and practice are two VERY DIFFERENT things so being turing complete is a necessary but insufficient condition.

&gt; If I was on their project I would eliminate mining and replace it with proof of stake and consensus.  Then all that remains is the viability of their generic contracts.   I will just assume that this is possible and that they will do this because it is an easy change.    Now they are left with the initial allocation problem.   

&gt; With the structure of the code I am writing for BitShares it is very easy to modify it to 'write new contracts' and with the need to worry about mining it is equally easy to launch new chains as it would be to launch a new high-volume contract. 

&gt; You cannot put all transactions from all contracts on a single chain while claiming to be decentralized.  So until they can produce some hard numbers on how many transactions per second they can process, how large their chain will grow, and the processing time required to validate their chain, their claims remain purely theoretical and not based in the reality of limited resources.  I am sure they can produce something that works well in the early days.

&gt; We have designs for a dozen different DACs each of which we estimate will max out the bandwidth an average individual would be willing to use even though we are taking extreme measures to minimize transaction volume.

&gt; Just imagine I implemented BitShares on top of Etherum and was attempting to process 10 trx per second through their scripting engine and manage an order book that requires a database of 10K bids/asks and that the state of this contract cannot be cached in memory because there are 100 other contracts each attempting to process 10 trx per second.  Every node would have to keep loading and unloading contracts from their 'archived state' in the blockchain to their 'in memory' state necessary to execute the transaction or the scripts would have to operate 'on disk'.

&gt; I am sure they can do some innovative stuff, but the one and only reason to have a turing complete scripting language in a blockchain is to gain the so-called security of common mining.  Without mining it is far easier to launch a new DAC from a common code base than to attempt to build a new DAC with one hand tied behind your back by etherums turing complete, but limited, scripting language.   The transaction fees of implementing BTS on Etherum would be very high.

&gt; It will be fun to watch how this all plays out.   I must congratulate Charles on being a great salesman because his arguments are very persuasive to anyone who hasn't been living and breathing block-chain designs and scalability issues for the past year.  I hope they produce something great because if they can then I will be very happy to improve upon it.

"More intrinsic worth?  Who knows.  All we can look at is the size of the monetary base of both, measured in, say USD.

I personally think bitcoin should be the the ""gold"" that backstops global financial systems and ether will be the ""oil"" that fuels the machinery of the emerging economy.

Ethereum has a constant linear issuance model for ether. (http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) 

If you believe that Ethereum will become a substate for emerging global and social systems, then it is reasonable to believe that the growth of that economy will be exponential for a period (assuming the traditional S-curve adoption model).  If this is true, the value of ether will track the exponential demand more closely than the linear supply.  And I think bitcoin will do something similar.

In the present economy the financial industry is almost larger than the rest of the economy. :-)  Or at least it seems that way.  I don't think such a financialization skew will apply to the emerging economy since it is inefficient.  And I believe the emerging economy will crush inefficiencies quickly.  In this scenario, the ""monetary base"" of ether would likely be larger than that of bitcoin.

Besides, chemically the same processes is used by *many* creatures, and i dont believe for a second it couldnt be done better. Evolution clearly has a lack of ability to actually inovate.

"Ethereum has two languages, E-CLL (the language people write in) and ES (the language that contracts execute); I'll answer the question for both separately.

E-CLL is a proof of concept. Right now, it's basically a subset of Python, with the exception that integers are modulo 256. Ultimately, I hope that it gets expanded to cover all of pure Python, and other languages are written that

ES has a few specific requirements:

(i) High level of deduplication. We are in a unique situation where thousands of people's code is stored in a common database where we can choose the format, and we should take advantage of that. Ultimately, I want to erase the distinction between functions, code-blocks and libraries.
(ii) Simplicity. The fewer ops the better.
(iii) Optimization-friendliness.

The question is, what is the right tool for the job?

There are 4 main solutions to the problem:

1. Assembly-like language with jumps
2. Postscript-like language with concatenation and functions
3. Lisp-like language with functions and recursion
4. Some moderately simple language that actual humans code in, like Lua

Ethereum 0.0.1, as old-timers might recall, was purely (1). Then, on the advice of Andrew Miller, Paul Snow and others, I switched to stack-based, but still with jumps. Now, we are looking at something similar to (2). You might notice that ES2 is actually almost exactly like Postscript, except that we are using hashes-as-pointers as a possible alternative to including lists directly and we don't have arrays, dicts, variables or first-class functions. However, Gav Wood's criticism of (2) is that it's imposing a preference for a certain set of control structures (IFELSE, WHILE, function calling) by fiat, whereas a jump-based approach lets the compiler create whatever control structures it wants.

(3) is interesting and highly elegant, primarily because Lisp is designed to be extensible so it might be possible to use an existing Lisp interpreter (although that might also be problematic, since we do heavily rely on 20-32 byte strings and ints and all existing machines are 4-byte or 8-byte). I also like the Lisp approach from a philosophical standpoint, in that it has a very high level of simplicity by reducing everything to functions - an interesting parallel to the assembly approach of reducing everything to jumps. However, my main qualm with Lisp is that Lisp is fundamentally a functional language designed around immutable data structures, and Ethereum is fundamentally a state machine. 

(4) is a bad idea, since humans' coding preferences change. Sure, we can pick a language that people like coding in now. But 10 years down the line, people might invent some completely new paradigm, and we would end up with people writing compilers down to Lua - a much more shaky and untested field than compiling down to register-assembly, or stack, or even Lisp. 

Ultimately, I think the optimal ES design should be decided on based on what the actual applications are that people want to use. We have a person trying to implement a clearinghouse, as well as many other applications, and we'll see how the language can be tweaked to make such applications work better.",0,t1_cf77k0m,t3_1x0ebg,t3_1x0ebg,False,,7,False,Founder,1432254960,1391559453,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cf77k0m,True,0

&gt;You could apply your argument just as well to any IPO in the stock market. IPO investors get a fixed price and sometimes the stock goes down afterwards.

No, this is not at all like investing in a company's IPO. A company's stock is supposed to pay dividends. Ether pays no dividends. Secondly, a company's stock isn't created out of thin air by some mining process; it's issued by the company whenever they want to raise funds. It's like saying the ethereum devs should just create and sell more ether whenever they need more money. Clearly, that's not the value proposition they're going for.

&gt; I'm not going to fully address Dan's concerns here. The questions he listed indicate they either didn't read or didn't comprehend the whitepaper. For example, the entire philosophy of Ethereum is to be a base layer for innovation thus the particular economic model of a DAC running on top of Ethereum is beyond the scope of our design. A person could indeed have dividends in a sub-currency, yet this point seems to have been missed or ignored.

&gt; As for P2P exchange, we have a close relationship with Open Transactions and combined with a namecoin style contract provided in the whitepaper and bitmessage makes a significantly more efficient distributive exchange than is possible with BitShares. Trust is not required as auditing can be done on Ethereum blockchain and we wouldn't suffer any bloat.  

&gt; Things like 7 again demonstrate either a lack of comprehension or ignorance of our design, contracts are more than robust enough to launch a proof of stake subcurrency. 6 seems to ignore ethereum script is turing complete and thus you can compile a language like c++ into it (anyone ever used coffeescript to write js)?

&gt; On a side note, I am honestly curious how Invictus intends on building DACs without a turing complete language? It seems like you would end in an infinite inductive process of having to build a bigger feature set for the next set of DACs. I guess they have a different philosophy and this is fine.

"Well, just like in regular economics, if it were too expensive people wouldn't use it and so the price would drop as there gets to be a surplus people want to liquidate their ether and not wait weeks to do so. Same for if the price gets very low, people will utilize the extra value. These balances keep the currency at a value determined by the market, and no one will really know what the market entails until the chips fall.

People writing and using contracts want to entice miners to include their transactions in the new blocks. If the miners demand high prices, people will use it less and they would be forced to lower their demand to maximize profit.

A higher price could very much increase adoption. If the price is very expensive, more people will make a profit mining. It seems that normal computers will not be much worse than ""mining"" rigs and so people might just mine for what they need and forego an exchange altogether.

One thing is for sure, people are going to be using it and it won't get to be prohibitively expensive.

"I think I understand what you mean. I believe the complete opposite, I think Ethereum is going to reduce scams if not eliminate them altogether. 

First, it's currently impossible to obfuscate contract code, so all contracts will be in clear text. Anyone pretending to create a contract and not delivering on its promise (frontend/backend schism) would be immediately flagged a scam both by the users of the said site AND on chain. Just like if amazon kept 33% of the credit card numbers to buy themselves fancy paintings, I think we'd know. Ethereum is about to add decentralized, Sybil attack proof reputation systems on top of all that. 

Second, in order to be trustless and decentralized most if not all contracts of an 'escrow' nature would have to have 100% if not more collaterals attached to them, on both sides. Hard to scam if users automatically get their money back.

Third unlike the financial derivates in today's financial world, derivatives in Ethereum would be backed by Ether, or even Bitcoin, and not debt. Good as gold.

Fourth Ethereum makes the building of such services so trivial than consumers will never have been in such a powerful position to 'vote with their feet'. Worrying that someone could scam others with Ethereum is the same as worrying that someone could ask for a cc number on a website today, then disappear the day after. Ethereum will create an ecosystem where anyone acting without proper escrows, total transparency and 100% honesty will be out of business in no time.

"Response from Charles Hoskinson: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.msg4497464#msg4497464

&gt; I'm not going to fully address Dan's concerns here. The questions he listed indicate they either didn't read or didn't comprehend the whitepaper. For example, the entire philosophy of Ethereum is to be a base layer for innovation thus the particular economic model of a DAC running on top of Ethereum is beyond the scope of our design. A person could indeed have dividends in a sub-currency, yet this point seems to have been missed or ignored.

&gt; As for P2P exchange, we have a close relationship with Open Transactions and combined with a namecoin style contract provided in the whitepaper and bitmessage makes a significantly more efficient distributive exchange than is possible with BitShares. Trust is not required as auditing can be done on Ethereum blockchain and we wouldn't suffer any bloat.  

&gt; Things like 7 again demonstrate either a lack of comprehension or ignorance of our design, contracts are more than robust enough to launch a proof of stake subcurrency. 6 seems to ignore ethereum script is turing complete and thus you can compile a language like c++ into it (anyone ever used coffeescript to write js)?

&gt; On a side note, I am honestly curious how Invictus intends on building DACs without a turing complete language? It seems like you would end in an infinite inductive process of having to build a bigger feature set for the next set of DACs. I guess they have a different philosophy and this is fine.

"First of all let me say that I'm elated with the direction that the Ethereum team is taking regarding mining. It's thinking in the right direction.

I am a little bit concerned that making it fool proof may end up making it so complicated that we create edge cases that get exploited once the ledger is live.

I think the major problem with mining algorithms is that they are misnamed.

Mining is not about expending effort or, finding things or even being decentralized (although the last one is a subset of the intent).

“Mining” is about hosting, protecting, processing and appending the ledger of active transactions. It would probably more ideally be called “Maintenance”. Maintenance needs to be set up in such a fashion that those doing the maintaining never have an incentive or alternatively never get an opportunity to mess with the original intent of the blockchain. Decentralization seems to mesh well with this intent.

The design of ASICs that do general purpose computing is bit of a contradiction in terms. If ASICs emerge that maintain the original intent of the ledger, I cannot see how resisting them would be anything but inefficient to the intent of the ledger. They would be an incredible boon to computer science as they would essentially be “blockchain machines”. If a group becomes dominant (which will happen anyway, if we succeed at general purpose, Amazon will become the dominant Ether mining company), they will have to do so because they “maintain” the blockchain better, cheaper, faster than anyone else. Bitcoin’s mining community cannot claim that at the moment because they only protect the ledger against fraud, they don’t guarantee any of its other functions.",0,t1_cg867wg,t3_20zhvz,t3_20zhvz,False,,6,False,,1433003766,1395398829,sjalq,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,6,,cg867wg,True,0

"I agree with pretty much everything you said. You'll want a light interface to do name-&gt;identity info lookup, you can use .onion addresses as identity data, merge mine? sure.

The convoluted part is *not* the fact that we're using a blockchain-based tech to store identities. It all sounds well and good. In fact, for what's available now, OneName is perfect.

It gets convoluted when you want your services to interact with the identity info or enforce rules around that identity. You then have to query the name-chain for the info you need, and insert that data into a transaction on another chain. Enforcing service rules based on identity info means you practically need that info stored in whichever chain you are using. Thats why you have Twister using its own name system, instead of just using OneName/Namecoin.

This isn't necessarily an issue at the moment, since there isn't even much of a coherent ecosystem of decentralized services yet. However, once more services are layered on ethereum, I think it will start to make more sense to transfer identities over there.

Then again, perhaps most of this is sorted out when you add an ethereum address alongside the other information in your OneName. OneName can act as a sort of meta-identity system.

"&gt;there would be nothing stopping the miners themselves from creating blocks that are arbitrarily hard to compute.

Can you elaborate on their incentive to do this?

&gt; Bitcoin has the 1 MB limit; Ethereum needs to have either a mandatory fee or a few mandatory limits of its own.

It seems to me that if computational power is already a scarce resource, then why would further restrictions be needed? Shouldn't the market be able to price computing cycles on its own? 

Another thing I'm worried about is that two contracts could cost the exact same in terms of computation power but could represent completely different value to their respective users. This could show up in cases where one needs an important contract to be verified in as little a time as possible so that user may be willing to pay more for miners to prioritize it. Conversely, someone who can't afford to have their contract verified within minutes should be able to pay *something* and have it processed within a day or two. A fully market-driven fee structure should accommodate this.

This also affects people in developing countries who may not be able to afford the minimum transaction fee because it's too expensive relative to the value of the services backing it. It would make sense if they could pay a much lower fee and just expect it to take longer to process.

"Anyone here able to respond to [this blog post](http://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/ethereum-dagger-pow-is-flawed/) on why Dagger is flawed?

&gt; But one of the “outstanding” new features in Ethereum is the use of a PoW function specially designed to be memory-hard. While this may be true (though a formal proof is missing and the design document is quite incomplete), the authors completely forgets another key property a PoW function must provide: it must be sequential-memory hard. This means that not only the function should require large amounts of RAM, but it must not allow easy parallelization. 

&gt; Dagger seems to provide almost the best possible scenario for parallelization. In Dagger, a certain amount of RAM is filled by pseudo-random data derived from the header and the nonce.

"""Tree of trust and reputation"" IPO model

Use personal trust and reputation to privilege people who are close connected to the project: Contributors, friends, community members, crypto gurus,... 
They get an invitation from the Ethereum team for the first round of a closed IPO with a special Ether price. Afterwards those people have the right to send invitations to people they think should be privileged for the next closed IPO round. Then another closed round and afterwards starts the public IPO. 

The Ether price will rise from round to round. So people who are close in the trust/reputation line to the Ethereum team get more Ether for their BTC as people who are further away or the general public. That way a whale cannot buy a dominating share (assuming Winklevoss&amp;co are not close friends to the Ether team or the next trust levels), and people who contributed a lot but dont have much money (or dont care so much about money) will get a fair share.

Example with some estimated values:
1. Round: Duration 3 days; 100 people invited; price 100k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 10 BTC per person so they hold 100M Ether and payed 1000 BTC.
2. Round: 4 days; 500 invitations sent from the 1. IPO round group; price 20k Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 5 BTC / person so they hold 50M Ether and payed 2500 BTC.
3. Round: 7 days; 2000 friends from the 2. round group; price 5 000 Ether for 1 BTC. Maybe they invest 2 BTC / person so they hold 20M Ether and payed 4000 BTC.. 
Open to the public: 1. week: price 2 000 Ether for 1 BTC, then price moves slowly to 1000 ETH/BTC until the end of the IPO (6 weeks).

Even if a whale would spend 100k BTC he just gets 200M Ether in the public IPO. The people from the closed IPO rounds would hold 170M Ether (in the above example). 
All the variables (price, number of invitations, duration,...) need to be designed in a way that they produce a good equilibrium of fairness and incentive (not easy probably).

I think a cap is not needed and if so it could be done the way that it will not immediately stop the IPO but will close it in 3 days or so.

If the IPO generated too much BTC, donate it to some organisations like Wikileaks, EFF,… 
or hold it in some extra fund reserved for special stuff with voting rights from a kind of ""Ethereum nobel price commitee"" ...
or fund an ""Ether price for making the world a better place"" ....
or return a part of the BTCs to the investors...",0,t1_cf377l8,t3_1wksgq,t3_1wksgq,1391131812,,0,False,,1432183650,1391130436,nucleo_io,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,0,,cf377l8,True,0

"A coordination language is really about building large systems, like the Daemon in Daemon/Freedom. In such systems you might use Ethereum to deal with finances and resources for example, but have other components that deal with other stuff. The different components can be people, servers, algorithms, various software etc. so then a coordination language is used to make all these components composable, so they can all form one integrated system.

For example if one process is a person scanning a specific type of document, then a component could be made that looks for new documents in a folder and the person scanning the documents knows to save all scanned documents in that folder. That component now really encapsulates the scanning software and the person scanning the document, if you were to switch the scanner, the scanning software and the person with, say, a fully automatic scanner, the component would still look and behave in exactly the same way to all the other components in the system. The thing is really about wrapping all the jobs, software, web servers etc in this kind of components, then describe the flow of data, money, resources and things through a network of such components.

Since such components are not necessarily pure software, you can use types that refer to physical objects. For example a component for a 3d printer, can have one input and one output. The input has a CAD model as the type, while the output might have ""ABS plastic thing"" as the type. If the 3d printer was switched to another printer of even injection molding, as long as it takes the same input, the CAD model, and outputs an ABS plastic object, it wouldn't matter for the rest of the system. The output of the 3d printer component might be connected to a robot arm component, that would expect to find an ABS plastic thing at a specific position, but the robot arm does not care how that ABS plastic thing ended up in that specific position, just programming function doesn't care how an integer which is going to be its input, came to existence.

&gt;The **tragedy of the commons** is an [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic) theory by [Garrett Hardin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin), according to which the depletion of a shared [resource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource) by individuals, acting independently and rationally according to each one's self-interest, act contrary to the group's long-term best interests by depleting the common resource. The concept is often cited in connection with [sustainable development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development), meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the debate over [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming). ""Commons"" can include the atmosphere, [oceans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch), rivers, [fish stocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_stocks), [national parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park), [advertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising), and even [parking meters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_meter). The tragedy of the commons has particular relevance in analyzing behavior in the fields of [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), [evolutionary psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology), [anthropology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), [game theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), [politics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics), [taxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation), and [sociology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology). Some also see the ""tragedy"" as an example of [emergent behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_behavior), the outcome of individual interactions in a [complex system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system).

"I agree with pretty much everything you said. You'll want a light interface to do name-&gt;identity info lookup, you can use .onion addresses as identity data, merge mine? sure.

The convoluted part is *not* the fact that we're using a blockchain-based tech to store identities. It all sounds well and good. In fact, for what's available now, OneName is perfect.

It gets convoluted when you want your services to interact with the identity info or enforce rules around that identity. You then have to query the name-chain for the info you need, and insert that data into a transaction on another chain. Enforcing service rules based on identity info means you practically need that info stored in whichever chain you are using. Thats why you have Twister using its own name system, instead of just using OneName/Namecoin.

This isn't necessarily an issue at the moment, since there isn't even much of a coherent ecosystem of decentralized services yet. However, once more services are layered on ethereum, I think it will start to make more sense to transfer identities over there.

Then again, perhaps most of this is sorted out when you add an ethereum address alongside the other information in your OneName. OneName can act as a sort of meta-identity system.

"As Vitalik indicated, we have no idea where the 29.4% number came from.  Any speculations at this point are unfounded.  We are still working out budgets and other financial issues and have not finalized any numbers. 

We are acutely aware of the community sentiment regarding a possible pre-mine.  We are also weighing the value of having ETH to pay salaries which keeps our individual and corporate interests more completely aligned with those of Genesis Sale ETH buyers.  Whether there is a pre-mine or not, we will need to have lots of ETH on day one to pay out obligations (e.g. salaries to developers), to help fund third parties who are developing DApps on Ethereum, and possibly to help stabilize the currency in the early days.  We are looking at ways to reduce the pre-mine significantly and possibly even eliminate it.  If we do end up eliminating it or having a very small pre-mine, we will have to buy ETH in the market which creates other issues.

We certainly don't want the role of a central bank, but in the early days of bootstrapping the system, it may be prudent to ensure that the currency is stable while new businesses on the system are making their services available and figuring out the implementational details of their business models.  Some third parties have already indicated that they are interested in setting up trade desks to stabilize any currency fluctuations (and be paid for taking risks in these activities).  Such groups will likely assist ETH to remain in a non-volatile trading band and they will likely have other businesses that depend on an ETH price that is not excessively volatile.  In the event that there is not enough ETH liquidity at certain times and exchange rates rise rapidly, we may want to have a pool of readily available ETH that we can draw from to reduce drastic upward volatility and enable businesses on the system to operate economically while the economy grows and gains stability. Bootstrapping an economy will be an interesting endeavor.  We expect businesses on the system to figure things out, bottom up, grass roots.  But one thing they don't need to contend with is an excessively volatile ETH price, so we may step in on occasion to dampen large swings.  This is all still under discussion and rest assured that we will default to fully free market dynamics as soon as possible.

"You *should* link to the [issuance model](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper#wiki-currency-and-issuance). X ether is bought, total of 0.5X goes to others. 0.225X would be time-locked, probably with a script, so verfiably so. 

0.4X is mined per year, the premine is very acceptable. 

I think the developpers ether share is a little high. They could vary the issuance to themselves as dependent of the ammount of BTC-bought. Idea being that the larger the community, the smaller the fraction of that community is developpers, so their share should be smaller. Also, the ammount of ether bought is an indicator for the potential success of ethereum, so the more is bought, the more ethers are kindah worth, and so the smaller the fraction is to provide some level of value. (The expectation of value of the premine should aways increase with buy-in)

If they want more ether, developpers could buy ether by donating BTC to some charities or something.(dont burn BTC for this purpose, it's silly)

Forks... Well afaik there is no way around it. This is why we basically need to try keep users of cryptocurrencies somehow focussed on developpers and knowledgable people.

"While CLL might be (a bit) easier to learn, LLL has the advantage that the compiler is build right into the AlethZero client. Ofcourse the toolkit availability can change on a weekly basis :)

At this point I would suggest studying both CLL and LLL. To understand their syntax you only need a beginners understanding of Python/Ruby/Whatever (for CLL) or Lisp (for LLL). All the Ethereum API internals are exactly the same if you understand the different coding style of CLL and LLL.

Also take a look at http://k1n0k0.github.io/ethereum-simulator/ and https://github.com/jorisbontje/cll-sim to get an idea what is possible.

"Good point. Some contracts may have mechanisms in which payment enters the company that are inherently only via the contract though. A namecoin contract could be used not to only assign a name and public key. They could also provide a payment address. And the namecoin account would be controlled by the company contract. So then you cant just tell the web developer to change the code to avoid the company contract, that hypothetical future browser already decided by the namecoin DNS.

I suppose you could still try loophole the system, by contacting costumers directly, offer a discount or something to use another adress.

"From my perspective, any new technical solution seeking to assist in developing countries needs to address actual (not perceived) problems with accessible solutions. While technical solutions to problems may assist in addressing those problems, they need to be humble enough to understand why and how to market themselves. For example, it is often cited that Africa has leapfrogged legacy infrastructure requirements in land based telecommunications. This is, more or less true, but it is likely a factor of corporate incentives to provide services to predominantly oral societies that has driven this rather than any particular love of a Nokia 6100. It also has some disadvantages because reliable broadband into homes, even in a town like Nairobi, still requires land based infrastructure and providing any level of comprehensive solutions, like APIs for mobile money systems, is exceedingly complicated because the IP is owned by corporations who have no interest in adopting standards. 

How does this apply to the Ethereum project? From my perspective, Ethereum projects which seek to provide solutions in developing countries will need to address a number of factors. First, while there may not be as much legacy legal infrastructure, as with legacy landlines, these legacy systems can have advantages. That said they can be easily corrupted. Ethereum can only address one of the two challenges which legal system users in the real world face. Ethereum will allow users to avoid debates upon interpretation of agreements (these mean that). However, the other major reason legal disputes in the transactional space occur is because there is a dispute over whether a particular event in the real world occurred or not. Ethereum, as a block chain technology, cannot address these. It can provide a framework to begin working towards a contracting methodology of trust reduced proof of real world events, but that is about the best it can achieve in the medium term. 

My point is that technological solutions, even the most elegant ones, do come at a cost and are never perfect. 

What Ethereum could provide users with, though, is certainty with respect to how transactions will operate and how disputes over whether a real world event occurred will be resolved. This is a game changer, but it applies to developing countries no more nor less than anywhere else. Many developing countries may have less developed formal rule of law systems, but they still have rule frameworks in which commercial transactions operate which can be just as sophisticated as legal rules passed by a parliament. So, in my opinion, the competition with other rule frameworks is not *necessarily* lower but it is slightly different. 

Second, people often assume that citizens of developing countries are somehow more willing to embrace change to existing ways and means, but as development economists have more or less shown, the opposite is actually true. People closer to the poverty line have a stronger resistance to change than those in the middle class. To succeed in developing countries, Ethereum projects will likely need to abstract away the brilliant technology behind what is happening and just provide things that work. 

Lastly, any Ethereum project looking to succeed needs to market themselves well. Simply building great stuff is not enough. But marketing well requires time, knowledge, and presence. So time will tell what happens. 

For my part, I remain very optimistic about the possibilities Ethereum will provide, but for me those possibilities remain more in the area of automating complex tasks than in replacing rule frameworks... at least in the short and medium term.",0,t1_ch6ql48,t3_24b3aa,t3_24b3aa,False,,2,False,,1433602166,1398933712,compleatang,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,2,,ch6ql48,True,0

Since I sit on every discussions regarding the business model we're currently finalizing, I'd love to understand how you came to this invalid conclusion. (checking for hidden microphones... no hidden microphones found :))

Now that we have cleared that up, let's look as to why we are making sure to take our time to get this right. We're building a template for what you could call vc or crowdfunding 2.0. We're aiming for full transparency. Open equity, open salaries, open software, open organization, this is going to be open source wall-to-wall.

"That would imply an authentication. Otherwise how to see if somebody is US citizen or not? 
If they use authentication the ""whale"" problem would be solved as well. 
I dont like authentication much, but otherwise, nearly everybody accept authentication for trading BTC via exchanges as well, there is nearly no exchange out there without KYC style authentication.

It would create an inverse situation to BTC: 

In BTC early adopters got a lot of BTC with mining anonymously, today it is very hard to get BTC anonymously, most people buy them at an exchange and are tracked (company -&gt; state) that way.

With Ether all the investors would get tracked when there is an authentication scheme. But then miners and Ether buyers who use p2p exchanges would get their Ethers anonymously, assuming that with Ethereum we will get decentralized p2p exchanges. Also we can assume that there will be soon anonymizer tools, so even the fund raisers could ""wash"" their money by selling it to themself as anonymized buyer.

So at a result, I do not see much of a problem with authentication from a privacy perspective.
The government (switzerland if the org will be registered there) would have access to the list of fundraisers and their investments. But a fundraiser could sell his investment as soon Ethereum goes live and the tools for obtaining anonymity are in place. Nobody knows later on who is the owner of his investment.

Any other critical points about authentication?

&gt;&gt;    Now the question is, what incentive would anyone have to be 
&gt;&gt; putting that data into the blockchain?

&gt;Two possibilities. (1) as a loss leader for other services (just like the &gt;free APIs provided by blockchain.info), (2) the contract would require a &gt;one-cent micropayment in order to access it from another contract.

This doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  I think that it is somewhat naive to think that companies (like, for example, Bloomberg) are going to give away its crown jewels as ""loss leaders"".   

Also, if every byte of data in a data feed has to reside on the block chain, how will you ever be able to manage its growth?  Some of these data feeds sends many megabytes/second of data.  Are you really saying that every single byte has to reside on the ethereum blockchain forever? Especially since much of this data is time sensitive and expires rapidly?  Does this mean that the block chain will be clogged with useless data?

"&gt; Dr Gavin Wood spent the majority of his talk on Friday arguing against centralisation. He argued for a need for ethereum as a trust-less system.
&gt; What concerns me is that giving an estimated $20 million dollars to the ethereum foundation to help ""fund development"" will actually just centralize development around the ideas the ethereum foundation wants exploring, not what the community wants, another problem with this approach is that we have to put an extremely large amount of trust in the ethereum foundation not to simply run away with everybody's bitcoins.

The Ethereum team wants nothing more than to find a trajectory that aligns both the community-at-large and the core team members with the same economic incentive. If anyone has math/econ models to achieve this, please share them on [our official forums](https://forum.ethereum.org/) so we can arrive at a solution that is win-win for everyone involved :)

&gt; I have not seen any guarantees about how much of the money raised in the IPO will go to fund bounties and what amount will go straight into the founder's pockets.

I'm under the impression that documents related to this will be released before the ether pre-sale. Again, the question is how to align all the incentives just in the right way to ensure different types of projects run in different types of ways. i.e. An academic research group will operate under different constraints than a for-profit venture.

&gt; Most pre mined currencies have been called out as scamcoins in the past, the only difference between them and ethereum is that there is innovation on top of ethereum and it has been claimed the pre mine is for the good of the currency. I have yet to see a successful premine coin.
&gt;This premium is not at all necessary and is harmful. It will reduce the chance of mainstream adoption of ethereum. Throughout the currencies future, there will be criticism that it is just a pyramid scheme, more so than for bitcoin, especially due to the ""early adopter discount"".

First and foremost, Ethereum is producing actual technology. You can download proof-of-concept builds that interoperate on a testnet from https://code.ethereum.org, which is regularly updated with builds in both C++ and Go for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can mine (on testnet), send gas/ether to other accounts, even create contracts and execute them. People are so excited about the possibilities that platforms and tools are already working on top of the testnet. If you want more info, #ethereum-dev on Freenode is probably a good place to jump in

&gt; Ethereum represents a potentially great idea. I urge the ethereum foundation to reconsider the premine. You are risking the currencies future for short term financial rewards. Please consider adopting the distribution model of æthereum. You could develop your proof of stake algorithm, slasher, to create a currency which does not have the waste of mining. It is my belief that without your support, æthereum will be forgotten, and without your acceptance of æthereum's ideas, ethereum will fail like every other premium currency. Please make this the future, instead of another get rich quick scheme.

If you were to take a straw poll of the main team (including all support roles, not just devs), I think you'd find that the vast majority are **BY FAR** more concerned about the health of the Ethereum ~~community~~ ecosystem than any amount of cash. The unfortunately reality is that many of us have been working on Ethereum for nearly 6 months without so much as a single satoshi in payment. Some of us have families &amp; mortgages and have had to take loans to pay the bills while we clarify all the complications of launching world-impacting technology with geographically-distributed team members on a shoestring budget.

I hope the community can evaluate us on our actions. Scammers would have ""launched"" &amp; disappeared long ago. Instead, we're building alliances with partners all throughout the world, including 40+ self-organized meetups and dozens of developers contributing to MIT-licensed projects. We're doing our best to make it to conferences to speak, explain, and mix ideas with others all while sleeping on the floor, working 18 hour days, and spending our own savings to make sure the technology marches forward, payday be damned. ;)

"&gt;there would be nothing stopping the miners themselves from creating blocks that are arbitrarily hard to compute.

Can you elaborate on their incentive to do this?

&gt; Bitcoin has the 1 MB limit; Ethereum needs to have either a mandatory fee or a few mandatory limits of its own.

It seems to me that if computational power is already a scarce resource, then why would further restrictions be needed? Shouldn't the market be able to price computing cycles on its own? 

Another thing I'm worried about is that two contracts could cost the exact same in terms of computation power but could represent completely different value to their respective users. This could show up in cases where one needs an important contract to be verified in as little a time as possible so that user may be willing to pay more for miners to prioritize it. Conversely, someone who can't afford to have their contract verified within minutes should be able to pay *something* and have it processed within a day or two. A fully market-driven fee structure should accommodate this.

This also affects people in developing countries who may not be able to afford the minimum transaction fee because it's too expensive relative to the value of the services backing it. It would make sense if they could pay a much lower fee and just expect it to take longer to process.

I cant answer your question, but the above implies ubfuscating privkeys into ethereum itself, not scripts would do the same.

Also, that is a *strong* statement. I.e. if you could for instance have 'magic infinite funds' for something like the [dropbox example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ylvcp/the_ethereum_scam/cflsmuz), basically having that file could be used for mining!

Still, many scripts could be subsidizable with inflation, and not be fraudable.(i dont quite know)

Anyway, a little inflation may be a good thing, but it does beg the question who should get the coin. Regular mining is wasteful, so these are interesting, and that it can be done with script is aswel. Perhaps sub-currencies of ethereum could do it internally.

That said, i dont quite know how to give such a sub-currency value, ethereum itself could presumably only do it, but we currently only have relatively limited practical knowledge of scripts. Voting on scripts that would subsequently get some limited-to-the-desired-inflation 'magical funds' is an idea, but voting might presumably done by weight of coins, so there is a danger to overcentralization of coin through it..

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain). So note that nTransactions and nBlocks is going to be at least linear in time (just like Bitcoin) but the contract memory requirements (the most radical change in scalability characteristics from Bitcoin) is proportional to the number of contracts but does not necessarily continually grow over time. (If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

&gt;

&gt;**Cubieboard** is a single-board computer, made in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. The first short run of prototype boards were sold internationally in September 2012, and the production version as started to be sold in October 2012. It can run Android 4 ICS, Ubuntu 12.04 desktop, Fedora 19 ARM Remix desktop, XBMC media player system, Archlinux ARM  or basic Debian server via Cubian distribution.

&gt;It uses the AllWinner A10 SoC, popular on cheap tablets, phones and media PCs. This SoC is used by developers of the lima driver, an open source driver for the ARM Mali GPU. It was able, at the 2013 FOSDEM demo to run ioquake 3 at 47 fps in 1024×600.

&gt;The Cubieboard team managed to run an Apache Hadoop computer cluster using the Lubuntu GNU/Linux distribution.

"My responses:

1. Yes, contracts might have vulnerabilities. But, following Ethereum's general design philosophy, we're not going to introduce paternalism as part of the base protocol. What people can do, though, is create compilers that automatically add such failsafe checks.
2. There are two ways to solve the randomness problem. First, use a block hash as the seed. Second, have a multistep protocol. Step 1: A generates random x and submits H(x). Step 2: B generates random y and submits H(y). Step 3: A submits x. Step 4: B submits y. Step 5: If exactly one of x or y does not match the hash, the incorrect submitter loses. Otherwise, A wins iff x+y mod 2 = 0, else B wins.

Ethereum uses [purely functional 16-ary Patricia trees](http://wiki.ethereum.org/index.php/Patricia_Tree) internally.

"Never realized that you could! At least for the burning of subcurrencies/ether. Not entirely sure if the economics of burning is sensible, afaik burn-over only makes sense if the intention is really to transfer activity. The transfer seems to be the wrong way :)

But you call it BtcEth, but how do you subsequently relate it to bitcoins?

One scenario: (edited for clarity) Both sides need clients on both bitcoin and ethereum.

* You(Y) want BTC from ether you buy BtcEths from the contract.(or rather, its just ethers that are locked up to ensure presence)
* Some person P wants ethers for BTC and requests a trade. (could be later or before)
* Software on Y's client notices this and gives indication that it is online.
* P chooses from online clients that want BTC, and sets up a bitcoin transaction dependent on H(S), and revealing H(S)
* Y(and possible) sets up ether released upon knowing S.(based on H(S)
* P releases the ether transactions towards him, revealing S. Then Y(and others) use S to release the transactions paying them BTC.

Really, though, it is all about communication here. P is really just looking for offerings, concensus is only needed for the 'upon-release' transactions.

Edit: Not sure, perhaps it *really* helps; i mean the BtcEths contract can provide a stick that people dont lie about wanting BTC. Still, i think maybe communication between clients knowing adresses like that needs to be made somewhat easy too?

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Asymptote***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote) : 

---

&gt;

&gt;In analytic geometry, an **asymptote** (/ˈæsɪmptoʊt/) of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors. In some contexts, such as algebraic geometry, an asymptote is defined as a line which is tangent to a curve at infinity.

&gt;The word asymptote is derived from the Greek ἀσύμπτωτος (asumptotos) which means ""not falling together,"" from ἀ priv. + σύν ""together"" + πτωτ-ός ""fallen."" The term was introduced by Apollonius of Perga in his work on conic sections, but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.

&gt;There are potentially three kinds of asymptotes: horizontal, vertical and oblique asymptotes. For curves given by the graph of a function y = ƒ(x), horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function appro ...

Since I sit on every discussions regarding the business model we're currently finalizing, I'd love to understand how you came to this invalid conclusion. (checking for hidden microphones... no hidden microphones found :))

Now that we have cleared that up, let's look as to why we are making sure to take our time to get this right. We're building a template for what you could call vc or crowdfunding 2.0. We're aiming for full transparency. Open equity, open salaries, open software, open organization, this is going to be open source wall-to-wall.

"That would imply an authentication. Otherwise how to see if somebody is US citizen or not? 
If they use authentication the ""whale"" problem would be solved as well. 
I dont like authentication much, but otherwise, nearly everybody accept authentication for trading BTC via exchanges as well, there is nearly no exchange out there without KYC style authentication.

It would create an inverse situation to BTC: 

In BTC early adopters got a lot of BTC with mining anonymously, today it is very hard to get BTC anonymously, most people buy them at an exchange and are tracked (company -&gt; state) that way.

With Ether all the investors would get tracked when there is an authentication scheme. But then miners and Ether buyers who use p2p exchanges would get their Ethers anonymously, assuming that with Ethereum we will get decentralized p2p exchanges. Also we can assume that there will be soon anonymizer tools, so even the fund raisers could ""wash"" their money by selling it to themself as anonymized buyer.

So at a result, I do not see much of a problem with authentication from a privacy perspective.
The government (switzerland if the org will be registered there) would have access to the list of fundraisers and their investments. But a fundraiser could sell his investment as soon Ethereum goes live and the tools for obtaining anonymity are in place. Nobody knows later on who is the owner of his investment.

Any other critical points about authentication?

"&gt;A signed transaction is an encrypted message, not our private key. What you're talking about using the same private key on a completely different network.

I think that's what the idea actually means. You encrypt a message to proof the ownership of the address. You don't actually give up your private key but rather 'signs' a message using your private key.

Actually ECDSA is pretty flexible in terms of message you can put inside. You can actually use it for something other than transaction. For example you can prove the ownership of an address by signing a message 'Sound_Paper owns this address"" and give the cipher text to other people and they can use your public key to verify that the message originates actually originates from the owner of the address(that's actually what Sign Message function does in Bitcoin Core)

&gt;If I give you a message, and tell you to encrypt it, and then observe other encrypted packets I can deduce the key even on a secure cipher stream.

Well ECDSA is safe from known-ciphertext attack (the attack you just described) as long as you are using random k. That's the reason why currently you can still reuse the address. The signing itself is pretty safe as long as the algorithm is known. That's why probably the simplest way to implement aethereum is to use the Sign Message function in Bitcoin Core as it has already been vouched for by many people (and it is pretty flexible in terms of the message that can be signed).

"Ethereum has two languages, E-CLL (the language people write in) and ES (the language that contracts execute); I'll answer the question for both separately.

E-CLL is a proof of concept. Right now, it's basically a subset of Python, with the exception that integers are modulo 256. Ultimately, I hope that it gets expanded to cover all of pure Python, and other languages are written that

ES has a few specific requirements:

(i) High level of deduplication. We are in a unique situation where thousands of people's code is stored in a common database where we can choose the format, and we should take advantage of that. Ultimately, I want to erase the distinction between functions, code-blocks and libraries.
(ii) Simplicity. The fewer ops the better.
(iii) Optimization-friendliness.

The question is, what is the right tool for the job?

There are 4 main solutions to the problem:

1. Assembly-like language with jumps
2. Postscript-like language with concatenation and functions
3. Lisp-like language with functions and recursion
4. Some moderately simple language that actual humans code in, like Lua

Ethereum 0.0.1, as old-timers might recall, was purely (1). Then, on the advice of Andrew Miller, Paul Snow and others, I switched to stack-based, but still with jumps. Now, we are looking at something similar to (2). You might notice that ES2 is actually almost exactly like Postscript, except that we are using hashes-as-pointers as a possible alternative to including lists directly and we don't have arrays, dicts, variables or first-class functions. However, Gav Wood's criticism of (2) is that it's imposing a preference for a certain set of control structures (IFELSE, WHILE, function calling) by fiat, whereas a jump-based approach lets the compiler create whatever control structures it wants.

(3) is interesting and highly elegant, primarily because Lisp is designed to be extensible so it might be possible to use an existing Lisp interpreter (although that might also be problematic, since we do heavily rely on 20-32 byte strings and ints and all existing machines are 4-byte or 8-byte). I also like the Lisp approach from a philosophical standpoint, in that it has a very high level of simplicity by reducing everything to functions - an interesting parallel to the assembly approach of reducing everything to jumps. However, my main qualm with Lisp is that Lisp is fundamentally a functional language designed around immutable data structures, and Ethereum is fundamentally a state machine. 

(4) is a bad idea, since humans' coding preferences change. Sure, we can pick a language that people like coding in now. But 10 years down the line, people might invent some completely new paradigm, and we would end up with people writing compilers down to Lua - a much more shaky and untested field than compiling down to register-assembly, or stack, or even Lisp. 

Ultimately, I think the optimal ES design should be decided on based on what the actual applications are that people want to use. We have a person trying to implement a clearinghouse, as well as many other applications, and we'll see how the language can be tweaked to make such applications work better.",0,t1_cf77k0m,t3_1x0ebg,t3_1x0ebg,False,,7,False,Founder,1432254960,1391559453,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cf77k0m,True,0

The fundraiser has been delayed over and over while the development continues, new people are being brought on board, research is being conducted. In funding ethereum at the fundraiser we will thus be voting on whether we like what they've been doing and trust them to continue that way.

So far, I like what the ethereum project is doing. I also trust that we will have plenty more information on their spending plans once the fundraiser is finally underway. And remember, if there is any group of people acutely sensitive to the problem of centralised control, it is these guys.

&gt;The motivating idea for Advogato was to try out in practice Levien's ideas about attack resistant [trust metrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_metric), having users certify each other in a kind of [peer review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) process and use this information to avoid the abuses that plague open community sites. Levien observed that his notion of attack resistant trust metric was fundamentally very similar to the [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm used by [Google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) to rate article interest. In the case of Advogato, the trust metric is designed to include all individuals who could reasonably be considered members of the Free Software and Open Source communities while excluding others.

"&gt; Nobody, including Satoshi had an advantage at any time during the project's history.

Absolutely false IMO. Satoshi had the advantage that he knew about Bitcoin from day 1, and he posted the information on a specific set of forums that he chose and not on other forums. 99.9999%+ of the world's population had no chance whatsoever to do anything with Bitcoin simply because they didn't know about it before 25% of all currency units that will ever exist were released. Meanwhile, in Ethereum, I specifically forced the project to have an infinitely growing currency supply so there is no such thing as ""25% of all currency units that will ever exist"" in the first place.

I think that making distribution models that are ""technically fair"" is a futile task; the best approach is to look at how we can create a distribution model that is as widely dispersed as possible, and that necessarily involves delivering currency units to multiple constituencies.

"Her are my counter arguments to you.


So far judging from the responses on all Ethereum forums here is what I see. Most of the people posting on this forum and almost all the people that were at the Miami Conference praising Ethereum are developers. There is genuine potential for this platform to be groundbreaking if done right. The devs that are shilling for the Ethereum to succeed have either been involved in pre-fund raising before and want to see this succeed for selfish reasons or they believe in Ethereum and are planning to monetize this platform in the future and want to see Ethereum succeed for selfish reasons.

Then you have the other half of the devs that are not involved with the project, see there are too many risks involved and fearful of wall street taking over the crypto industry
.
Where I feel there is a severe disconnect is that the majority of opinions on this forum, Reddit, etc.. are developers and they will constitute less that 1% of the total amount of investment capital that Ethereum is trying to raise.

If you go to a Conference where the entire majority of reporters have a dev background, you are basically looking at the very definition of a biased opinion and reporting. Just because a small group of technology advanced individuals are excited about the possibility of the tech, doesn't actually mean equate a great investment.

Then you have the 99% of the general crypto population that are only interested in making a quick profit on this coin. They are not particularly interested in this new coin/platform and don't really care about the technology and only if there will be enough ROI to justify an initial investment into the pre-sale. Initially, there was a lot of hype on this coin that drew a lot of interest, but crypto investors cannot be duped. They realize they are not getting into this investment at the ground floor level and with the amount of money/bitcoin that Ethereum is trying to raise before launch, there will have to be 100 million dollar market cap for them to see a profit. 

Long-term is the only reason to invest. There are few pump and dump scenarios that will work with this investment structure that Ethereum is proposing because all the initial ""pump"" profit is being taken out of the market and into Ethereum's pocket right from the beginning.

Long term I see a lot of risks involved with pre-sale investment.

1/ There is risk of immediate loss of equity once it hits an exchange.

2/ There is risk of dilution

3/ There is risk of the company dissolving or bankrupting (however small) 

4/ There is risk of this becoming vaporware

5/ There is risk that it will be forked and cloned

6/ There is risk that there will be too many security holes

7/ There is risk that a newer and better technology with greater funding and transparency will enter the market in due time

8/ There is risk that the altcoin (or platform if you want to call it that) crypto market will crash in a few years.

9/ There is a risk (and I personally feel strongly about this) that the price will be considerably lower once it hits an exchange and falls to what the market feels is an appropriate price for the amount of risk and dilution involved with the project.

Of course, I could be wrong and Ethereum totally sells out and there will be another 100 million worth of btc bid aftermarket. But do you really think that crypto investors are dying to jump in to give anyone 100 million on vaporware on a diluted investment? ALL you have to look at is the forum boards and ignore the developers who are shilling for the product to succeed. There is a huge outcry against the current investment scheme. Why are people so vehemently against Ethereum's structure? Because they feel it has a possibility to be an asset to the bitcoin community but not the way its currently structured.

So in final words, whether you believe in the tech or not, all you have to ask yourself is this. Would I be better off investing in the pre-sale or should I invest aftermarket?

There is absolutely only ONE reason you should buy into the pre-sale, if you believe that it will be so much oversold and the market will not feel that it's diluted to the point where there is another huge group of buyers willing to take it off your hands and xxx times a return on your investment right from the beginning of launch.

Now I submit to you a few simple reasons why you should wait until aftermarket to buy-in.

1/ You NEGATE any risk mentioned earlier in the post and you only have to consider risk/reward. If I buy in pre-sale what risk do I take vs the reward I will have for taking that risk. Do you think there is greater chance that the market price will be higher than lower from the pre-sale price? And to what degree do you need to see Ethereum trade at to make this pre-sale investment worth it for you.

2/ Time value - What could have I done with this money invested in Ethereum that will be locked up from pre-sale until launch on a legitimate market. During those two or three months, you could have that money invested in Bitcoin (which has a lot less downside and at the current level has a good chance of increasing in value) or a dozen new altcoins that will be launching that as you can see we are in the midst of a crypto coin boom. How much money will you have lost by freezing your money up in Ethereum, when it could be actively invested in other more profitable ventures where the initial investment is not severely diluted?

3/ During the time you buy into the pre-sale (several months) and the time you are able to trade your ETH on an exchange, I guarantee you there will several new teams announcing a new platform or coin that will get much better press with a better investment structure. You take the risk of obsolescence even before the coin launches.

4/ By buying into the coin pre-sale and making it a success you encourage Wall Street to take over the crypto coin market and in the future you may see an environment where every new coin launch will be diluted and structured in a way that only Wall Street will increase their millions and the RISK will all be burdened by the crypto community. Ethereum will set a new precedent and if you think this will not happen, think again. Miners and crypto investors will be locked out of the early ""pump"" profits while Wall Street makes millions and we will take all the RISK. The early pre-sale investors will essentially be the bagholders.

5/ Here is the most important reason to wait until it hits an exchange to buy into Ethereum, you NEGATE all the risk I mentioned before and plus you do not enable this kind of launch in the future. There is a good chance that you will be able to buy it lower than the offering price of approx a dollar an ETH. and if the price rises a bit, you can still buy in at the pre-sale price or a little bit higher. The only reason you should be buying this pre-sale is if you believe that there is another 100 million waiting in line to buy ETH and there is no risk involved. You have absolutely nothing to lose by waiting and a lot at stake by buying and enabling this type of coin pre-sale launch.

Now, over the next few days I imagine Ethereum will hire a Marketing PR, they will hype and pump the tech and coin and gloss it over to make it look like they invented the wheel. They will cast out all the doubters and call them ""FUD."" Vitalik will come online and answer questions about the tech. But I say to you forget about all that. Don't get caught up in the tech, we all know the tech has the potential to be amazing. Look at the investment structure. Dont let Vitalik use excuses like this is the best way to avoid ""whales"" from taking over the market. That is so naive. Think!!! Regardless of the tech, is it more beneficial to me, considering risk vs reward, to buy pre-sale or buy aftermarket?

If you choose pre-sale, then good luck, all I'm asking you is to forget the tech and the chatter from the devs and focus on the pros and con of the investment only.

"There's no guarantee BTC keeps its value.

Maybe Ethereum come out and is so popular that it ends up increasing in value much more than Bitcoin, at that point, even if Bitcoin has limited supply, people might not want to store value in it long term. That scenario is pretty unlikely, but Bitcoin's ascent from 2009 to now was, too.

Something more interesting is if you are just using Bitcoin as a store of wealth, there are other coins like Peercoin explicitly designed to do that and will do it better. Actually PPC was designed to be the same store of wealth to Bitcoin in the way you are juxtaposing BTC to Ethereum.

"Ether is not stock. Stock is issued by a corporation centrally. In contrast, mining is decentralized and issued slowly, where the price is set by supply from the miners and demand from consumers. If Ethereum really wants to treat ether like stock then there should be no mining what-so-ever: they would be the sole issuers and the public would trade on it on the secondary market; if they needed to raise more funds, they would issue more just like any normal company.

This means any rational investor would stay the hell away from the IPO and just wait till ether comes on the market.

People are going to spend ether for contract execution and for meta-coins.

"&gt; Also, in order to do that, all clients have to keep all data on all software.

You're basically correct, but I'll note that the client does not need to keep full state of every program at every time, just full state of every program at the current time. So the memory requirement is (nBlocks * blockHeaderSize + nTransactions * transactionSize + nContracts * contractMemoryRequirements + currentStateOfBlockchain). So note that nTransactions and nBlocks is going to be at least linear in time (just like Bitcoin) but the contract memory requirements (the most radical change in scalability characteristics from Bitcoin) is proportional to the number of contracts but does not necessarily continually grow over time. (If the memory storage fees were increased, it might actually shrink over time.)

Since there is a fee in Ethereum for the use of all computing resources (memory, CPU, etc), and there is clearly some value in providing contracts, and computing resources are basically very cheap, there must be a set of fees such that (valueOfResource &gt; fee &gt; costOfResource) which implies that Ethereum will continue to be run and be useful to the world.

"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it""  I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.  

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward.  Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

We don't need a Crypto-Microsoft. In fact, we don't need a crypto-Google. We need many competitors and honest competition...otherwise we probably wont like what happens 15-20 years down the road.

Just MHO, take it or leave it, but it is here with the sole intent of providing a non-biased look at things in this space.  I like MasterCoin (dont own them unfortunately), wish I trusted Hoskinson and the other team members who fail to acknowledge those from whom they wish to win the Championship Belt so I could feel good about Ether, and I own a small amount of PTS/AGS.  Longterm holder because I love the Devs, community and await the first Decentralized Bank in Keyhotee Free Space...

"&gt; If some of Maidsafe's technologies rise up to the challenge of crossing this bar then we'll be very happy to use them as our backbone.

We will be glad to see you there as well Vitalik. I believe Ethereum is another great project looking to achieve things never previously imagined.  Its tough, easy, happy and sad all at the same time working at this pace and attempting to read everyone about every project. I will try and summarise some key points regarding MaidSafe and hope it helps. 

We have written many papers and attended many events in this journey. We still find it hard to explain (well I do). I think this is not unusual for a big change. Bitcoin is also hard to explain to some folks. 

We will be launched soon and then will get a chance to measure, tune and check all algorithms. We have had a ton of review though over the years (I started all this in 1996 with a decentralised approach to linux servers that I had designed). In recent years since MaidSafe started (2006) I spent 8 months in a non English place to get peace to do the initial design. I then spent nearly a year travelling around Universities explaining and getting peer review. It's not the be all and end all, but we seek critique everywhere so happy to see it actually. We did work early on and spoke with many people in the field such as Vint Cerf and Deborah Gordon (of the Gordon institute in Stanford), presented at a google conference on scalability and a keynote at the british computer society xmas lecture etc. Also spent a lot of time on kademlia implementation and attacks/designs with Mario Kolberg (one of the the authors in the p2p handbook). A couple of us have spent many years on the cryptopp library (Wei's library) and that's a great place for some pretty deep cryptography questions and ideas. So we search everywhere for valid critique. It is a huge system to describe quickly and that seems to be the main reason for misunderstanding in many cases. None of this is proof of the whole network, but there is a lot of research and testing taken place, including three pre &amp; post doctorate research projects we sponsored for simulation and modelling.  Like everyone we try very hard to make sure we get the system tested as we go along. 

We hope to have some papers soon that further explain some the parts you are discussing or querying here. It may not be obvious or well explained how chained consensus groups work and how they prevent birthday paradox and related sybil type attacks. There was a paper on attack vectors from the data part of the network supposed to be available to the mailing list weeks ago, but it is still waiting on registration for the WWRF forum. We should have posted this paper on  arxiv. 

We will probably try and get the routing paper that explains some of the DHT theory underlying this posted in the next week or so. It will help a lot.  Routing relies on a reliable UDP that has pseudo tcp type connection oriented attributes. This has been worked on by Chris Kohlhoff (of c++ ASIO), Anthony Williams (c++ concurrency) and now another great boost developer Nail Douglas. These parts are critical for full decentralisation of all data in my opinion.

Where single entities (i.e. crypto currencies, structured data version handlers) are involved there are also asymm signatures involved as the chain mechanism cannot work for non group id's.  Currently this is RSA 4096 signatures. So there is a  lot we do not explain in detail, but there is a lot to it all (each client on the network has many crypto key pairs for different aspects, as well as revocation pairs).

I hope this helps folks a little, I think the papers will define more clearly and also show some mathematical modelling of some of these points. ",0,t1_cgblrny,t3_217fsm,t1_cgambcf,False,,7,False,,1433063078,1395768938,dirvine,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,7,,cgblrny,True,0

Yes, as long as it costs the miners less in electricity than the price investors paid, then they can undersell the investors and still make a profit. 

&gt;Those orders will be sucked off the market very rapidly. 

Yes, but the mining supply never stops. This means buyers can always find a better price than what the investors paid at the IPO. As long as the market price is below the IPO, the investors will be stuck with ether they can't sell.

&gt;It's like if you wanted to mine bitcoin and sell them at $100 each. Who is stopping you? But they'll be snatched off the market very, very rapidly.

The difference here is that there is a market price of bitcoin at around $700, meaning that's the best price you can currently get. So you can sell at $100 but you *know* it's below market rate and you could have sold for more. With ethereum's IPO, the developers are just pulling a number out of their hat and *hoping* it's below the market rate.

Distributed applications on Ethereum require payments of a token to fuel every computational and storage operation on the system.  Without requiring payments for operations, the system would be vulnerable to many sorts of attacks and would not be viable or secure.

"Essentially, yes, but the problem is that the number of domains is *enormous*, and we may not want to stuff all that into ethereum. The scalability problem isnt solved yet.

So the Merkle tree structure allows you to put a single checksum in there that allows you prove some entry is in a large data set. But the contract itself cant actually do it. Say you buy `google.com` on our system.. Well, the system cannot stop you, but if we get a message from google that it isnt them, we can prove to the contract that google is in the list of domains. But ones not in the domains like  `not_a_domain.com` we cannot because it isnt in the list.

Of course the list would a snapshot of the domains at some time and be public. There would be an interface to check, probably also used when you are buying.

Tl;dr a technical solution to not loading every domain name on the blockchain requires that domains can be taken away retroactively.

Yes, i have worries how security relates to ethereum, btw. We can hope that mass-compromising machines is hard. We can get specially secured machines for these things, i mean it is near hopeless for regular users, to be frank. There are cheap computers that could be used. There are even various schemes where you use multiple computers.. 

For instance you could have two, plus a small one with a display. The first one talks to the internet and can send data to the second. The second can read that data and you read your emails/browsing there. However you cannot easily follow links, instead if you want to follow a link, it sends it to the tiny computer with display. The display shows what link you followed, and you have to press a button to allow the link to be passed on to the internet-connected computer.

For ethereum/bitcoin transactions, the same would happen, except you'd see the transaction on the display.

"A coordination language is really about building large systems, like the Daemon in Daemon/Freedom. In such systems you might use Ethereum to deal with finances and resources for example, but have other components that deal with other stuff. The different components can be people, servers, algorithms, various software etc. so then a coordination language is used to make all these components composable, so they can all form one integrated system.

For example if one process is a person scanning a specific type of document, then a component could be made that looks for new documents in a folder and the person scanning the documents knows to save all scanned documents in that folder. That component now really encapsulates the scanning software and the person scanning the document, if you were to switch the scanner, the scanning software and the person with, say, a fully automatic scanner, the component would still look and behave in exactly the same way to all the other components in the system. The thing is really about wrapping all the jobs, software, web servers etc in this kind of components, then describe the flow of data, money, resources and things through a network of such components.

Since such components are not necessarily pure software, you can use types that refer to physical objects. For example a component for a 3d printer, can have one input and one output. The input has a CAD model as the type, while the output might have ""ABS plastic thing"" as the type. If the 3d printer was switched to another printer of even injection molding, as long as it takes the same input, the CAD model, and outputs an ABS plastic object, it wouldn't matter for the rest of the system. The output of the 3d printer component might be connected to a robot arm component, that would expect to find an ABS plastic thing at a specific position, but the robot arm does not care how that ABS plastic thing ended up in that specific position, just programming function doesn't care how an integer which is going to be its input, came to existence.

"I agree with some of the article..

But dont confuse anti-pointing cameras and microphones -attached to insecure devices, developped by google. In a context where leaks have indicated the NSA taps everything and is in looking into mass-compromising machines with anti tech sentiment.

Doing so gives the impression for a complete lack of concern for it. Worse, some parties may try spread this sentiment, and then your associated with them. That said, the microphones are just as bad.. But i am glad to see a sign of a line being drawn somewhere.

Yes, i have worries how security relates to ethereum, btw. We can hope that mass-compromising machines is hard. We can get specially secured machines for these things, i mean it is near hopeless for regular users, to be frank. There are cheap computers that could be used. There are even various schemes where you use multiple computers.. 

For instance you could have two, plus a small one with a display. The first one talks to the internet and can send data to the second. The second can read that data and you read your emails/browsing there. However you cannot easily follow links, instead if you want to follow a link, it sends it to the tiny computer with display. The display shows what link you followed, and you have to press a button to allow the link to be passed on to the internet-connected computer.

For ethereum/bitcoin transactions, the same would happen, except you'd see the transaction on the display.

(mind that [security can involve hardware](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Radio-Transmitter/))

Think that the third option misrepresents UBI... I mean the point is that there are no strings attached.. And why would there suddenly be a committee..

"That's a very interesting question only if it is properly understood. The question is a technical one and has to be answered in technical terms. I might add that the question wasn't phrased properly, by my understanding.

&gt; Ether will be released in a fundraiser at the price of 1 ether for 0.0001 BTC. Suppose that X ether gets released in this way.

&gt; 0.25X ether will be allocated to the founders in a time-lock contract that prevents the founders from spending it for one year.

&gt;The **tragedy of the commons** is an [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic) theory by [Garrett Hardin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin), according to which the depletion of a shared [resource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource) by individuals, acting independently and rationally according to each one's self-interest, act contrary to the group's long-term best interests by depleting the common resource. The concept is often cited in connection with [sustainable development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development), meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the debate over [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming). ""Commons"" can include the atmosphere, [oceans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch), rivers, [fish stocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_stocks), [national parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park), [advertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising), and even [parking meters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_meter). The tragedy of the commons has particular relevance in analyzing behavior in the fields of [economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), [evolutionary psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology), [anthropology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), [game theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), [politics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics), [taxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation), and [sociology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology). Some also see the ""tragedy"" as an example of [emergent behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_behavior), the outcome of individual interactions in a [complex system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system).

"I am new into the Ethereum technology, and I am very excited. However, there are some things I don't understand.

&gt;DAOs operate completely transparently without human management, and are no longer subject to voting or other control by their creators or any other stakeholder.

Isn't voting one of the main mechanism to control? For example, escrow is usually based on two out of three voting for a resolution.

&gt;Ethereum can be used to develop, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything, and is limited only by the creativity of developers.

I feel the week point is the interface to the external world. For a contract to be effective in regulating assets outside of Ethereum, and to be able to be triggered by data generated from the outside, a trusted mechanism is needed.

Like many open source projects people have the option to see for themselves or have someone they trust perform due diligence. I expect that within 1 year ethereum will have the most advanced open source reputation system on the planet. Contracts will have their own identity and rating.

The most efficient contract will win out every time. Contracts which are designed to perform malicious behavior will cost more to operate: they'll need additional lines of code to obfuscate yet more code that's designed to steal from your pocket.

"&gt; Namecoin, it is not.. This in turn means that there will never be one unique DNS in Ethereum, just a set of DNSs each different for each contract that creates them.

Yes. Anyone can create a name registar, but probably 90% of the uses will be concentrated in a few. Also you can copy an existing name registrar database to kickstart your own if the previous is found to be buggy.

&gt; Create a currency, it might not be that simple...

Yes it's hard to create currencies and to code exchanges. But people built them in PHP and MYSQL didn't they?

&gt; What is the incentive of creating a useful service?

Maybe the lucrative part is running the business, not creating the contracts. Or maybe auditing contracts might be very profitable, who knows.

&gt; It's all about the interface

I agree. Much is being done still.

&gt; Anything that is voted on that has an impact on the external world outside of Ethereum still has to go through the human filter before it takes an effect.

A Dao is as powerful as whatever it controls. If a DAO is holding millions of dollars in ether, and can contract other services with it, it has real world power. The day drones with 3d printed guns are controlled by a DAO holding crypto-fortune is when we know we're all fucked.

&gt; If Ethereum will be pushing for those units to be used, we might end up with nonsense like the imperial system of units

I agree. I hate the various names. I hope no one uses unless you're printing a fancy paper wallet. In the other hand, I can never remember the small SI units (is pico before nano?) so there's that..

"I think you can actually pay fees in the sub-currency directly, though the price will likely be derived from the ether price using the current exchange rate.

&gt; Allow transaction fees to be paid in the internal currency, and then refund the ether transaction fee to the sender. This solves one major problem that all other ""sub-currency"" protocols have had to date: the fact that sub-currency users need to maintain a balance of sub-currency units to use and units in the main currency to pay transaction fees in.

"I agree. As the risk will be smaller as with BTC-ASIC mining (for Ethereum you can buy mining power flexible via cloud computing - EC2, google,....) there will be a lot of competition and a fast growing mining market. If risk is low, revenue will also be small and small efficiency gains will sort out the profitable to the non-profitables ones. Mining concentration seems to be inevitable with POW. As there seems to be no other good alternative to POW yet, maybe the protocol should be designed to be open for a change even then, if the miners have a lot of power and would not support the change. The fact in BTC that the miners have power over the security of the network AND the rules of the network (if they does not support a software change) AS WELL as the mining fees seems to be a real problem in BTC long term.

"How I understand it, this depends on the contract itself:
**(corrections are welcome)**

In a financial contract, ether can be transferred from one account to another, or stored within a contract under certain rules - like a savings account for example.
In these cases ether can represent Bitcoin or any other Cryptocurrency (a contract can actually sign cross chain transactions or use ""local"" currencies that exist on the ethereum blockchain).
  
In a Daap - Ether will be rewarded to the service provider...

If you are referring to the fees that are paid in ether - currently the model they are working on states that fees will be burnt - so they will basically be trashed and cannot be re-used.

**Edit** - Regarding the fees being destroyed - I am not sure if that is still the plan, as it is highly related to the form of consensus which will be used, and if indeed it will be a hybrid of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.

"Good point. Some contracts may have mechanisms in which payment enters the company that are inherently only via the contract though. A namecoin contract could be used not to only assign a name and public key. They could also provide a payment address. And the namecoin account would be controlled by the company contract. So then you cant just tell the web developer to change the code to avoid the company contract, that hypothetical future browser already decided by the namecoin DNS.

I suppose you could still try loophole the system, by contacting costumers directly, offer a discount or something to use another adress. Suppose you could add a bounty in the company contract where customers can claim that this happened, and employees/stake holders vote for consequences for perpetrayors. (The bounty requires putting some stake that will be taken away, against false claims)

"Our general answer is the following:

1. If you look at Bitcoin itself, there are many altcoins that are strictly superior to Bitcoin (eg. Litecoin has 4x faster confirmations, Primecoin has 10x faster confirmations and a slight social utility benefit, Datacoin lets you insert data), and yet all of them combined have maybe 15% of the market cap that Bitcoin has. Network effects seem to be pretty powerful, though as I often argue not nearly absolute.

2. The number 29.4% is a complete fabrication. There is an endowment of 0.3x the amount sold (ie. 23.07% of the initial supply), but that's not all for ""us"". The point is to use this slice to support anyone involved in core Ethereum development (and later on not-so-core development), of which one quarter has been distributed to several dozen developers over the past five months but three quarters are still unclaimed. Think of it as an alternative distribution slice for those who don't have powerful CPU/GPUs to mine or money to invest. One of our major challenges is figuring out how to decentralize this distribution mechanism over time. 

3. Unlike the altcoin/Bitcoin case, if anyone comes up with an alt-ethereum, because Ethereum is Turing-complete we can fork the functionality right back into Ethereum proper as a contract, where it will gain the benefit of being able to interface directly with an existing ecosystem of currencies, liquid decentralized exchanges, data feeds, etc.",0,t1_cgs1ive,t3_22ylxq,t3_22ylxq,False,,5,False,Founder,1433348291,1397480564,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,5,,cgs1ive,True,0

"Accessing just the current hash would achieve what you say.(edit: afaict it is best to choose as random seed something that is result of each mining attempt, am i wrong? in that view..) There is no 'arms race' as the computing power for running the contracts has to be in range of the full nodes, and this is easily in range for any the miners interested in an attack like this.

Miners can still just win a block, and then not send it on the network if it doesnt suit their (paying clients)bets. Worse, they can monitor the network and only send winning blocks if they are , they then still have a shot at the block reward.

Tried to look at it in depth [here](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/630/contracts-affecting-miner-behavior), tbh i dont think it is a particularly successful analysis.

* For repeated N bets the standard deviation is σ≈sqrt(N)⋅p⋅(1-p) i.e. it keeps going up even for many small bets, so many small bets could add up to incentive to miner collusion.

* I dont really know how miners and betters come together to create their devious schemes. Certainly when there is a single big player and big miner you should be worried. How the big player pays out to third parties might also be important. (if small miners can use that) The size of income that the colluder can rake in depends on who he can create trustful/trustless relations with.

* The commitment scheme can completely protect parties, if failing to provide the random value committed to implies losing accordingly. That approach can be inconvenient.

* Just realized that a *single* contract succeeding at getting non-influencable, non-predictable result would solve the problem for everyone.

* Say block reward is **B** *plain* dropping can be done when **&lt;w&gt; &gt; B + h**, where **h** is the current bet winnings and **&lt;w&gt;** the expected ones.

* Dropping where you watch the network and have a probability **p** to get in your block if you enter it at the last minute, seeing a competitor that implies winnings **c**, you allow the competitor when **c &gt; B+h**, and you try to inject the one you had otherwise, then expectation of earnings **&lt;e&gt; = p(B+h) + c(1-p)**

  But the threshhold for trying is also lowered. 
* Should figure out increase of earnings to miners? Really that depends, if we can figure out how to get that single contract, the analysis would be moot.

"Afaik ethereum uses a key-value system. if you use `contract.storage[H(name_string)+k]=..stuff..`, the values of `k` you never set dont require storage. Would seem to me that allowing too high values of `k` essentially decrease the difficulty for attackers, only needing partial collisions. (I think the allowed range of `k` has to be really large for it to really be a problem though..)

Still i prefer the idea of a separate id-contract . However, the second contract doesnt seem neccessary because k∈{0,1} should be fine.

     contract.storage[H(name_string)] =ethereum_address
     contract.storage[ethereum_address] =name_string           #Optional

"Yeh...Invictus is doing great things too. I also respect Mastercoin and its Devs.  Hoskinson erroneously claims Ethereum to be the first Dapp platform when, in fact Invictus had them beat and is pushing out some good things over the coming months.  

I love competition, but it feels like it is a bit too hyped (as in hype it for maximum profit) and the fact that Hoskinson apparently sees fit to never correct himself makes me wonder if he has more similarities to Bill Gates than Steve Jobs...

Another interesting concept that Invictus used was a model where they themselves competed for initial mining with everyone in the community.  

Ethereum relies on other people to build value on top of them...Invictus says ""we would love to help you, but we are building anyway and investors will get a cut in that in addition to anything other people bring to the table"" (not an actual quote, but the philosophy they have).  Whereas the ""Silicon Valley ""model, as Hoskinson says Ethereum has ""adopted"" utilizes initial founders but gives them a better deal than everyone else...

Whereas I have no issues with that model, I believe it is not as good as the model Invictus attempts to achieve for a sustainable free-market approach.  Ethereum's marketing machine moves to steal the first-movers' advantage away from Invictus, but does so in a way that unfairly takes value away from everyone else in the community and dictates that a large portion of the funds are locked to ANYONE else but the ""founders"", with founders not being ANY community they choose not to let in--sounds just like Silicon Valley and not the part i'm enjoying.  

I also find it interesting there are ex-Goldman Sachs ""founders"", but to make things worse they have a literal pyramid icon makes my tin-foil hat side cringe at best and, at worst, puts them in league with some dirty old-monied bastards and potentially bought out by very Real secret societies that cause many of the problems with which humanity currently deals.  

I sincerely hope people really think about Ethers' Team members' willingness to choose marketing over truth.  Instead of telling people on a Mike how transparent you want to be in the future, stop lying about being the first innovator in the crypto-equities space, let people know who beat you to the punch with an equitable test model and move on with a fair and open competition.  Pump in a market happens, but it doesn't give me confidence in the team pushing Ethereum either...

If Hoskinson came out tomorrow and said ""I apologize for pretending we and the 19-year old we sucked up with our Goldman Sachs money to flaunt as the next Einstein were the first to the crypto-equities table. In reality Vitalik is the brains behind this operation and does deserve respect for his colored-coins idea, but Daniel Larimer and Invictus Innovations were indeed the ones who came up with this idea...which we then basically stole and stamped Vitalik's face on it""  I would then stand up, clap, and put a BTC or five behind them.  

Until then, I think the respectable BTC community members and Devs will recognize this potential motive and be careful who they sign onto moving forward.  Remember your value in this community in the long term relies on your willingness to not only impassion people with your ideas, but also requires the responsibility for admitting when your impassioned words come out sounding like impassioned lies...

We don't need a Crypto-Microsoft. In fact, we don't need a crypto-Google. We need many competitors and honest competition...otherwise we probably wont like what happens 15-20 years down the road.

Just MHO, take it or leave it, but it is here with the sole intent of providing a non-biased look at things in this space.  I like MasterCoin (dont own them unfortunately), wish I trusted Hoskinson and the other team members who fail to acknowledge those from whom they wish to win the Championship Belt so I could feel good about Ether, and I own a small amount of PTS/AGS.

"Our general answer is the following:

1. If you look at Bitcoin itself, there are many altcoins that are strictly superior to Bitcoin (eg. Litecoin has 4x faster confirmations, Primecoin has 10x faster confirmations and a slight social utility benefit, Datacoin lets you insert data), and yet all of them combined have maybe 15% of the market cap that Bitcoin has. Network effects seem to be pretty powerful, though as I often argue not nearly absolute.

2. The number 29.4% is a complete fabrication. There is an endowment of 0.3x the amount sold (ie. 23.07% of the initial supply), but that's not all for ""us"". The point is to use this slice to support anyone involved in core Ethereum development (and later on not-so-core development), of which one quarter has been distributed to several dozen developers over the past five months but three quarters are still unclaimed. Think of it as an alternative distribution slice for those who don't have powerful CPU/GPUs to mine or money to invest. One of our major challenges is figuring out how to decentralize this distribution mechanism over time. 

3. Unlike the altcoin/Bitcoin case, if anyone comes up with an alt-ethereum, because Ethereum is Turing-complete we can fork the functionality right back into Ethereum proper as a contract, where it will gain the benefit of being able to interface directly with an existing ecosystem of currencies, liquid decentralized exchanges, data feeds, etc.",0,t1_cgs1ive,t3_22ylxq,t3_22ylxq,False,,5,False,Founder,1433348291,1397480564,vbuterin,0,t5_2zf9m,ethereum,,5,,cgs1ive,True,0

Remember, you're comparing that to option A), which is that you'll get a price that may have nothing to do with the real-world value of ether. If the IPO is over-priced, then the amount you're over-paying is what goes to the foundation. That's a lot closer to charity than option B)

&gt;You could apply your argument just as well to any IPO in the stock market. IPO investors get a fixed price and sometimes the stock goes down afterwards. Nevertheless, I think if IPOs asked investors to send money and get zero shares in return, just so they have the opportunity to buy shares later like anyone else, they would have a very difficult time raising money.

No, this is not at all like investing in a company's IPO. A company's stock is supposed to pay dividends. Ether pays no dividends. Secondly, a company's stock isn't created out of thin air by some mining process; it's issued by the company whenever they want to raise funds. It's like saying the ethereum devs should just create and sell more ether whenever they need more money. Clearly, that's not the value proposition they're going for.

If there's one question that keeps me awake at night, it's the thought that perhaps everything I've sank my life into for the past 3 years is a technological and ideological dead end, and perhaps traditional centralized institution-based mechanisms based around corporations and banks and governments and incremental innovation respecting the existing establishment are actually the best way for society to move forward in solving the issues that really matter for the majority of people.

If you guys do run a trustless pre-sale, It would set a wonderful precedent.

I'll have to lament here, but it sounds like all purchases with BTC will be transparent in the blockchain, the exchange rate for each purchase will also be transparent, and the genesis block will show that all purchased ether has been generated.

There's just one more important step: ether collection. Will an escrow function be used to hold BTC until ether has been generated/etc. (according to some predefined terms), and will investors be able to collect their investment using a private key?

"From what I've understood so far, Ethereum sounds like a really interesting and potentially transformative idea. The exciting and new thing is the ability to create programmable contracts. I am not interested in making money directly from the currency itself, but rather in the innovative possibilities opened up by the contracts. Unfortunately, the way the currency is being launched might create a barrier to innovation in that actually placing contracts onto the blockchain might turn out to be quite an expensive undertaking (because ether is needed for contract, processing fees etc). In my view for innovation to thrive, ether needs to be cheap and easy to get (by mining).

I think I agree with earlier contributors who have commented that the current plan is a dangerous mix of *great* new idea with a rather ambitious, speculative ""IPO"" style launch; the glitz and the ideas are in tension with one another. A bit reminiscent of dotcom bubble.

And pure PoS systems have to deal with the time-interval issue somehow too, and if just one of the chains uses PoW, they can lockstep all the other chains with that, i reckon..

(Of course with PoW, multiple chains would divide work(hashing) power, and it would be easier to put the attack onto one chain.

"More intrinsic worth?  Who knows.  All we can look at is the size of the monetary base of both, measured in, say USD.

I personally think bitcoin should be the the ""gold"" that backstops global financial systems and ether will be the ""oil"" that fuels the machinery of the emerging economy.

Ethereum has a constant linear issuance model for ether. (http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/04/10/the-issuance-model-in-ethereum/) 

If you believe that Ethereum will become a substate for emerging global and social systems, then it is reasonable to believe that the growth of that economy will be exponential for a period (assuming the traditional S-curve adoption model).  If this is true, the value of ether will track the exponential demand more closely than the linear supply.  And I think bitcoin will do something similar.

In the present economy the financial industry is almost larger than the rest of the economy. :-)  Or at least it seems that way.  I don't think such a financialization skew will apply to the emerging economy since it is inefficient.  And I believe the emerging economy will crush inefficiencies quickly.

"&gt;A signed transaction is an encrypted message, not our private key. What you're talking about using the same private key on a completely different network.

I think that's what the idea actually means. You encrypt a message to proof the ownership of the address. You don't actually give up your private key but rather 'signs' a message using your private key.

Actually ECDSA is pretty flexible in terms of message you can put inside. You can actually use it for something other than transaction. For example you can prove the ownership of an address by signing a message 'Sound_Paper owns this address"" and give the cipher text to other people and they can use your public key to verify that the message originates actually originates from the owner of the address(that's actually what Sign Message function does in Bitcoin Core)

"Why do we need to have enforced rules? What sort of rules?

Afaik Twister basically gives every person a little bit of data that people can access. It has a namecoin-like system to associate things with pretty names.(unlike TOR, see no reason the DHT would have any name other than the 'simple' one, just the one on the blockchain under a name can write to a particular name)

From the [whitepaper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7152), its three 'mostly disjoint parts'; blockchain, Distributed Hash Table(DHT), bittorrent-like thingy. That seems to corroborate that there are no complicated rules to enforce, and i read the blockchain part and it only contains user registrations. Found the paper hard to absorb, so may have missed a bit, but from what i read i am pretty sure there is no tough identity data in the blockchain, or rules to deal with. They probably could simply join namecoin, or ethereum, or even both, by just having a little namespace for both.

Btw about twister, hmm probably you can DHT a string, so doing that to URLs.. So presumably it can do a 'comment anywhere'.. A 'documentation everywhere', with some kind of wiki mechanism would be neat too.

Even with a blockchain, why would clients bother to put any information about namecoin in, they can just use the address namecoin tells them is associated on client side, and the blockchain of whatever system they use only needs to know that address. When they want to go back they can just query back client-side too.

The only place where that seems to be an issue is when the namecoin indicates a change of data, like a pubkey for that system. However, the older key would still be in the namecoin system, so finding back the name should be possible..

Hell, in principle ECDSA pubkeys can be the same accross, though people have worry about the security of often-used ECDSA public keys to the point of suggesting not reusing them. Whenever you receive new coin, you can easily change addresses.

"The base claim here is quite interesting: that tx fees - even in Bitcoin - aren't just a simple trade between the tx sender and a miner, where the sender pays BTC to a miner and the miner processes the (perhaps extra large) transaction. But rather that the rest of the network ""must"" also bear the costs. 

Thus if blocksize were uncapped, the argument goes, miners would process big transactions that are profitable for them (because they receive the entire fee, which exceeds their own costs) but a net loss for the network as a whole (because the cost to the network exceeds the fee). Thus ""tx fees are not a market"" because there's a ""tragedy of the commons.""

One reservation I have is that it's not actually the case that other nodes must bear the cost. They have a choice whether to relay larger transactions and they can set their own blocksize limits. If it becomes unprofitable for the rest of the network to deal in larger blocks, the miners that do will find themselves isolated, will they not? 

More generally, for their to be a tragedy of the commons there needs to be a commons - that is, a rivalrous resource that everyone can consume and that no one can restrict the consumption of. 

For example an unowned lake around which is a ring of houses. If everyone can freely fish the lake, overfishing will destroy it. But the case of Bitcoin or Ethereum seems different: the network node resources seem less like the lake and more like the resources within the houses themselves, where if you allow your house space and tools to be used by others you get to use everyone else's (you get to participate in the HouseShare system). Critically, this does *not* make the housing spaces and tools a commons, because if one is too greedy in their use of other people's things they may simply find themselves cut off from the system by other homeowners.

"I'm not deep into NXT so here's what I see as the differences:

* NXT is trying to do multiple things at the same time, trying to get all the best features of alt coins into it. Ethereum instead is trying to build a platform focused on only on the contracts and Decentralized Apps, imagining that anything useful can be built on top of it

* Neither one of them has released a fully functioning smart contract currency. NXT already has a currency working but contracts AFAIK are ""in the works"". Ethereum is focusing on building the contracts, is currently in POC stage.

* They have different funding mechanisms and different levels of transparency. Ethereum starts with a premine distributed among miners and developers and then new coins will be mined by proof of work, NXT started 100% pre mined and funds are secured using proof of stake

* Ethereum is pledging to be completely open. NXT keeps some of it's development code private and releases open source of the more mature builds. Also NXT has purposefully added a few security bugs that it keeps secret in order to attack any alt coins based on their code, Ethereum has none of that.

"Hi, this is something that matters to me.

But first, I'm not sure I understand your '50 dollars' comment. It's indeed very likely we'll see native mobile Ethereum clients right out of the gate, either built as reference clients, or based on community projects. These will be free, as I'd expect them to be. For reference, see this potential Objective-c Client project: http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/629/ethereum-objectivec. Android is a no-brainer.

Second, these clients will support any Ethereum Dapps. We're already factoring mobile phone displays for the distributed GUIs powering Ethereum, either as HTML and/or QT packages spread across bitttorrent nodes. On that topic, I encourage you to read this article by our CTO Gavin Wood at http://insightsintoamodernworld.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/apps-what-web-30-looks-like.html. It's very early days, but Gavin will be presenting mockups of this type of interface at our London event on May 9th. Don't think smart contracts, think 'decentralized web'.

Third, an anecdote: Emerging economies tend to skip technology generations. For example, in the Philippines few have landlines, but smart phones are everywhere. In Kenya, by 2009, mobile payments had already been adopted by 40 percent of the adult population, facilitating ~10 percent of the country's GDP. This may not mean much to you, but you should have seen the Billions invested by companies back then in Europe, attempting to push 'mobile payments' as a 'thing'. Project Oscar would like a word, please (http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/project-oscar-mobile-payments)

Finally, and this is my favorite topic, using reputation in place of collaterals. In Europe, when you need a loan, you use your house or car to 'back' the loan so to speak. What about countries where people do not necessarily have such assets? Are they out of luck? Well, in East Africa, Chamas (social groups - thank you John Samson Karanja for introducing me to them) could be a solution. Peers vouch for a group member, literally collateralizing debt with reputation. I'd love nothing more but to see this system operating globally, as opposed to the local communities where it currently strives. 

This is when one realizes that not only emerging economies could benefit from a project such as Ethereum (Somalia, with its absent rule of law, might be a prime candidate), but that actually, our own economies have a thing or two to learn on the topic. Microfinance, decentralized crowdfunding, and peer to peer insurance could indeed be the saving graces of many countries' economies.

"Wait a second here - and please forgive me as I'm *very* new to all of this.  In fact, if I'm missing something here please tell me.

The fact that a ""company"" wouldn't remain in business due to scrutiny makes sense.  But we're talking about easy to write, simple to duplicate scripts that could be directed at ripping someone off.

Let's say someone says there is a contract/service that will put incoming money into an escrow account or protect it in some way.  As a developer I'm very familiar with conditional branches and I'm just as familiar with the difficulty humans have in following conditionals - especially when math or edge cases crop up.

I believe in open source code and your arguments are used in support of it.  However I get the impression that these contracts are more like snippets of JavaScript, written for specific applications.  People used to trust these snippets because they were designed for a very specific purpose, but even though the source was plainly available they generally weren't reviewed by any number of people.  Remember all the extra bullshit people had inadvertently placed on their MySpace profiles when that was popular?  A huge proportion of users cannot or *will* not read even the most rudimentary code snippets.

The difference between Amazon and some scammer using Ethereum is that Amazon would be gutted alive by the legal system, has reputation to lose, and would almost certainly be subject to reversal of charges if the contracts were found to be misleading.  For non-technical users, /u/loveopenly has a valid point.

"A)

&gt; One of the many ways we intend to foster inclusiveness is by maintaining an issuance system which possesses some churn.  New participants in the system will be able to purchase **new** ETH or mine for new ETH whether they are living in the year 2015 or 2115.


What do you mean ""purchase **new** ether""?. 

In the text you explain Ether is created only for for investors in the pre-sale (not saying how many ether will be mined for the ethereum team), and the rest of the ether has to be mined, reducing the issuance over time just like bitcoin. But then you say new participants can either mine it or ""buy **new** ether"".

So? from where does this ""new"" ether come from?

B)

&gt; ""Though the issuance of ETH is in a fixed amount each year, the rate of growth of the monetary base (monetary inflation) is not constant.""


As far as i understand, one thing is a fixed issuance and another a fixed growth rate. Fixed issuance means that, for example 18,000,000 ethers will be created each year, 18,000,000 in 2014 and also 18,000,000 in 2140. But if the growth of the monetary base is supposed to shrink via mining reward reduction how can you issue 18,000,000 in 2140?

So? Is someone aside miners issuing Ether?

C)

&gt; ""And the constant issuance, especially in the early years, will likely make using ETH to build businesses in the Ethereum economy more lucrative than hoarding speculatively."" 


I'm not a selfish man but i'm in for the speculative side of the game, while i admit a don't understand very well the text you guys just posted,reading that last line makes me think, why would i invest in early stages of ethereum if i can't play the speculative game?

* Since Ether is necessary for development, part of the money of the initial campaign would necessarily go to buy Ether from miners at market value (in fact a market would be the first app that would need to be developed)

* The real financial incentive would be to mine. Even if you have a powerful computer and coding skills, you would probably gain more by using your development machine into a mining rig.

* There is less transparency of how the money is used, and no part on it will be locked into a contract. AFAIK part of the ether reward for the developers will be locked into a vesting contract so they will not be able to sell it for a few years.

* This isn't 2009: there are lots of Mine by Night groups, people that are ready to mine in any new coin to get some of it, without any real stake on the development, they could mine Ethereum today and scam coin tomorrow if it's more profitable.
