Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

unknownstranger2,,,"Algo Market 2020: a revised Tokenomics by the Economic Advisory Committee 

January 2, 2020

Introduction:

 In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. 

New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivalled scalability.

At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:

1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019.

 During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.

2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.

3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. 

The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation.

These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. 

The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. 

As confirmed by the observation of market returns and
volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.

The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially
by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards.

Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.

Conditional Vesting:

 The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report.

 The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). 

In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. 

This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.

The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.

In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. 

This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

New Sales Target:

 In its first communication a few days after the inaugural auction, the freshly appointed EAC pointed out that, in spite of the high participation and fundraising results of the auction, some auction features could be responsible for the initial high Algo volatility and speculative downward trend. One of these features was the 90% Refund, a right owned by the auction buyers only, and not directly associated with the Algos bought at auction.

On August 1, the Early Redemption of Auction Refund was announced: auction buyers could receive 85% early redemption if they transferred Algos back to the Foundation.

This way 19.9M Algos, out of a total of 25M Algos sold at the auction, were permanently retired from supply and eventually burnt by the Foundation.

The total supply from direct Foundation sales, planned to approach 1B over 2019 and 2020, was eventually amounted to around 6M in 2019. Now the Foundation has decided to resume sales to fund research and ecosystem development, but with a maximum possible amount of 150M in 2020, and will structure the sales to have the minimum impact on the market dynamics. Reformed Participation Rewards

The Participation Rewards in Algorand are distributed evenly to everyone. Even if the Algo has a fixed supply, so that no permanent devaluation is possible, such an even distribution can have an inflationary effect in the short or medium term. This becomes more likely if the amount of rewards is a high percentage of the circulating supply.

Considering the above reductions of circulating supply, the originally planned rewards
had become unsustainable. In order to remain consistent with the reduced supply
implemented by the Foundation the rewards had to be adjusted, and this has been recently implemented by the Foundation, choosing a gradual adjustment detailed in: https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics 

This is likely to have no effect on the Algo holders, since what is not obtained by rewards can now be obtained by Algo stability and strength due to supply moving more in harmony with demand.

Market Analysis:
 
 The quantitative analysis of the market dynamics confirms that the Algo market is
headed in the right direction. Price volatility was near to 150% in the first three months after the inaugural auction, but it has almost halved to 77% in the three months after the first reforms. The average daily return has moved from -2.43% in the first three months to 0.4% in the last quarter of 2019. These results are confirmed by regression of the Algo price against the Bitcoin price, the benchmark of the cryptocurrency market. The correlation between Algo and Bitcoin remains rather high, as expected, and regression shows a beta around 70% which is stable across the whole Algo life. But the alpha, representing the relative strength of the Algo vs Bitcoin, has moved from less than -2% in the first three months to more than +0.4% in the last three-month period, a figure indicating a stable market headed for moderate, steady growth.

Conclusion:

 The Algorand governance has proven able to address the over-supply issue. This was
made possible by a responsive community participating in the economic reform, partly
guiding and partly following the Foundation efforts towards stability and steady growth.

The new year sees the Algo start with both enhanced technology and enhanced crypto economics, where supply growth has been thoroughly reformed and brought in line with the growth of demand, the quantitative fundamentals appear strong, and the platform appears ready to host those applications that can only flourish under superior technology and stable economy.",True,0,1599004661,,False,0,g3nr3o7,t3_ikllho,t3_ikllho,1611467736.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/ikllho/algorand_exposed_insider_nodes_insider_whales/g3nr3o7/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1489635157.0,t2_1686ym,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,,,[],,,False,[],,,,,

bigjohnston111,,,"You’re not entirely correct. There is more than meets the eye. The relay nodes are not decentralized. Reward earning relay nodes are whitelisted much like XRP.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.

Thanks for your insights! I like that spirit of people generally believing this is a great project. But yeah, it's dangerous if the auctions likely turn out harmful for early investors.  
Where did you find the information about 25M being released every two weeks? I did not notice that in the token dynamics even though I was already wondering about the graph being continuous and not a step function.  


About the 2.5B tokens for the foundation: Yeah I'm worried about that, too.  In the AMA video Steve Kokinos brushed this off pretty fast by pointing out that this makes the network more secure. Well, and centralized. For example comparing it to Cardano, the foundation holds a modest 5 / 45 B tokens. Algorand starting with a quarter of the whole assets raises an eyebrow. I don't think it's bad intention, but pretty bad practice.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

njbsuperman,,,"Many people that did advertising for the doge, had the right idea... at least in the way of Advertisement. The best way of advertising is by word of mouth. With Algorand... the project and coin speaks for itself at this point and many will start noticing as time goes on.

With regards to getting Algorand well known possibly comes with two problems:

\- The individuals that sell off causing it to drop hard, while they could have just HELD much longer and earned a much higher profit

\- And the individuals that pump and dump, causing some people to lose, resulting in several people not wanting to ""invest"" into this great project/coin.

However, if one is wanting to get noticed, then one can take from the playbook from doge or the reddit groups itself or at least from the old gaming groups :

\- Set a date/time event that everyone can agree to do something spectacular for the Algorand project that helps it get noticed.

\- Have volunteer Recruiters... People that go out to explain the benefits of investing into Algorand.

\- Talk about the project while in game chats or discuss at popular events and give them information that helps them find it.

\- Find out if the Algorand project team is okay with creating promotional items to help advertise (T-Shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, hats, pens, personal blogs that are searchable, etc)

The decision to jump into a Dutch auction, or to buy or sell at any price, is ours- so take responsibility. There have been a few cases of companies that truly did have unethical practices, which is why we need to do our due diligence. Algorand isn’t one of those companies, from my research.

I just don’t think this project justifies a top ten market cap until more projects build on it.

I'm in a wait-and-watch mode with this project.. my guess is they will likely be one of the POS systems along with ETH, Tezos and Cardano to survive the alt coin winter.  

Why is price falling with the Coinbase listing?  Well the  Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were  constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy  just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different  now.

Furthermore, their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed  to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential  was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking  rewards.

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In  order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a   diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,   and other research institutions volunteered to support the network   prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while   also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true   decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the   Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand   protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For  their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created  to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.   The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept  online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It   is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness   of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.   However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to   selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In  response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase  the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher  rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of  time.* 

*This   will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics  while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to  support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a  decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.   Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the  federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research  institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market  causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's  time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and  started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.   Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They  didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups  benefited from your hard earned cash.

In  response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a  means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by  ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the  select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part  of these groups.

Considering the vast majority of the legitimate science and research in this industry is open source, anyone can adopt any tech at any time.  What's going to be the difference maker is the relationships and that's where Cardano is overwhelmingly ahead. 

That said, anyone is free to adopt the technology Cardano has spent many millions of dollars to produce. The only problem is that in order to make a change, you would have to demonstrate that you better understand the tech in a way that your proposal is actually better than Cardano.  If not, then why not just use Cardano? Conversely if Algorand produces groundbreaking science, Cardano will adopt it if it improves the project.  IOHK would be relieved to have someone else do the heavy lifting for once, the science and research path is quite expensive.

Better tech can come along as it should, but a project that is structured in a way to be agile and adopt new ideas and approaches without having to hard fork is formidable long term.

CH is constantly criticized for traveling but he is obviously doing the hard work that will propel Cardano to the future despite any Libra or Amazon or Google ventures that come along.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part of these groups.",True,0,1566158962,,False,0,exct5it,t3_cpgh9o,t3_cpgh9o,1574434894.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/cpgh9o/coinbase_listing/exct5it/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part of these groups.",True,0,1566158962,,False,0,exct5it,t3_cpgh9o,t3_cpgh9o,1574434894.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/cpgh9o/coinbase_listing/exct5it/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Estabelecidos para oferecer uma oportunidade para alunos e professores ingressarem na comunidade Algorand, participarem da inovação disruptiva e contribuírem para a nova economia do conhecimento sem fronteiras, os membros fundadores compartilham a visão da Fundação Algorand sobre o potencial do blockchain como uma força para a justiça social e global. Boa.
Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Cardano has missed deadlines so many times and this is reflected in the price. When asked about the big end of August announcement that didn't happen, Charles replied ""FU you piece of..."".

When Dan Larimer kicked Charles out of BitShares years ago, he said: ""Charles is a salesman that tells everyone what they want to hear and has no compulsion with stretching the truth to absurd lengths or telling outright lies.""

Charles is a very smart guy and Cardano will probably be a great coin, but he is also an over confident narcissist and there seems to be truth in that quote with regards to why there are so many missed deadlines, and why the Cardano ICO was in 2015 and it is still just a centralized token to this day. It took weeks before Charles addressed the missed ""Shelly in Q2"" deadline, and when he did address it, it was with a serious attitude and no mea culpa.

Cardano won't have a real mainnnet until Shelley is live and they will start with 100% permissioned nodes and work down to 0. Once Shelley is actually live, yeah Cardano should go higher.

Algorand also needs to open up it's node relays to not be permissioned, my guess is before Shelley is 0% permissioned.

Did you know Algorand's inventor Silvio Micali is co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs as well as the VRF central to the consensus of both Algorand and Cardano?

What are you excited about with Cardano, Shelley, Plutus, Marlowe, etc? Maybe even Atala? 

With Algorand, I'm excited about:

JesterBombs,,,"Yes ALGO is getting destroyed but my analysis shows despite the price decline more buys are initiated than sells.  Some of these 10% drops were fueled by less than $50k USD of volume.  I would argue that this is a major accumulation before price recovers and that price can move upwards just as easily.  Will it ever break back above $2, $1 or $0.50?  I don't know.  There's too many unknown variables.  That said, ALGO does check a lot of boxes when it comes to the team and tech in the crypto space and only a fool would neglect the fact that they've secured $200 million to grow and expand the Algorand network.  It is a significant advantage for it to trade on two of the most popular exchanges in Binance and CoinbasePro (to NY residents no less).  


I believe price may drop as low as \~$0.13 and that it is likely to retest the $0.31 to $0.45 within the next 12 months, excellent risk/reward for me.

Every wallet automatically earns staking rewards as long as they have at least 1 Algo; you do not have to actively do anything to earn rewards.

If you do want to participate in the consensus-making protocol, you need to run a participation node, generate a limited-duration participation key, and then publish that key by ""going online"". Further information can be found on the [Algorand developer website](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/creating-new-account-and-participation-key).

Jaysallday,,,"As someone who went through alt season in 2017-18, what we are currently seeing is much different. 

Last time complete speculation was what was driving the price on the majority of ICO's. Teams needed a white paper and an idea and fools were giving them ETH and BTC in exchange for future wishful promises. 

Now we see DeFi projects, and new innovative block chain platforms dominating the market cap charts. Many of these have actual value propositions behind them or actual working new technological advances over the current big dogs Eth and Btc. 

And we are seeing large institutions actually starting to massively invest in a few big coins. This is massive amounts of new money, much of which will likely trail down into the projects below which actually deserve it. 

All of this is to say, I do not think we are in a situation like 2018 again.

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"I posted this in another thread...  fwiw, I'm very interested in this project as they're doing some really interesting work in the POS space and their tech does seem promising... the tokenomics are troubling at these early stages.  I'm in a wait-and-watch mode with this project.. my guess is they will likely be one of the POS systems along with ETH, Tezos and Cardano to survive the alt coin winter.  

Why is price falling with the Coinbase listing?  Well the  Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were  constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy  just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different  now.

Furthermore, their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed  to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential  was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking  rewards.

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In  order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a   diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,   and other research institutions volunteered to support the network   prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while   also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true   decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the   Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand   protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For  their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created  to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.   The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept  online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It   is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness   of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.   However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to   selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In  response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase  the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher  rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of  time.* 

*This   will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics  while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to  support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a  decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.   Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the  federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research  institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market  causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's  time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and  started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.   Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They  didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups  benefited from your hard earned cash.

In  response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a  means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by  ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the  select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part  of these groups.

I want to see better supply distribution and more transparency regarding num nodes and disbursement along with TPS and other metrics holding the waterline before I'm a buyer.

bigjohnston111,,,"Serious issues with this article. Who writes this stuff? Either they don’t understand or they are purposefully misleading. Where do we begin?

1. “The platform chooses the token holders irrespective of the size of their stake.” - This is patently false if referring to Algorand. I won’t even put it in my own words. Algorand clearly explains this. 

“What makes this protocol pure proof-of-stake is the fact that users are chosen to participate in the protocol based on the stake (number of algos) that they have. The VRF behaves similarly to a weighted lottery; it is as if every algo in an account gets its own lottery ticket. The more algos in an online account, the better chance the account has of being selected to participate.”

[See: Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/what-we-do/technology/protocol-overview)

2. “Algorand can offer an alternative to other platforms such as Ethereum and EOS in the DeFi space.” - Makes a statement of offering an alternative but fails to explain why.

3. “Algorand has several features that make it stand apart from other platforms in the market.” - states several features, does not name anything after the sentence then offers it at the end of the article. 

4. “The platform promises and delivers speed, security, and decentralization.” - does not deliver decentralization if the backbone of the network is incentivized only for a select (i.e., centralized) group. Not many people open and run a business to lose money. Non-profits even need operational expenses. To think that  thousands of relay node operators will donate their time, effort, and resources to run the network is absurd. If that’s the case, do not reward the current reward earning relay node operators and find out where this will lead.

5. “ Algorand has another advantage over other DeFi platforms: creating and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications on Algorand is cheaper than other platforms.” - what empirical data is referenced to support this statement?

6. “Compared to other blockchains in the DeFi and smart contract space, The Algorand platform has lower costs for creating, deploying, and running smart contracts and decentralized applications.” - Where is the empirical data to support the position? What data/study is being referenced?

unknownstranger2,,,"Algo Market 2020: a revised Tokenomics by the Economic Advisory Committee 

January 2, 2020

Introduction:

 In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. 

New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivalled scalability.

At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:

1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019.

 During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.

2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.

3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. 

The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation.

These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. 

The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. 

As confirmed by the observation of market returns and
volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.

The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially
by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards.

Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.

Conditional Vesting:

 The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report.

 The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). 

In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. 

This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.

The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.

In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. 

This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

New Sales Target:

 In its first communication a few days after the inaugural auction, the freshly appointed EAC pointed out that, in spite of the high participation and fundraising results of the auction, some auction features could be responsible for the initial high Algo volatility and speculative downward trend. One of these features was the 90% Refund, a right owned by the auction buyers only, and not directly associated with the Algos bought at auction.

On August 1, the Early Redemption of Auction Refund was announced: auction buyers could receive 85% early redemption if they transferred Algos back to the Foundation.

This way 19.9M Algos, out of a total of 25M Algos sold at the auction, were permanently retired from supply and eventually burnt by the Foundation.

The total supply from direct Foundation sales, planned to approach 1B over 2019 and 2020, was eventually amounted to around 6M in 2019. Now the Foundation has decided to resume sales to fund research and ecosystem development, but with a maximum possible amount of 150M in 2020, and will structure the sales to have the minimum impact on the market dynamics. Reformed Participation Rewards

The Participation Rewards in Algorand are distributed evenly to everyone. Even if the Algo has a fixed supply, so that no permanent devaluation is possible, such an even distribution can have an inflationary effect in the short or medium term. This becomes more likely if the amount of rewards is a high percentage of the circulating supply.

Considering the above reductions of circulating supply, the originally planned rewards
had become unsustainable. In order to remain consistent with the reduced supply
implemented by the Foundation the rewards had to be adjusted, and this has been recently implemented by the Foundation, choosing a gradual adjustment detailed in: https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics 

This is likely to have no effect on the Algo holders, since what is not obtained by rewards can now be obtained by Algo stability and strength due to supply moving more in harmony with demand.

Market Analysis:
 
 The quantitative analysis of the market dynamics confirms that the Algo market is
headed in the right direction. Price volatility was near to 150% in the first three months after the inaugural auction, but it has almost halved to 77% in the three months after the first reforms. The average daily return has moved from -2.43% in the first three months to 0.4% in the last quarter of 2019. These results are confirmed by regression of the Algo price against the Bitcoin price, the benchmark of the cryptocurrency market. The correlation between Algo and Bitcoin remains rather high, as expected, and regression shows a beta around 70% which is stable across the whole Algo life. But the alpha, representing the relative strength of the Algo vs Bitcoin, has moved from less than -2% in the first three months to more than +0.4% in the last three-month period, a figure indicating a stable market headed for moderate, steady growth.

Conclusion:

 The Algorand governance has proven able to address the over-supply issue. This was
made possible by a responsive community participating in the economic reform, partly
guiding and partly following the Foundation efforts towards stability and steady growth.

If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously.

Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.

\- And the individuals that pump and dump, causing some people to lose, resulting in several people not wanting to ""invest"" into this great project/coin.

However, if one is wanting to get noticed, then one can take from the playbook from doge or the reddit groups itself or at least from the old gaming groups :

\- Set a date/time event that everyone can agree to do something spectacular for the Algorand project that helps it get noticed.

\- Have volunteer Recruiters... People that go out to explain the benefits of investing into Algorand.

\- Talk about the project while in game chats or discuss at popular events and give them information that helps them find it.

\- Find out if the Algorand project team is okay with creating promotional items to help advertise (T-Shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, hats, pens, personal blogs that are searchable, etc)

_Jay-Bee_,,,"The layer 1 smart contracts are via the TEAL bytecode scripts which are limited in execution size and cost and do not allow loops, which is how they keep the current 1000 TPS at layer 1:

""The TEAL bytecode plus the length of any Args must add up to less than 1000 bytes (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxSize). Each TEAL op has an associated cost estimate and the program cost estimate must total less than 20000 (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxCost). Most ops have an estimated cost of 1, but a few slow crypto ops are much higher.""

https://developer.algorand.org/docs/teal

While the TEAL scripts have limits, combined with ASA (custom tokens) and atomic transfers meets many use cases without requiring layer 2 smart contracts (which will be added in the future).

Such as:

* escrow accounts
* Loan payments
* Limit orders
* Subscriptions
* Collateralized obligations/loans

_Jay-Bee_,,,"The layer 1 smart contracts are via the TEAL bytecode scripts which are limited in execution size and cost and do not allow loops, which is how they keep the current 1000 TPS at layer 1:

""The TEAL bytecode plus the length of any Args must add up to less than 1000 bytes (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxSize). Each TEAL op has an associated cost estimate and the program cost estimate must total less than 20000 (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxCost). Most ops have an estimated cost of 1, but a few slow crypto ops are much higher.""

https://developer.algorand.org/docs/teal

While the TEAL scripts have limits, combined with ASA (custom tokens) and atomic transfers meets many use cases without requiring layer 2 smart contracts (which will be added in the future).

Such as:

* escrow accounts
* Loan payments
* Limit orders
* Subscriptions
* Collateralized obligations/loans

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

That is from the official website but doesn’t massively clear up the methodology for me... also interestingly I was under the impression that only 1-1.5bio had been put into circulation so far (coinbase data), but according to Algorand that figure is above 3.5bio of which (as you say) 2.3bio is currently being staked.

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

Additionally, looking at Slack\[NYSE:WORK\] went IPO and the market cap as of now is $21 billion; I believe we are still in the stages of valuing the blockchain first companies and the token itself and Algorand's valuation between $3-7 billion at this stage does not surprise me.",True,0,1561142517,,False,0,erqg1pf,t3_c17szn,t1_erq79a1,1570476432.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c17szn/is_ada_going_to_win_against_algorand/erqg1pf/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1284768643.0,t2_4cqmz,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Market cap is more relevant to mergers and acquisitions, neither of which applies when someone buys the majority share of any given token.  If Amazon has a bad day Bezos could lose billions of dollars... IF he sells his holdings at those lower prices.  Any major transfer of shares is regulated by the SEC and the bottom line is that market cap applies in that regard.  If everyone dumped Amazon at the same time the price and market cap would temporarily suffer but the fundamentals of Amazon are intact and price will adjust accordingly.  In that respect the same is true here except we don't know what Algorand will be able to accomplish in the future which is grounds to justify the price (and panic selling from reading articles like that).  In summary, if Algorand keeps building their network, offers benefits that other cryptos do not and increases usage the price will adjust accordingly and for reasons we simply won't know for sure until it happens.

**TL;DR:**  
1) *True Decentralization solved* \-- How? The network is not controlled by a few miners or validator set since proposers and committees are randomly selected using Cryptographic sortition and VRF. This means 'node centralization' 'stakes centralization' doesn't happen. Network scales as nodes scale and adversary due to true randomness never know whom to target.  
2) *Scalability* \-- How? Algorand is scalable as nodes on network grow. Algorand gives instant finality (1-4 sec blocktime) unlike other non-final POS/ POW blockchains. The entire community agrees on the next block and confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users.  
3) *Security* \-- How? True randomness, no select group to target, no mining centralization, instant finality rending fork probability as zero. Secure against Static, Dynamic and Network adversaries.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

[deleted],,,"**The Supply Cap**

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

The supply is capped at 10 billion.  There will never be more than 10 billion algo and all 10 billion already exists.  It is given out over time or sold to incentivize things like network growth and people setting up nodes.

[https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter](https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter)

Out of the 10 billion, 803 million are currently circulating.

Most websites show the market cap (total value of all the coins) for Algorand at 247 million so they must be only calculating that market cap for the total coins in circulation.

Because at the current price of 0.298  per algo that's a **2.9 billion usd market cap** when we account for all 10 billion coins.  For comparison **Bitcoin's market cap is 266 billion** right now, when we account for all 21 million bitcoin's that will exist.

Ethereum doesn't even have a supply cap, so it'll just keep inflating forever making it's future market cap infinite.

So I don't think algorand's market cap is too high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Supply Rate**

But I imagine most people are concerned with the Supply rate.  Which is how fast are Algor and being given out (for things like staking) and put into circulation?

And the answer is, it appears to be that it's being managed by the team.

Here's a quote from the website:

*"" In the foreseeable future, it is our primary goal at the Foundation to increase the amount of rewards in line with the growth of the circulating supply corresponding to community feedback and market conditions. ""*

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

So it's kind of like how a central bank manages an economy, and they are adjusting rewards and things in real time to promote maximum growth.

Many crypto enthusiasts probably dislike this because it's people making decisions, and people can become corrupt or make bad decisions and they want everything coded in stone.

But I would argue that a bunch of game theoretic geniuses adjusting variables in real time with the financial goal of growing the value of Algorand (because that's how they can get rich also), is actually a good thing.

Take for example, staking rewards.  Algorand is the only cryptocurrency for which staking rewards are being offered by both coinbase custody and binance, so obviously these game theory guys are doing the right things to maximize adoption, especially considering there are plenty of cryptocurrencies that have been around longer and still haven't achieved that.

Those rewards should increase crypto bank adoption as well, banks make a percentage of that income.  All of this increases faster adoption and growth.

What these changing rates mean for the price, is that the price short term is less predictable because the inflation is less predictable so the rate of inflation's effect on the price is less predictable.  This risk can be greatly mitigated if you just stake the algorand that you do have, which is not difficult and anyone can do.

But knowing it's all being done, most likely, to maximize growth of the network is good, because that reflects in a price increase.  I'm welcome to hear other opinions on this.  I'm just reading and learning like everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Msc.**

As far as burned tokens that's 19.9m.  But that's a pretty small amount relative to the market cap, so I wouldn't worry about it.  Burning a token is when it's removed forever from supply.

That being said the $10 upper end  and frequent auctions are there to discourage whale accumulation. If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously. This was done to stop large BTC holders basically controlling the coin from day one as they do with most icos it's to encourage a more diverse spread in market and hopefully stop market manipulation.

Facebook had meetings with algorand many times late last year and earlier this year. 


Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.

bigjohnston111,,,"Serious issues with this article. Who writes this stuff? Either they don’t understand or they are purposefully misleading. Where do we begin?

1. “The platform chooses the token holders irrespective of the size of their stake.” - This is patently false if referring to Algorand. I won’t even put it in my own words. Algorand clearly explains this. 

“What makes this protocol pure proof-of-stake is the fact that users are chosen to participate in the protocol based on the stake (number of algos) that they have. The VRF behaves similarly to a weighted lottery; it is as if every algo in an account gets its own lottery ticket. The more algos in an online account, the better chance the account has of being selected to participate.”

[See: Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/what-we-do/technology/protocol-overview)

2. “Algorand can offer an alternative to other platforms such as Ethereum and EOS in the DeFi space.” - Makes a statement of offering an alternative but fails to explain why.

3. “Algorand has several features that make it stand apart from other platforms in the market.” - states several features, does not name anything after the sentence then offers it at the end of the article. 

4. “The platform promises and delivers speed, security, and decentralization.” - does not deliver decentralization if the backbone of the network is incentivized only for a select (i.e., centralized) group. Not many people open and run a business to lose money. Non-profits even need operational expenses. To think that  thousands of relay node operators will donate their time, effort, and resources to run the network is absurd. If that’s the case, do not reward the current reward earning relay node operators and find out where this will lead.

5. “ Algorand has another advantage over other DeFi platforms: creating and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications on Algorand is cheaper than other platforms.” - what empirical data is referenced to support this statement?

6. “Compared to other blockchains in the DeFi and smart contract space, The Algorand platform has lower costs for creating, deploying, and running smart contracts and decentralized applications.” - Where is the empirical data to support the position? What data/study is being referenced?

Last time complete speculation was what was driving the price on the majority of ICO's. Teams needed a white paper and an idea and fools were giving them ETH and BTC in exchange for future wishful promises. 

Now we see DeFi projects, and new innovative block chain platforms dominating the market cap charts. Many of these have actual value propositions behind them or actual working new technological advances over the current big dogs Eth and Btc. 

And we are seeing large institutions actually starting to massively invest in a few big coins. This is massive amounts of new money, much of which will likely trail down into the projects below which actually deserve it.

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand.

The supply is capped at 10 billion.  There will never be more than 10 billion algo and all 10 billion already exists.  It is given out over time or sold to incentivize things like network growth and people setting up nodes.

[https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter](https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter)

Out of the 10 billion, 803 million are currently circulating.

Most websites show the market cap (total value of all the coins) for Algorand at 247 million so they must be only calculating that market cap for the total coins in circulation.

Because at the current price of 0.298  per algo that's a **2.9 billion usd market cap** when we account for all 10 billion coins.  For comparison **Bitcoin's market cap is 266 billion** right now, when we account for all 21 million bitcoin's that will exist.

Ethereum doesn't even have a supply cap, so it'll just keep inflating forever making it's future market cap infinite.

So I don't think algorand's market cap is too high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Supply Rate**

But I imagine most people are concerned with the Supply rate.  Which is how fast are Algor and being given out (for things like staking) and put into circulation?

And the answer is, it appears to be that it's being managed by the team.

Here's a quote from the website:

*"" In the foreseeable future, it is our primary goal at the Foundation to increase the amount of rewards in line with the growth of the circulating supply corresponding to community feedback and market conditions. ""*

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

So it's kind of like how a central bank manages an economy, and they are adjusting rewards and things in real time to promote maximum growth.

Many crypto enthusiasts probably dislike this because it's people making decisions, and people can become corrupt or make bad decisions and they want everything coded in stone.

But I would argue that a bunch of game theoretic geniuses adjusting variables in real time with the financial goal of growing the value of Algorand (because that's how they can get rich also), is actually a good thing.

Take for example, staking rewards.  Algorand is the only cryptocurrency for which staking rewards are being offered by both coinbase custody and binance, so obviously these game theory guys are doing the right things to maximize adoption, especially considering there are plenty of cryptocurrencies that have been around longer and still haven't achieved that.

Those rewards should increase crypto bank adoption as well, banks make a percentage of that income.  All of this increases faster adoption and growth.

What these changing rates mean for the price, is that the price short term is less predictable because the inflation is less predictable so the rate of inflation's effect on the price is less predictable.  This risk can be greatly mitigated if you just stake the algorand that you do have, which is not difficult and anyone can do.

But knowing it's all being done, most likely, to maximize growth of the network is good, because that reflects in a price increase.  I'm welcome to hear other opinions on this.  I'm just reading and learning like everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Msc.**

As far as burned tokens that's 19.9m.  But that's a pretty small amount relative to the market cap, so I wouldn't worry about it.  Burning a token is when it's removed forever from supply.

Algorand would be much more unique if they would actually be permissionless and decentralized, but they simply aren't. Right now they are just the so-manieth permissioned blockchain.

I think it is no coincidence that so far Algorand has only attracted start ups, mostly by sponsoring them.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

Where did you find the information about 25M being released every two weeks? I did not notice that in the token dynamics even though I was already wondering about the graph being continuous and not a step function.  


About the 2.5B tokens for the foundation: Yeah I'm worried about that, too.  In the AMA video Steve Kokinos brushed this off pretty fast by pointing out that this makes the network more secure. Well, and centralized. For example comparing it to Cardano, the foundation holds a modest 5 / 45 B tokens. Algorand starting with a quarter of the whole assets raises an eyebrow.

This means 'node centralization' 'stakes centralization' doesn't happen. Network scales as nodes scale and adversary due to true randomness never know whom to target.

The entire community agrees on the next block and confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users.

[deleted],,,"I don't know when it will take off, but it seems like the price has establish a floor in the 0.20 to 0.28 range, and upper resistance at 0.34.

But in Bitcoin Bull-markets, which we are entering, alt-coins tend to grow faster than Bitcoin.  I think this is partly because coins with larger market caps grow slower than ones with smaller ones, so ALGO has a much higher ""potential"" growth over the next few years.

Algo seems highly undervalued, given it's smaller market cap, the quality of the team, it's low cost, low centralization, and high speed.  I think it's something that many people will find, once they feel confident enough with the crypto bull run to explore Alt coins again.

Especially when you compare Algo to other Alts, with less scalability, higher costs, more centralization, less qualified teams, or with known scammers (ex: Craig Wright lolz).

Another place I expect near term adoption is in enterprise level custodial solutions.  Large enterprises increasingly want to be able to hold crypto without the ""risk"" of storing their own keys.  This is to help diversify the risks of holding all fiats.  Some of those companies (and investors) will opt to have at least some of their crypto earning staking rewards.

Right now the number of coins with simple and easy enough staking rewards, that they can be implemented in third party enterprise custodial solutions is limited.  Like coin-base custody only offers staking for Tezos and Algorand.  Binance has staking for Algorand and Cosmos.

Given the low cost and ease of adoption for Algorand when it comes to staking (supporting the network and getting paid), as well as the financial incentive for banks that are now storing cryptocurrencies to not only store Algorand for customers, but promote customers purchasing it so both the bank and the customer can earn staking rewards... it's pretty obviously how things roll out from here.  It's one of the advantageous, Algorand has of having so many Game Theory Geniuses on their team.

&amp;#x200B;

But with price I expect some kind of roller coaster in price in the near term, and those who are going to jump off and hurt themselves when algo takes a little dip, they should probably get off right now for their own safety.  Up or Down... who knows where it will go in the short term.  But to me, big growth over the longer term seems almost inevitable.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group.

I could go on but I'm just going to refer to what the Algorand team themselves have said regarding how the Algorand Foundation plans to handle things. In short, they will manage it much-like a traditional company handles a stock. 

The Algorand Foundation plans a **slow and steady** rise and will **counterbalance volatility**. That's what true professionals do. This isn't the lottery.   


Please read the Algorand team's post from January about their tokenomics.   


&gt; In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivaled scalability. At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019. During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation. These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. As confirmed by the observation of market returns and volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.   
&gt;  
&gt;The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards. Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.   
&gt;  
&gt;Conditional Vesting   
&gt;  
&gt;The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report. The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.   
&gt;  
&gt;In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

&gt;If that is the case what is the risk of having an online account -vs- and offline account on a wallet connected to an active node? As Algo is proof of stake I can see why it is beneficial to have many active stakes so I'm a little surprised there seems to be no structural incentive to keep stakes online.

You can actually go online without the secret key on the participation node. Generate the participation key from another location, then move that key over to the participation node. That is more secure: if the participation node is compromised, they still don't have access to the secret key.

This is also a part of the reason that the Algorand Foundation has such a large initial stake that they do not circulate. Until more participants start joining the consensus, they provide some stability and protection against attacks while the chain is young.

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

\- Set a date/time event that everyone can agree to do something spectacular for the Algorand project that helps it get noticed.

\- Have volunteer Recruiters... People that go out to explain the benefits of investing into Algorand.

\- Talk about the project while in game chats or discuss at popular events and give them information that helps them find it.

\- Find out if the Algorand project team is okay with creating promotional items to help advertise (T-Shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, hats, pens, personal blogs that are searchable, etc)

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

While the TEAL scripts have limits, combined with ASA (custom tokens) and atomic transfers meets many use cases without requiring layer 2 smart contracts (which will be added in the future).

* Loan payments
* Limit orders
* Subscriptions
* Collateralized obligations/loans

""The TEAL bytecode plus the length of any Args must add up to less than 1000 bytes (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxSize). Each TEAL op has an associated cost estimate and the program cost estimate must total less than 20000 (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxCost). Most ops have an estimated cost of 1, but a few slow crypto ops are much higher.""

While the TEAL scripts have limits, combined with ASA (custom tokens) and atomic transfers meets many use cases without requiring layer 2 smart contracts (which will be added in the future).

* escrow accounts
* Loan payments
* Limit orders
* Subscriptions
* Collateralized obligations/loans

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

[deleted],,,"**The Supply Cap**

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

The supply is capped at 10 billion.  There will never be more than 10 billion algo and all 10 billion already exists.  It is given out over time or sold to incentivize things like network growth and people setting up nodes.

[https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter](https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter)

Out of the 10 billion, 803 million are currently circulating.

Most websites show the market cap (total value of all the coins) for Algorand at 247 million so they must be only calculating that market cap for the total coins in circulation.

Because at the current price of 0.298  per algo that's a **2.9 billion usd market cap** when we account for all 10 billion coins.  For comparison **Bitcoin's market cap is 266 billion** right now, when we account for all 21 million bitcoin's that will exist.

Ethereum doesn't even have a supply cap, so it'll just keep inflating forever making it's future market cap infinite.

So I don't think algorand's market cap is too high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Supply Rate**

But I imagine most people are concerned with the Supply rate.  Which is how fast are Algor and being given out (for things like staking) and put into circulation?

And the answer is, it appears to be that it's being managed by the team.

Here's a quote from the website:

*"" In the foreseeable future, it is our primary goal at the Foundation to increase the amount of rewards in line with the growth of the circulating supply corresponding to community feedback and market conditions. ""*

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

So it's kind of like how a central bank manages an economy, and they are adjusting rewards and things in real time to promote maximum growth.

Many crypto enthusiasts probably dislike this because it's people making decisions, and people can become corrupt or make bad decisions and they want everything coded in stone.

But I would argue that a bunch of game theoretic geniuses adjusting variables in real time with the financial goal of growing the value of Algorand (because that's how they can get rich also), is actually a good thing.

Take for example, staking rewards.  Algorand is the only cryptocurrency for which staking rewards are being offered by both coinbase custody and binance, so obviously these game theory guys are doing the right things to maximize adoption, especially considering there are plenty of cryptocurrencies that have been around longer and still haven't achieved that.

Those rewards should increase crypto bank adoption as well, banks make a percentage of that income.  All of this increases faster adoption and growth.

What these changing rates mean for the price, is that the price short term is less predictable because the inflation is less predictable so the rate of inflation's effect on the price is less predictable.  This risk can be greatly mitigated if you just stake the algorand that you do have, which is not difficult and anyone can do.

But knowing it's all being done, most likely, to maximize growth of the network is good, because that reflects in a price increase.  I'm welcome to hear other opinions on this.  I'm just reading and learning like everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Msc.**

As far as burned tokens that's 19.9m.  But that's a pretty small amount relative to the market cap, so I wouldn't worry about it.  Burning a token is when it's removed forever from supply.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

bigjohnston111,,,"You’re not entirely correct. There is more than meets the eye. The relay nodes are not decentralized. Reward earning relay nodes are whitelisted much like XRP. The project looks like XRP in some ways. Preferred nodes in XRP are run by trusted nodes and university. Algorand reward earning relay mode are run by trusted groups and universities. 

People will jump at saying the relay nodes are not a part of consensus however relay nodes are the backbone of Algorand and play an important part in consensus.

I would hope this doesn’t go the same way as XRP with the SEC but I’m left wondering why US persons were excluded from the super staking program.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

What Algorand really offers and why I see it growing is their Pure Proof of Stake which is their unique way of proving transactions.  The guy whos heading Algorand, Silvio Micali, is an incredibly smart MIT professor (although, in fairness all people heading cryptocurrency are incredibly smart) The crypto technology used makes it possible to make something like 1000 transactions per second which is a vast improvement on most platforms and reduces the viability of a few kinds of major attacks in the process.  

There is always the chance someone comes up with a better solution, but I see this growing personally.  I like the technology and think it is currently underappreciated and view computationally expensive transactions as the largest issue with crypto today.    This solves some of those issues, and while I'll still be watching the options while I hold I think that this is one of the better options out there.

While singing their praises it's worth recognizing that superior tech doesn't always win, and I can't really speak to how well they are marketing their solution.

The project looks like XRP in some ways. Preferred nodes in XRP are run by trusted nodes and university. Algorand reward earning relay mode are run by trusted groups and universities. 

People will jump at saying the relay nodes are not a part of consensus however relay nodes are the backbone of Algorand and play an important part in consensus.

Algorand is reporting a current annual yield of 7.07% at the time of this post: https://algoexplorer.io/rewards-calculator.  
  
Coinbase states: ""When you hold Algorand on Coinbase, you can earn rewards. 6.00% is the estimated annual rewards rate, which may change over time. It's based on the Algorand rewards generated by the protocol."" And the Coinbase fees page list's their Staking fee at 25%:

When Dan Larimer kicked Charles out of BitShares years ago, he said: ""Charles is a salesman that tells everyone what they want to hear and has no compulsion with stretching the truth to absurd lengths or telling outright lies.""

Charles is a very smart guy and Cardano will probably be a great coin, but he is also an over confident narcissist and there seems to be truth in that quote with regards to why there are so many missed deadlines, and why the Cardano ICO was in 2015 and it is still just a centralized token to this day. It took weeks before Charles addressed the missed ""Shelly in Q2"" deadline, and when he did address it, it was with a serious attitude and no mea culpa.

Cardano won't have a real mainnnet until Shelley is live and they will start with 100% permissioned nodes and work down to 0. Once Shelley is actually live, yeah Cardano should go higher.

Algorand also needs to open up it's node relays to not be permissioned, my guess is before Shelley is 0% permissioned.

Did you know Algorand's inventor Silvio Micali is co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs as well as the VRF central to the consensus of both Algorand and Cardano?

What are you excited about with Cardano, Shelley, Plutus, Marlowe, etc? Maybe even Atala? 

With Algorand, I'm excited about:

ReneRGN,,,"&gt;fully believe in the tech, but the way they created the foundation and are running it like a business is not really good for their public perception. Giving yourself 2.5B tokens to start with is very far from decentralized. It's just another business. I'm actually disappointed. But I'm still going to watch closely and buy some with small funds, I just don't see it going anywhere near the mo

Thanks for your insights! I like that spirit of people generally believing this is a great project. But yeah, it's dangerous if the auctions likely turn out harmful for early investors.  
Where did you find the information about 25M being released every two weeks? I did not notice that in the token dynamics even though I was already wondering about the graph being continuous and not a step function.  


About the 2.5B tokens for the foundation: Yeah I'm worried about that, too.  In the AMA video Steve Kokinos brushed this off pretty fast by pointing out that this makes the network more secure. Well, and centralized. For example comparing it to Cardano, the foundation holds a modest 5 / 45 B tokens. Algorand starting with a quarter of the whole assets raises an eyebrow. I don't think it's bad intention, but pretty bad practice.

dolle,,,"Thanks! Hmm, from skimming [the whitepaper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132757) it was not my impression that you would first have to stake your funds in order to participate. In particular, this quote (page 2) suggests that no setup which would reveal your intention to participate is necessary:

&gt;Finally, an adversary may target a committee member once that member sends a message in BA⋆.BA⋆mitigates this attack by requiring committee members to speak just once. Thus, once a committee member sends his message (exposing his identity to an adversary),the committee member becomes irrelevant to BA⋆

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

A Fundação Algorand tem o prazer de anunciar o lançamento do seu Programa Universitário Global. Com as principais universidades científicas da China, Europa, Oriente Médio, Canadá e Estados Unidos, as instituições de associação inaugural representam uma mistura diversificada de líderes influentes em ciência da computação e inovação em blockchain. Estabelecidos para oferecer uma oportunidade para alunos e professores ingressarem na comunidade Algorand, participarem da inovação disruptiva e contribuírem para a nova economia do conhecimento sem fronteiras, os membros fundadores compartilham a visão da Fundação Algorand sobre o potencial do blockchain como uma força para a justiça social e global. Boa.
Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

dolle,,,"Thanks! Hmm, from skimming [the whitepaper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132757) it was not my impression that you would first have to stake your funds in order to participate. In particular, this quote (page 2) suggests that no setup which would reveal your intention to participate is necessary:

&gt;Finally, an adversary may target a committee member once that member sends a message in BA⋆.BA⋆mitigates this attack by requiring committee members to speak just once. Thus, once a committee member sends his message (exposing his identity to an adversary),the committee member becomes irrelevant to BA⋆

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

(1) Keeping an Algorand node online exposes your funds to more risk because you need the private key to compute the VRF proof that you ""won the lottery"", hence the key must be kept in memory on a publicly exposed machine.

(2) The operational costs of keeping an Algorand node online are probably not comparable to BitTorrent.

JesterBombs,,,"I'm always fascinated by the amount of focus people have on market cap in the crypto space.  Market cap is more relevant to mergers and acquisitions, neither of which applies when someone buys the majority share of any given token.  If Amazon has a bad day Bezos could lose billions of dollars... IF he sells his holdings at those lower prices.  Any major transfer of shares is regulated by the SEC and the bottom line is that market cap applies in that regard.  If everyone dumped Amazon at the same time the price and market cap would temporarily suffer but the fundamentals of Amazon are intact and price will adjust accordingly.  In that respect the same is true here except we don't know what Algorand will be able to accomplish in the future which is grounds to justify the price (and panic selling from reading articles like that).  In summary, if Algorand keeps building their network, offers benefits that other cryptos do not and increases usage the price will adjust accordingly and for reasons we simply won't know for sure until it happens.

The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand. They hopefully won't make additional business mistakes and  I agree increasing the regular staking rewards that don't require KYC would be a great move, as well as burning tokens.",True,0,1568816493,,False,0,f0oogcs,t3_d4y9tz,t1_f0mlpaa,1577149598.0,2,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/d4y9tz/whatll_happen_to_algo_in_next_two_years/f0oogcs/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1497962268.0,t2_4ma6lzt,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,False,,,,,,

Perhaps Shelley would have been live last year if they didn't split up their resources? Keep in mind that once Shelley goes live it will take a while before it has 100% permissionless nodes.

Cardano ICO'd so far ahead of a working decentralized product (still not here yet 5 years later) which resulted in an underpriced ICO therefore IOHK  is under funded (relative to most coin devs) causing them to do Atala to try and earn cash and slow down Shelley as a result. 

Ultimately it's the tech that really matters and pricing will follow and the VRF that is central to Cardano and Algorand's consensus is co-invented by Silvio Micali, the founder of Algorand and also the co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs.

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens.

[deleted],,,"I don't know when it will take off, but it seems like the price has establish a floor in the 0.20 to 0.28 range, and upper resistance at 0.34.

But in Bitcoin Bull-markets, which we are entering, alt-coins tend to grow faster than Bitcoin.  I think this is partly because coins with larger market caps grow slower than ones with smaller ones, so ALGO has a much higher ""potential"" growth over the next few years.

Algo seems highly undervalued, given it's smaller market cap, the quality of the team, it's low cost, low centralization, and high speed.  I think it's something that many people will find, once they feel confident enough with the crypto bull run to explore Alt coins again.

Especially when you compare Algo to other Alts, with less scalability, higher costs, more centralization, less qualified teams, or with known scammers (ex: Craig Wright lolz).

Another place I expect near term adoption is in enterprise level custodial solutions.  Large enterprises increasingly want to be able to hold crypto without the ""risk"" of storing their own keys.  This is to help diversify the risks of holding all fiats.  Some of those companies (and investors) will opt to have at least some of their crypto earning staking rewards.

Right now the number of coins with simple and easy enough staking rewards, that they can be implemented in third party enterprise custodial solutions is limited.  Like coin-base custody only offers staking for Tezos and Algorand.  Binance has staking for Algorand and Cosmos.

Given the low cost and ease of adoption for Algorand when it comes to staking (supporting the network and getting paid), as well as the financial incentive for banks that are now storing cryptocurrencies to not only store Algorand for customers, but promote customers purchasing it so both the bank and the customer can earn staking rewards... it's pretty obviously how things roll out from here.  It's one of the advantageous, Algorand has of having so many Game Theory Geniuses on their team.

&amp;#x200B;

But with price I expect some kind of roller coaster in price in the near term, and those who are going to jump off and hurt themselves when algo takes a little dip, they should probably get off right now for their own safety.  Up or Down... who knows where it will go in the short term.  But to me, big growth over the longer term seems almost inevitable.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

That being said the $10 upper end  and frequent auctions are there to discourage whale accumulation. If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously. This was done to stop large BTC holders basically controlling the coin from day one as they do with most icos it's to encourage a more diverse spread in market and hopefully stop market manipulation.


As for the price the interesting thing I'm watching for is Facebook Libra announcement on the 18th one day before the algorand auction.

Facebook had meetings with algorand many times late last year and earlier this year. 


Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.

Every wallet automatically earns staking rewards as long as they have at least 1 Algo; you do not have to actively do anything to earn rewards.

If you do want to participate in the consensus-making protocol, you need to run a participation node, generate a limited-duration participation key, and then publish that key by ""going online"". Further information can be found on the [Algorand developer website](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/creating-new-account-and-participation-key).

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

Additionally, looking at Slack\[NYSE:WORK\] went IPO and the market cap as of now is $21 billion; I believe we are still in the stages of valuing the blockchain first companies and the token itself and Algorand's valuation between $3-7 billion at this stage does not surprise me.",True,0,1561142517,,False,0,erqg1pf,t3_c17szn,t1_erq79a1,1570476432.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c17szn/is_ada_going_to_win_against_algorand/erqg1pf/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1284768643.0,t2_4cqmz,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,
BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

I replied to someone earlier about pros and cons of the wallet as well with a couple other points, have a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/lf9pbp/just_got_into_algo/gml120k?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) if you want a little more info.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

Considering the vast majority of the legitimate science and research in this industry is open source, anyone can adopt any tech at any time.  What's going to be the difference maker is the relationships and that's where Cardano is overwhelmingly ahead. 

That said, anyone is free to adopt the technology Cardano has spent many millions of dollars to produce. The only problem is that in order to make a change, you would have to demonstrate that you better understand the tech in a way that your proposal is actually better than Cardano.  If not, then why not just use Cardano? Conversely if Algorand produces groundbreaking science, Cardano will adopt it if it improves the project.  IOHK would be relieved to have someone else do the heavy lifting for once, the science and research path is quite expensive.

Better tech can come along as it should, but a project that is structured in a way to be agile and adopt new ideas and approaches without having to hard fork is formidable long term.

CH is constantly criticized for traveling but he is obviously doing the hard work that will propel Cardano to the future despite any Libra or Amazon or Google ventures that come along.

Any major transfer of shares is regulated by the SEC and the bottom line is that market cap applies in that regard.  If everyone dumped Amazon at the same time the price and market cap would temporarily suffer but the fundamentals of Amazon are intact and price will adjust accordingly.  In that respect the same is true here except we don't know what Algorand will be able to accomplish in the future which is grounds to justify the price (and panic selling from reading articles like that).  In summary, if Algorand keeps building their network, offers benefits that other cryptos do not and increases usage the price will adjust accordingly and for reasons we simply won't know for sure until it happens.

That being said the $10 upper end  and frequent auctions are there to discourage whale accumulation. If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously. This was done to stop large BTC holders basically controlling the coin from day one as they do with most icos it's to encourage a more diverse spread in market and hopefully stop market manipulation.


As for the price the interesting thing I'm watching for is Facebook Libra announcement on the 18th one day before the algorand auction.

Facebook had meetings with algorand many times late last year and earlier this year. 


Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.

\- The individuals that sell off causing it to drop hard, while they could have just HELD much longer and earned a much higher profit

\- And the individuals that pump and dump, causing some people to lose, resulting in several people not wanting to ""invest"" into this great project/coin.

However, if one is wanting to get noticed, then one can take from the playbook from doge or the reddit groups itself or at least from the old gaming groups :

\- Set a date/time event that everyone can agree to do something spectacular for the Algorand project that helps it get noticed.

\- Have volunteer Recruiters... People that go out to explain the benefits of investing into Algorand.

\- Talk about the project while in game chats or discuss at popular events and give them information that helps them find it.

\- Find out if the Algorand project team is okay with creating promotional items to help advertise (T-Shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, hats, pens, personal blogs that are searchable, etc)

Ok_Negotiation_2974,,,"You raise a solid objection. I will do my best to respond because I understand your frustration. Algo truly brought proof-of-stake from a dream to a reality. 

I find node secrecy to be essential right now within our current framework - while that doesn’t sound like a good thing, I believe it is important. And this is where most people get confused with Bitcoin. (Stay with me for a minute) ... 

Bitcoin, is not private, rather it’s entirely traceable in every way. That’s the beauty of it. We all have access to the guts of the network. We can prop up many things to support its existence, but keeping your engagement with it will never be private. So this is where products like zCash are truly unique to the topic of privatization. 

I think you may be getting stuck on where Algo looks to tackle the topics of “permissionless” and “decentralization” and “democratization.” I believe Algo attempts to solve these issues in layer 1 related to their ‘rekeying’ principles which seeks to allow a user to change their private key but always retain their public address. This allows you and I to not have to change who we are on two-levels every time we send goofy tokens to each other.

Back to the nodes ... in principle, we hate and need nodes to be private in the Algo network because it secures the underlying strategy of Algo which is to keep transactions private. A permissionless network allows by its rules to allow anyone to join without friction, and validates transactions within its user base only. In order to do the same at the node level, node privacy is paramount in order to protect users at the transaction level. In essence, we are protected, private and decentralized at peer-to-peer transaction level through Algo’s rekeying stack ... and we are protected, private and decentralized at the node level too because by nature the nodes are validated by the pure fact that a transaction is validated rather than rejected.

This offers decentrality for the individual running the node and for the network of users. 

I’m not certain that democracy is the goal of a permissionless network, rather privacy is, nor is it the goal of algorand nor is democratization a requirement to claim ‘decentrality.’ For example, let’s say I purchase a chicken from you. I may want to know certain things about said chicken before the purchase, like, how big was the rooster that smashed the hen that laid the egg that became the chicken I’m going to buy .... if I purchase with say a token like VeChain, I’m going to be able to track just about everything that went into that chicken before I buy it and you are going to know who the person is that ends up with your chicken. But if I leverage Algo, our fiscal interaction is entirely private, the transaction authentication is entirely private and we trust this to be so because the network architecture is built to keep all layers not only private but autonomously operative and free from 3rd party eyes.

And this is exactly why Algo is beautiful. In a centralized fiscal policy we can trace all levels of interaction and you can show up at my door and ask for your chicken back. But you can also protect your chicken source or business practices and not have me show up at your door because I want to know where the chicken came from.

Trust is the core principle behind Algo. It is permissionless in that anyone can join and deploy, it is democratic in that the transaction is visible while the rekeying layer secures privacy, and it is decentralized in that the users and nodes confirm true interaction while not relying on third party authentication - its open, while closed framework makes this so.

Message me offline - I’m certain there is a way to deploy a node if you are interested but consider this ... if you had to be taught how to do it, by nature you would already lose a sliver of your privacy in order to be shown how to do it.

I think their claims remain true within their fiscal framework.

**TL;DR:**  
1) *True Decentralization solved* \-- How? The network is not controlled by a few miners or validator set since proposers and committees are randomly selected using Cryptographic sortition and VRF. This means 'node centralization' 'stakes centralization' doesn't happen. Network scales as nodes scale and adversary due to true randomness never know whom to target.  
2) *Scalability* \-- How? Algorand is scalable as nodes on network grow. Algorand gives instant finality (1-4 sec blocktime) unlike other non-final POS/ POW blockchains. The entire community agrees on the next block and confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users.  
3) *Security* \-- How? True randomness, no select group to target, no mining centralization, instant finality rending fork probability as zero. Secure against Static, Dynamic and Network adversaries.

dolle,,,"Thanks! Hmm, from skimming [the whitepaper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132757) it was not my impression that you would first have to stake your funds in order to participate. In particular, this quote (page 2) suggests that no setup which would reveal your intention to participate is necessary:

&gt;Finally, an adversary may target a committee member once that member sends a message in BA⋆.BA⋆mitigates this attack by requiring committee members to speak just once. Thus, once a committee member sends his message (exposing his identity to an adversary),the committee member becomes irrelevant to BA⋆

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

(1) Keeping an Algorand node online exposes your funds to more risk because you need the private key to compute the VRF proof that you ""won the lottery"", hence the key must be kept in memory on a publicly exposed machine.

(2) The operational costs of keeping an Algorand node online are probably not comparable to BitTorrent. If your Algorand node runs on a portable device, then it is much more costly (relatively) to keep it online at all times compared to a server in your basement.",True,0,1560969640,,False,0,erkr8vj,t3_c2i5tb,t1_erkai23,1570294305.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,True,/r/algorand/comments/c2i5tb/online_requirements/erkr8vj/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1194204242.0,t2_312ha,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

What Algorand really offers and why I see it growing is their Pure Proof of Stake which is their unique way of proving transactions.  The guy whos heading Algorand, Silvio Micali, is an incredibly smart MIT professor (although, in fairness all people heading cryptocurrency are incredibly smart) The crypto technology used makes it possible to make something like 1000 transactions per second which is a vast improvement on most platforms and reduces the viability of a few kinds of major attacks in the process.  

There is always the chance someone comes up with a better solution, but I see this growing personally.  I like the technology and think it is currently underappreciated and view computationally expensive transactions as the largest issue with crypto today.    This solves some of those issues, and while I'll still be watching the options while I hold I think that this is one of the better options out there.

While singing their praises it's worth recognizing that superior tech doesn't always win, and I can't really speak to how well they are marketing their solution.

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

Naki111,,,"You realise you can't lose 80% or 90% right the terms of the sale come with a guaranteed buyback of 90% the price in one year if the price is below so the most you can lose is 10%.


That being said the $10 upper end  and frequent auctions are there to discourage whale accumulation. If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously. This was done to stop large BTC holders basically controlling the coin from day one as they do with most icos it's to encourage a more diverse spread in market and hopefully stop market manipulation.


As for the price the interesting thing I'm watching for is Facebook Libra announcement on the 18th one day before the algorand auction.

Facebook had meetings with algorand many times late last year and earlier this year. 


Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.


That being said if it is a libra algorand partnership algorand would have more users from day one than the top 10 coins put together",True,0,1560687551,,False,0,erbn903,t3_c0m0j7,t3_c0m0j7,1570082725.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c0m0j7/algo_auction_borderlessly_overpriced/erbn903/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1512642831.0,t2_4erj7gw,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Jaysallday,,,"As someone who went through alt season in 2017-18, what we are currently seeing is much different. 

Last time complete speculation was what was driving the price on the majority of ICO's. Teams needed a white paper and an idea and fools were giving them ETH and BTC in exchange for future wishful promises. 

Now we see DeFi projects, and new innovative block chain platforms dominating the market cap charts. Many of these have actual value propositions behind them or actual working new technological advances over the current big dogs Eth and Btc. 

And we are seeing large institutions actually starting to massively invest in a few big coins. This is massive amounts of new money, much of which will likely trail down into the projects below which actually deserve it. 

All of this is to say, I do not think we are in a situation like 2018 again. Were at some point it will seem like a flip was switched and all interest has left and the price only goes down for years for nearly all projects.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

[deleted],,,"I don't know when it will take off, but it seems like the price has establish a floor in the 0.20 to 0.28 range, and upper resistance at 0.34.

But in Bitcoin Bull-markets, which we are entering, alt-coins tend to grow faster than Bitcoin.  I think this is partly because coins with larger market caps grow slower than ones with smaller ones, so ALGO has a much higher ""potential"" growth over the next few years.

Algo seems highly undervalued, given it's smaller market cap, the quality of the team, it's low cost, low centralization, and high speed.  I think it's something that many people will find, once they feel confident enough with the crypto bull run to explore Alt coins again.

Especially when you compare Algo to other Alts, with less scalability, higher costs, more centralization, less qualified teams, or with known scammers (ex: Craig Wright lolz).

Another place I expect near term adoption is in enterprise level custodial solutions.  Large enterprises increasingly want to be able to hold crypto without the ""risk"" of storing their own keys.  This is to help diversify the risks of holding all fiats.  Some of those companies (and investors) will opt to have at least some of their crypto earning staking rewards.

Right now the number of coins with simple and easy enough staking rewards, that they can be implemented in third party enterprise custodial solutions is limited.  Like coin-base custody only offers staking for Tezos and Algorand.  Binance has staking for Algorand and Cosmos.

Given the low cost and ease of adoption for Algorand when it comes to staking (supporting the network and getting paid), as well as the financial incentive for banks that are now storing cryptocurrencies to not only store Algorand for customers, but promote customers purchasing it so both the bank and the customer can earn staking rewards... it's pretty obviously how things roll out from here.  It's one of the advantageous, Algorand has of having so many Game Theory Geniuses on their team.

&amp;#x200B;

But with price I expect some kind of roller coaster in price in the near term, and those who are going to jump off and hurt themselves when algo takes a little dip, they should probably get off right now for their own safety.  Up or Down... who knows where it will go in the short term.  But to me, big growth over the longer term seems almost inevitable.

When the vesting acceleration started, 30 cents was the first level of the 1-month moving average making vesting accelerate, but after that vesting acceleration happened only at higher and higher levels of the moving average of the price. Vesting acceleration can have the effect of generating an outflow of Algos when the moving average reaches new highs, but also the opposite effect of encouraging Early Backers to hold further. The mechanism has no predictable price effect and is automatic and transparent.”

That is from the official website but doesn’t massively clear up the methodology for me... also interestingly I was under the impression that only 1-1.5bio had been put into circulation so far (coinbase data), but according to Algorand that figure is above 3.5bio of which (as you say) 2.3bio is currently being staked.

**TL;DR:**  
1) *True Decentralization solved* \-- How? The network is not controlled by a few miners or validator set since proposers and committees are randomly selected using Cryptographic sortition and VRF. This means 'node centralization' 'stakes centralization' doesn't happen. Network scales as nodes scale and adversary due to true randomness never know whom to target.  
2) *Scalability* \-- How? Algorand is scalable as nodes on network grow. Algorand gives instant finality (1-4 sec blocktime) unlike other non-final POS/ POW blockchains. The entire community agrees on the next block and confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users.  
3) *Security* \-- How? True randomness, no select group to target, no mining centralization, instant finality rending fork probability as zero. Secure against Static, Dynamic and Network adversaries.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

KieSciante,,,"Maybe not a 5-year-old, but I think [this](https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/algorand-and-the-solution-to-the-blockchain-trilemma-security-scalability-and-decentralization-5311) explains it pretty well.

**TL;DR:**  
1) *True Decentralization solved* \-- How? The network is not controlled by a few miners or validator set since proposers and committees are randomly selected using Cryptographic sortition and VRF. This means 'node centralization' 'stakes centralization' doesn't happen. Network scales as nodes scale and adversary due to true randomness never know whom to target.  
2) *Scalability* \-- How? Algorand is scalable as nodes on network grow. Algorand gives instant finality (1-4 sec blocktime) unlike other non-final POS/ POW blockchains.

Perhaps Shelley would have been live last year if they didn't split up their resources? Keep in mind that once Shelley goes live it will take a while before it has 100% permissionless nodes.

Cardano ICO'd so far ahead of a working decentralized product (still not here yet 5 years later) which resulted in an underpriced ICO therefore IOHK  is under funded (relative to most coin devs) causing them to do Atala to try and earn cash and slow down Shelley as a result. 

Ultimately it's the tech that really matters and pricing will follow and the VRF that is central to Cardano and Algorand's consensus is co-invented by Silvio Micali, the founder of Algorand and also the co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

ratsnake666,,,"To the extent that it's a different utilization of the same idea, yes.  To some extent it's competing with ETH, but different solutions can be utilized in different ways and I personally don't see them in direct competition.  

What Algorand really offers and why I see it growing is their Pure Proof of Stake which is their unique way of proving transactions.  The guy whos heading Algorand, Silvio Micali, is an incredibly smart MIT professor (although, in fairness all people heading cryptocurrency are incredibly smart) The crypto technology used makes it possible to make something like 1000 transactions per second which is a vast improvement on most platforms and reduces the viability of a few kinds of major attacks in the process.  

There is always the chance someone comes up with a better solution, but I see this growing personally.  I like the technology and think it is currently underappreciated and view computationally expensive transactions as the largest issue with crypto today.    This solves some of those issues, and while I'll still be watching the options while I hold I think that this is one of the better options out there.

While singing their praises it's worth recognizing that superior tech doesn't always win, and I can't really speak to how well they are marketing their solution.

The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed  to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential  was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking  rewards.

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In  order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a   diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,   and other research institutions volunteered to support the network   prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while   also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true   decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the   Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand   protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For  their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created  to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.   The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept  online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It   is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness   of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.   However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to   selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In  response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase  the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher  rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of  time.* 

*This   will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics  while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to  support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a  decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.   Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the  federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research  institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market  causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's  time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and  started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.   Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They  didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups  benefited from your hard earned cash.

In  response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a  means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by  ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the  select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part  of these groups.

I want to see better supply distribution and more transparency regarding num nodes and disbursement along with TPS and other metrics holding the waterline before I'm a buyer.  I'd also like to see more information about plans for integration of smart contracts, metadata and other second layer computational architecture.",True,0,1566239533,,False,0,exffpsy,t3_csffkr,t3_csffkr,1575111080.0,7,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/csffkr/why_is_the_price_dumping_even_after_being_listed/exffpsy/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Thanks for your insights! I like that spirit of people generally believing this is a great project. But yeah, it's dangerous if the auctions likely turn out harmful for early investors.  
Where did you find the information about 25M being released every two weeks? I did not notice that in the token dynamics even though I was already wondering about the graph being continuous and not a step function.  


About the 2.5B tokens for the foundation: Yeah I'm worried about that, too.  In the AMA video Steve Kokinos brushed this off pretty fast by pointing out that this makes the network more secure. Well, and centralized. For example comparing it to Cardano, the foundation holds a modest 5 / 45 B tokens. Algorand starting with a quarter of the whole assets raises an eyebrow. I don't think it's bad intention, but pretty bad practice.

Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

**TL;DR:**  
1) *True Decentralization solved* \-- How? The network is not controlled by a few miners or validator set since proposers and committees are randomly selected using Cryptographic sortition and VRF. This means 'node centralization' 'stakes centralization' doesn't happen. Network scales as nodes scale and adversary due to true randomness never know whom to target.  
2) *Scalability* \-- How? Algorand is scalable as nodes on network grow. Algorand gives instant finality (1-4 sec blocktime) unlike other non-final POS/ POW blockchains. The entire community agrees on the next block and confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users.  
3) *Security* \-- How? True randomness, no select group to target, no mining centralization, instant finality rending fork probability as zero. Secure against Static, Dynamic and Network adversaries.

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

The main being what people keep overlooking is the staking and participation rewards.


Between them they total 4.25 billion algos those rewards are distributed to holders for staking etc over 5 years at quite a decent rate the earlier in the more rewards received.


So first auction is 25 million plus you have algorands 2.5 billion which won't be sold but is used to secure the network as it gets distributed so you can't really count the 2.5 billion into circulation.

Every month roughly 50 million enters circulation more counting rewards etc but the rewards aren't sold there given to current holders for staking or participating network. 

So in 5 years 3 billion is sold but 4.2 billion is accumulated in staking rewards by holders so a token bought day 1 would give you I'd assume 2.5 tokens if held 5 years.

Market cap is more relevant to mergers and acquisitions, neither of which applies when someone buys the majority share of any given token.  If Amazon has a bad day Bezos could lose billions of dollars... IF he sells his holdings at those lower prices.  Any major transfer of shares is regulated by the SEC and the bottom line is that market cap applies in that regard.  If everyone dumped Amazon at the same time the price and market cap would temporarily suffer but the fundamentals of Amazon are intact and price will adjust accordingly.  In that respect the same is true here except we don't know what Algorand will be able to accomplish in the future which is grounds to justify the price (and panic selling from reading articles like that).  In summary, if Algorand keeps building their network, offers benefits that other cryptos do not and increases usage the price will adjust accordingly and for reasons we simply won't know for sure until it happens.

Ok_Negotiation_2974,,,"You raise a solid objection. I will do my best to respond because I understand your frustration. Algo truly brought proof-of-stake from a dream to a reality. 

I find node secrecy to be essential right now within our current framework - while that doesn’t sound like a good thing, I believe it is important. And this is where most people get confused with Bitcoin. (Stay with me for a minute) ... 

Bitcoin, is not private, rather it’s entirely traceable in every way. That’s the beauty of it. We all have access to the guts of the network. We can prop up many things to support its existence, but keeping your engagement with it will never be private. So this is where products like zCash are truly unique to the topic of privatization. 

I think you may be getting stuck on where Algo looks to tackle the topics of “permissionless” and “decentralization” and “democratization.” I believe Algo attempts to solve these issues in layer 1 related to their ‘rekeying’ principles which seeks to allow a user to change their private key but always retain their public address. This allows you and I to not have to change who we are on two-levels every time we send goofy tokens to each other.

Back to the nodes ... in principle, we hate and need nodes to be private in the Algo network because it secures the underlying strategy of Algo which is to keep transactions private. A permissionless network allows by its rules to allow anyone to join without friction, and validates transactions within its user base only. In order to do the same at the node level, node privacy is paramount in order to protect users at the transaction level. In essence, we are protected, private and decentralized at peer-to-peer transaction level through Algo’s rekeying stack ... and we are protected, private and decentralized at the node level too because by nature the nodes are validated by the pure fact that a transaction is validated rather than rejected.

This offers decentrality for the individual running the node and for the network of users. 

I’m not certain that democracy is the goal of a permissionless network, rather privacy is, nor is it the goal of algorand nor is democratization a requirement to claim ‘decentrality.’ For example, let’s say I purchase a chicken from you. I may want to know certain things about said chicken before the purchase, like, how big was the rooster that smashed the hen that laid the egg that became the chicken I’m going to buy .... if I purchase with say a token like VeChain, I’m going to be able to track just about everything that went into that chicken before I buy it and you are going to know who the person is that ends up with your chicken. But if I leverage Algo, our fiscal interaction is entirely private, the transaction authentication is entirely private and we trust this to be so because the network architecture is built to keep all layers not only private but autonomously operative and free from 3rd party eyes.

And this is exactly why Algo is beautiful. In a centralized fiscal policy we can trace all levels of interaction and you can show up at my door and ask for your chicken back. But you can also protect your chicken source or business practices and not have me show up at your door because I want to know where the chicken came from.

Trust is the core principle behind Algo. It is permissionless in that anyone can join and deploy, it is democratic in that the transaction is visible while the rekeying layer secures privacy, and it is decentralized in that the users and nodes confirm true interaction while not relying on third party authentication - its open, while closed framework makes this so.

Message me offline - I’m certain there is a way to deploy a node if you are interested but consider this ... if you had to be taught how to do it, by nature you would already lose a sliver of your privacy in order to be shown how to do it.

I think their claims remain true within their fiscal framework. And I don’t believe Algo is intending to be ‘democratic’ in the same way that other chains are attempting to do.",True,0,1610064336,,False,0,gihh553,t3_ksasco,t1_gih9czv,1620662796.0,0,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/ksasco/serious_lack_of_transparency/gihh553/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,,t2_8yz3d7d1,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,,,[],,,False,[],,,,,
_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

rjmcoin,,,"Cardano is a force in the entire industry.

Considering the vast majority of the legitimate science and research in this industry is open source, anyone can adopt any tech at any time.  What's going to be the difference maker is the relationships and that's where Cardano is overwhelmingly ahead. 

That said, anyone is free to adopt the technology Cardano has spent many millions of dollars to produce. The only problem is that in order to make a change, you would have to demonstrate that you better understand the tech in a way that your proposal is actually better than Cardano.  If not, then why not just use Cardano? Conversely if Algorand produces groundbreaking science, Cardano will adopt it if it improves the project.  IOHK would be relieved to have someone else do the heavy lifting for once, the science and research path is quite expensive.

Better tech can come along as it should, but a project that is structured in a way to be agile and adopt new ideas and approaches without having to hard fork is formidable long term.

CH is constantly criticized for traveling but he is obviously doing the hard work that will propel Cardano to the future despite any Libra or Amazon or Google ventures that come along. They will instead only propel Cardano's efforts.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

\- The individuals that sell off causing it to drop hard, while they could have just HELD much longer and earned a much higher profit

\- And the individuals that pump and dump, causing some people to lose, resulting in several people not wanting to ""invest"" into this great project/coin.

However, if one is wanting to get noticed, then one can take from the playbook from doge or the reddit groups itself or at least from the old gaming groups :

\- Set a date/time event that everyone can agree to do something spectacular for the Algorand project that helps it get noticed.

\- Have volunteer Recruiters... People that go out to explain the benefits of investing into Algorand.

\- Talk about the project while in game chats or discuss at popular events and give them information that helps them find it.

\- Find out if the Algorand project team is okay with creating promotional items to help advertise (T-Shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, hats, pens, personal blogs that are searchable, etc)

The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand. They hopefully won't make additional business mistakes and  I agree increasing the regular staking rewards that don't require KYC would be a great move, as well as burning tokens.",True,0,1568816493,,False,0,f0oogcs,t3_d4y9tz,t1_f0mlpaa,1577149598.0,2,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/d4y9tz/whatll_happen_to_algo_in_next_two_years/f0oogcs/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1497962268.0,t2_4ma6lzt,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,False,,,,,,

samlapoint,,," It's certainly possible that ALGO reaches several dollars in the near future but the second part of your prediction is just silly. Honestly, it's a red flag that reveals that you're new to the space and have a lot to learn. You also need to realize that even if there was a global economic collapse and people rushed into cryptocurrencies out of fear, they would be rushing into state backed CBDC's, stable-coins, and-or Bitcoin, not ALGO. I hope you understand that economies can't function properly with insane volatility.   


I could go on but I'm just going to refer to what the Algorand team themselves have said regarding how the Algorand Foundation plans to handle things. In short, they will manage it much-like a traditional company handles a stock. 

The Algorand Foundation plans a **slow and steady** rise and will **counterbalance volatility**. That's what true professionals do. This isn't the lottery.   


Please read the Algorand team's post from January about their tokenomics.   


&gt; In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivaled scalability. At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019. During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation. These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. As confirmed by the observation of market returns and volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.   
&gt;  
&gt;The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards. Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.   
&gt;  
&gt;Conditional Vesting   
&gt;  
&gt;The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report. The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.   
&gt;  
&gt;In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

The main being what people keep overlooking is the staking and participation rewards.


Between them they total 4.25 billion algos those rewards are distributed to holders for staking etc over 5 years at quite a decent rate the earlier in the more rewards received.


So first auction is 25 million plus you have algorands 2.5 billion which won't be sold but is used to secure the network as it gets distributed so you can't really count the 2.5 billion into circulation.

Every month roughly 50 million enters circulation more counting rewards etc but the rewards aren't sold there given to current holders for staking or participating network. 

So in 5 years 3 billion is sold but 4.2 billion is accumulated in staking rewards by holders so a token bought day 1 would give you I'd assume 2.5 tokens if held 5 years.

Ok_Negotiation_2974,,,"You raise a solid objection. I will do my best to respond because I understand your frustration. Algo truly brought proof-of-stake from a dream to a reality. 

I find node secrecy to be essential right now within our current framework - while that doesn’t sound like a good thing, I believe it is important. And this is where most people get confused with Bitcoin. (Stay with me for a minute) ... 

Bitcoin, is not private, rather it’s entirely traceable in every way. That’s the beauty of it. We all have access to the guts of the network. We can prop up many things to support its existence, but keeping your engagement with it will never be private. So this is where products like zCash are truly unique to the topic of privatization. 

I think you may be getting stuck on where Algo looks to tackle the topics of “permissionless” and “decentralization” and “democratization.” I believe Algo attempts to solve these issues in layer 1 related to their ‘rekeying’ principles which seeks to allow a user to change their private key but always retain their public address. This allows you and I to not have to change who we are on two-levels every time we send goofy tokens to each other.

Back to the nodes ... in principle, we hate and need nodes to be private in the Algo network because it secures the underlying strategy of Algo which is to keep transactions private. A permissionless network allows by its rules to allow anyone to join without friction, and validates transactions within its user base only. In order to do the same at the node level, node privacy is paramount in order to protect users at the transaction level. In essence, we are protected, private and decentralized at peer-to-peer transaction level through Algo’s rekeying stack ... and we are protected, private and decentralized at the node level too because by nature the nodes are validated by the pure fact that a transaction is validated rather than rejected.

This offers decentrality for the individual running the node and for the network of users. 

I’m not certain that democracy is the goal of a permissionless network, rather privacy is, nor is it the goal of algorand nor is democratization a requirement to claim ‘decentrality.’ For example, let’s say I purchase a chicken from you. I may want to know certain things about said chicken before the purchase, like, how big was the rooster that smashed the hen that laid the egg that became the chicken I’m going to buy .... if I purchase with say a token like VeChain, I’m going to be able to track just about everything that went into that chicken before I buy it and you are going to know who the person is that ends up with your chicken. But if I leverage Algo, our fiscal interaction is entirely private, the transaction authentication is entirely private and we trust this to be so because the network architecture is built to keep all layers not only private but autonomously operative and free from 3rd party eyes.

And this is exactly why Algo is beautiful. In a centralized fiscal policy we can trace all levels of interaction and you can show up at my door and ask for your chicken back. But you can also protect your chicken source or business practices and not have me show up at your door because I want to know where the chicken came from.

Trust is the core principle behind Algo. It is permissionless in that anyone can join and deploy, it is democratic in that the transaction is visible while the rekeying layer secures privacy, and it is decentralized in that the users and nodes confirm true interaction while not relying on third party authentication - its open, while closed framework makes this so.

Message me offline - I’m certain there is a way to deploy a node if you are interested but consider this ... if you had to be taught how to do it, by nature you would already lose a sliver of your privacy in order to be shown how to do it.

I think their claims remain true within their fiscal framework.

Every wallet automatically earns staking rewards as long as they have at least 1 Algo; you do not have to actively do anything to earn rewards.

If you do want to participate in the consensus-making protocol, you need to run a participation node, generate a limited-duration participation key, and then publish that key by ""going online"". Further information can be found on the [Algorand developer website](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/creating-new-account-and-participation-key).

samlapoint,,,"Here's a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/SamRLaPoint/status/1231477892573429760) of mine from February talking about buying into ALGO before it starts trending and pumping. Saw this coming quite some time ago. Only mentioning that so you know I've been accurate.

Also, an analyst recently [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1295457293283266560) a short-term ALGO chart that I completely agree with.

As for predictions, I think ALGO could reach $1.50-$2 by the end of the year as long as things continue in this direction. If it gains enough momentum, it could go significantly higher. Just depends on whether or not it gets caught up in the hype cycle. Either way, I plan on holding for some time.

As for people claiming ALGO can't hit a certain price, please read the Algorand team's post on their **revised** tokenomics / market conditions from . . . January.

Naki111,,,"I'm assuming 1 to 2 dollars for a few reasons.


The main being what people keep overlooking is the staking and participation rewards.


Between them they total 4.25 billion algos those rewards are distributed to holders for staking etc over 5 years at quite a decent rate the earlier in the more rewards received.


So first auction is 25 million plus you have algorands 2.5 billion which won't be sold but is used to secure the network as it gets distributed so you can't really count the 2.5 billion into circulation.

Every month roughly 50 million enters circulation more counting rewards etc but the rewards aren't sold there given to current holders for staking or participating network. 

So in 5 years 3 billion is sold but 4.2 billion is accumulated in staking rewards by holders so a token bought day 1 would give you I'd assume 2.5 tokens if held 5 years.

ratsnake666,,,"To the extent that it's a different utilization of the same idea, yes.  To some extent it's competing with ETH, but different solutions can be utilized in different ways and I personally don't see them in direct competition.  

What Algorand really offers and why I see it growing is their Pure Proof of Stake which is their unique way of proving transactions.  The guy whos heading Algorand, Silvio Micali, is an incredibly smart MIT professor (although, in fairness all people heading cryptocurrency are incredibly smart) The crypto technology used makes it possible to make something like 1000 transactions per second which is a vast improvement on most platforms and reduces the viability of a few kinds of major attacks in the process.  

There is always the chance someone comes up with a better solution, but I see this growing personally.  I like the technology and think it is currently underappreciated and view computationally expensive transactions as the largest issue with crypto today.    This solves some of those issues, and while I'll still be watching the options while I hold I think that this is one of the better options out there.

While singing their praises it's worth recognizing that superior tech doesn't always win, and I can't really speak to how well they are marketing their solution.

ReneRGN,,,"&gt;fully believe in the tech, but the way they created the foundation and are running it like a business is not really good for their public perception. Giving yourself 2.5B tokens to start with is very far from decentralized. It's just another business. I'm actually disappointed. But I'm still going to watch closely and buy some with small funds, I just don't see it going anywhere near the mo

Thanks for your insights! I like that spirit of people generally believing this is a great project. But yeah, it's dangerous if the auctions likely turn out harmful for early investors.  
Where did you find the information about 25M being released every two weeks? I did not notice that in the token dynamics even though I was already wondering about the graph being continuous and not a step function.  


About the 2.5B tokens for the foundation: Yeah I'm worried about that, too.  In the AMA video Steve Kokinos brushed this off pretty fast by pointing out that this makes the network more secure. Well, and centralized. For example comparing it to Cardano, the foundation holds a modest 5 / 45 B tokens. Algorand starting with a quarter of the whole assets raises an eyebrow. I don't think it's bad intention, but pretty bad practice.

In general that helps to understand certain things better, but this isn’t a valid attack (at least under the conditions you mention). The simple fact that you pay more than one dollar per click on google advertisement should show that a bribe of 7 cent will never work (otherwise all advertisement companies do something completely wrong).  In general I think in reality bribes work best if you only have to bribe a small group (in the best case only a centralized authority). In a proof of stake system the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) might be your friend and I think this is the biggest issue of all crypto currencies right now (see centralization of mining pools, validators, etc.). For cosmos I even showed that they currently actively incentivise a validator centralization ([https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-validator-centralization-block-proposer-reward/2633](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-validator-centralization-block-proposer-reward/2633)).

In Algorand's official wallet you must have at least 1 Algo and rewards accrued are added to your balance everytime you send yourself 0 Algo or receive any amount from anywhere else.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

Edit: They are changing their native token from ERD to eGLD (Elrond Gold) but it's not backed by Gold.

Cardano has missed deadlines so many times and this is reflected in the price. When asked about the big end of August announcement that didn't happen, Charles replied ""FU you piece of..."".

When Dan Larimer kicked Charles out of BitShares years ago, he said: ""Charles is a salesman that tells everyone what they want to hear and has no compulsion with stretching the truth to absurd lengths or telling outright lies.""

Charles is a very smart guy and Cardano will probably be a great coin, but he is also an over confident narcissist and there seems to be truth in that quote with regards to why there are so many missed deadlines, and why the Cardano ICO was in 2015 and it is still just a centralized token to this day. It took weeks before Charles addressed the missed ""Shelly in Q2"" deadline, and when he did address it, it was with a serious attitude and no mea culpa.

Cardano won't have a real mainnnet until Shelley is live and they will start with 100% permissioned nodes and work down to 0. Once Shelley is actually live, yeah Cardano should go higher.

Algorand also needs to open up it's node relays to not be permissioned, my guess is before Shelley is 0% permissioned.

Did you know Algorand's inventor Silvio Micali is co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs as well as the VRF central to the consensus of both Algorand and Cardano?

Why is price falling with the Coinbase listing?  Well the  Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were  constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy  just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different  now.

Furthermore, their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed  to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential  was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking  rewards.

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In  order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a   diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,   and other research institutions volunteered to support the network   prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while   also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true   decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the   Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand   protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For  their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created  to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.   The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept  online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It   is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness   of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.   However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to   selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In  response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase  the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher  rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of  time.* 

*This   will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics  while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to  support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a  decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.   Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the  federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research  institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market  causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's  time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and  started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.   Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They  didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups  benefited from your hard earned cash.

In  response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a  means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by  ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the  select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part  of these groups.

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

The main being what people keep overlooking is the staking and participation rewards.


Between them they total 4.25 billion algos those rewards are distributed to holders for staking etc over 5 years at quite a decent rate the earlier in the more rewards received.


So first auction is 25 million plus you have algorands 2.5 billion which won't be sold but is used to secure the network as it gets distributed so you can't really count the 2.5 billion into circulation.

Every month roughly 50 million enters circulation more counting rewards etc but the rewards aren't sold there given to current holders for staking or participating network. 

So in 5 years 3 billion is sold but 4.2 billion is accumulated in staking rewards by holders so a token bought day 1 would give you I'd assume 2.5 tokens if held 5 years.

[deleted],,,"**The Supply Cap**

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

The supply is capped at 10 billion.  There will never be more than 10 billion algo and all 10 billion already exists.  It is given out over time or sold to incentivize things like network growth and people setting up nodes.

[https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter](https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter)

Out of the 10 billion, 803 million are currently circulating.

Most websites show the market cap (total value of all the coins) for Algorand at 247 million so they must be only calculating that market cap for the total coins in circulation.

Because at the current price of 0.298  per algo that's a **2.9 billion usd market cap** when we account for all 10 billion coins.  For comparison **Bitcoin's market cap is 266 billion** right now, when we account for all 21 million bitcoin's that will exist.

Ethereum doesn't even have a supply cap, so it'll just keep inflating forever making it's future market cap infinite.

So I don't think algorand's market cap is too high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Supply Rate**

But I imagine most people are concerned with the Supply rate.  Which is how fast are Algor and being given out (for things like staking) and put into circulation?

And the answer is, it appears to be that it's being managed by the team.

Here's a quote from the website:

*"" In the foreseeable future, it is our primary goal at the Foundation to increase the amount of rewards in line with the growth of the circulating supply corresponding to community feedback and market conditions. ""*

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

So it's kind of like how a central bank manages an economy, and they are adjusting rewards and things in real time to promote maximum growth.

Many crypto enthusiasts probably dislike this because it's people making decisions, and people can become corrupt or make bad decisions and they want everything coded in stone.

But I would argue that a bunch of game theoretic geniuses adjusting variables in real time with the financial goal of growing the value of Algorand (because that's how they can get rich also), is actually a good thing.

Take for example, staking rewards.  Algorand is the only cryptocurrency for which staking rewards are being offered by both coinbase custody and binance, so obviously these game theory guys are doing the right things to maximize adoption, especially considering there are plenty of cryptocurrencies that have been around longer and still haven't achieved that.

Those rewards should increase crypto bank adoption as well, banks make a percentage of that income.  All of this increases faster adoption and growth.

What these changing rates mean for the price, is that the price short term is less predictable because the inflation is less predictable so the rate of inflation's effect on the price is less predictable.  This risk can be greatly mitigated if you just stake the algorand that you do have, which is not difficult and anyone can do.

But knowing it's all being done, most likely, to maximize growth of the network is good, because that reflects in a price increase.  I'm welcome to hear other opinions on this.  I'm just reading and learning like everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Msc.**

As far as burned tokens that's 19.9m.  But that's a pretty small amount relative to the market cap, so I wouldn't worry about it.  Burning a token is when it's removed forever from supply.

There is alot of info at the main algorand page on how to use the wallet. But some additional tips I do not see mentioned enough is always do a test transaction first when transferring large amounts, and always verify the beginning and end of wallet addresses you are sending to before hitting send.

Send a single coin or even fraction of a coin first, make sure it works and then send the rest.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

In particular, this quote (page 2) suggests that no setup which would reveal your intention to participate is necessary:

&gt;Finally, an adversary may target a committee member once that member sends a message in BA⋆.BA⋆mitigates this attack by requiring committee members to speak just once. Thus, once a committee member sends his message (exposing his identity to an adversary),the committee member becomes irrelevant to BA⋆

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

(1) Keeping an Algorand node online exposes your funds to more risk because you need the private key to compute the VRF proof that you ""won the lottery"", hence the key must be kept in memory on a publicly exposed machine.

(2) The operational costs of keeping an Algorand node online are probably not comparable to BitTorrent.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group.

Ok_Negotiation_2974,,,"You raise a solid objection. I will do my best to respond because I understand your frustration. Algo truly brought proof-of-stake from a dream to a reality. 

I find node secrecy to be essential right now within our current framework - while that doesn’t sound like a good thing, I believe it is important. And this is where most people get confused with Bitcoin. (Stay with me for a minute) ... 

Bitcoin, is not private, rather it’s entirely traceable in every way. That’s the beauty of it. We all have access to the guts of the network. We can prop up many things to support its existence, but keeping your engagement with it will never be private. So this is where products like zCash are truly unique to the topic of privatization. 

I think you may be getting stuck on where Algo looks to tackle the topics of “permissionless” and “decentralization” and “democratization.” I believe Algo attempts to solve these issues in layer 1 related to their ‘rekeying’ principles which seeks to allow a user to change their private key but always retain their public address. This allows you and I to not have to change who we are on two-levels every time we send goofy tokens to each other.

Back to the nodes ... in principle, we hate and need nodes to be private in the Algo network because it secures the underlying strategy of Algo which is to keep transactions private. A permissionless network allows by its rules to allow anyone to join without friction, and validates transactions within its user base only. In order to do the same at the node level, node privacy is paramount in order to protect users at the transaction level. In essence, we are protected, private and decentralized at peer-to-peer transaction level through Algo’s rekeying stack ... and we are protected, private and decentralized at the node level too because by nature the nodes are validated by the pure fact that a transaction is validated rather than rejected.

This offers decentrality for the individual running the node and for the network of users. 

I’m not certain that democracy is the goal of a permissionless network, rather privacy is, nor is it the goal of algorand nor is democratization a requirement to claim ‘decentrality.’ For example, let’s say I purchase a chicken from you. I may want to know certain things about said chicken before the purchase, like, how big was the rooster that smashed the hen that laid the egg that became the chicken I’m going to buy .... if I purchase with say a token like VeChain, I’m going to be able to track just about everything that went into that chicken before I buy it and you are going to know who the person is that ends up with your chicken. But if I leverage Algo, our fiscal interaction is entirely private, the transaction authentication is entirely private and we trust this to be so because the network architecture is built to keep all layers not only private but autonomously operative and free from 3rd party eyes.

And this is exactly why Algo is beautiful. In a centralized fiscal policy we can trace all levels of interaction and you can show up at my door and ask for your chicken back. But you can also protect your chicken source or business practices and not have me show up at your door because I want to know where the chicken came from.

Trust is the core principle behind Algo. It is permissionless in that anyone can join and deploy, it is democratic in that the transaction is visible while the rekeying layer secures privacy, and it is decentralized in that the users and nodes confirm true interaction while not relying on third party authentication - its open, while closed framework makes this so.

Message me offline - I’m certain there is a way to deploy a node if you are interested but consider this ... if you had to be taught how to do it, by nature you would already lose a sliver of your privacy in order to be shown how to do it.

I think their claims remain true within their fiscal framework.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

It's a bit embarrassing how ham-handed they handled the ICO.  You can pick either gross incompetence on the part of the economic architects or you can pick the project operating as a borderline scam.

That being said the $10 upper end  and frequent auctions are there to discourage whale accumulation. If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously. This was done to stop large BTC holders basically controlling the coin from day one as they do with most icos it's to encourage a more diverse spread in market and hopefully stop market manipulation.


As for the price the interesting thing I'm watching for is Facebook Libra announcement on the 18th one day before the algorand auction.

Facebook had meetings with algorand many times late last year and earlier this year. 


Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.

There was one auction at $2.50 then the price crashed from node relays selling their rewards so auctions have been paused for now and will resume at some point. Also node relay rewards have been greatly reduced by spreading out over more years and a bottom in pricing seems to have formed.

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

Additionally, looking at Slack\[NYSE:WORK\] went IPO and the market cap as of now is $21 billion; I believe we are still in the stages of valuing the blockchain first companies and the token itself and Algorand's valuation between $3-7 billion at this stage does not surprise me.",True,0,1561142517,,False,0,erqg1pf,t3_c17szn,t1_erq79a1,1570476432.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c17szn/is_ada_going_to_win_against_algorand/erqg1pf/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1284768643.0,t2_4cqmz,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

\- The individuals that sell off causing it to drop hard, while they could have just HELD much longer and earned a much higher profit

\- And the individuals that pump and dump, causing some people to lose, resulting in several people not wanting to ""invest"" into this great project/coin.

However, if one is wanting to get noticed, then one can take from the playbook from doge or the reddit groups itself or at least from the old gaming groups :

\- Set a date/time event that everyone can agree to do something spectacular for the Algorand project that helps it get noticed.

\- Have volunteer Recruiters... People that go out to explain the benefits of investing into Algorand.

\- Talk about the project while in game chats or discuss at popular events and give them information that helps them find it.

\- Find out if the Algorand project team is okay with creating promotional items to help advertise (T-Shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, hats, pens, personal blogs that are searchable, etc)

Considering the vast majority of the legitimate science and research in this industry is open source, anyone can adopt any tech at any time.  What's going to be the difference maker is the relationships and that's where Cardano is overwhelmingly ahead. 

That said, anyone is free to adopt the technology Cardano has spent many millions of dollars to produce. The only problem is that in order to make a change, you would have to demonstrate that you better understand the tech in a way that your proposal is actually better than Cardano.  If not, then why not just use Cardano? Conversely if Algorand produces groundbreaking science, Cardano will adopt it if it improves the project.  IOHK would be relieved to have someone else do the heavy lifting for once, the science and research path is quite expensive.

Better tech can come along as it should, but a project that is structured in a way to be agile and adopt new ideas and approaches without having to hard fork is formidable long term.

CH is constantly criticized for traveling but he is obviously doing the hard work that will propel Cardano to the future despite any Libra or Amazon or Google ventures that come along.

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

Additionally, looking at Slack\[NYSE:WORK\] went IPO and the market cap as of now is $21 billion; I believe we are still in the stages of valuing the blockchain first companies and the token itself and Algorand's valuation between $3-7 billion at this stage does not surprise me.",True,0,1561142517,,False,0,erqg1pf,t3_c17szn,t1_erq79a1,1570476432.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c17szn/is_ada_going_to_win_against_algorand/erqg1pf/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1284768643.0,t2_4cqmz,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Naki111,,,"You realise you can't lose 80% or 90% right the terms of the sale come with a guaranteed buyback of 90% the price in one year if the price is below so the most you can lose is 10%.


That being said the $10 upper end  and frequent auctions are there to discourage whale accumulation. If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously. This was done to stop large BTC holders basically controlling the coin from day one as they do with most icos it's to encourage a more diverse spread in market and hopefully stop market manipulation.


As for the price the interesting thing I'm watching for is Facebook Libra announcement on the 18th one day before the algorand auction.

Facebook had meetings with algorand many times late last year and earlier this year. 


Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

(1) Keeping an Algorand node online exposes your funds to more risk because you need the private key to compute the VRF proof that you ""won the lottery"", hence the key must be kept in memory on a publicly exposed machine.

(2) The operational costs of keeping an Algorand node online are probably not comparable to BitTorrent.

[deleted],,,"I don't know when it will take off, but it seems like the price has establish a floor in the 0.20 to 0.28 range, and upper resistance at 0.34.

But in Bitcoin Bull-markets, which we are entering, alt-coins tend to grow faster than Bitcoin.  I think this is partly because coins with larger market caps grow slower than ones with smaller ones, so ALGO has a much higher ""potential"" growth over the next few years.

Algo seems highly undervalued, given it's smaller market cap, the quality of the team, it's low cost, low centralization, and high speed.  I think it's something that many people will find, once they feel confident enough with the crypto bull run to explore Alt coins again.

Especially when you compare Algo to other Alts, with less scalability, higher costs, more centralization, less qualified teams, or with known scammers (ex: Craig Wright lolz).

Another place I expect near term adoption is in enterprise level custodial solutions.  Large enterprises increasingly want to be able to hold crypto without the ""risk"" of storing their own keys.  This is to help diversify the risks of holding all fiats.  Some of those companies (and investors) will opt to have at least some of their crypto earning staking rewards.

Right now the number of coins with simple and easy enough staking rewards, that they can be implemented in third party enterprise custodial solutions is limited.  Like coin-base custody only offers staking for Tezos and Algorand.  Binance has staking for Algorand and Cosmos.

Given the low cost and ease of adoption for Algorand when it comes to staking (supporting the network and getting paid), as well as the financial incentive for banks that are now storing cryptocurrencies to not only store Algorand for customers, but promote customers purchasing it so both the bank and the customer can earn staking rewards... it's pretty obviously how things roll out from here.  It's one of the advantageous, Algorand has of having so many Game Theory Geniuses on their team.

&amp;#x200B;

But with price I expect some kind of roller coaster in price in the near term, and those who are going to jump off and hurt themselves when algo takes a little dip, they should probably get off right now for their own safety.  Up or Down... who knows where it will go in the short term.  But to me, big growth over the longer term seems almost inevitable.

A Fundação Algorand tem o prazer de anunciar o lançamento do seu Programa Universitário Global. Com as principais universidades científicas da China, Europa, Oriente Médio, Canadá e Estados Unidos, as instituições de associação inaugural representam uma mistura diversificada de líderes influentes em ciência da computação e inovação em blockchain. Estabelecidos para oferecer uma oportunidade para alunos e professores ingressarem na comunidade Algorand, participarem da inovação disruptiva e contribuírem para a nova economia do conhecimento sem fronteiras, os membros fundadores compartilham a visão da Fundação Algorand sobre o potencial do blockchain como uma força para a justiça social e global. Boa.
Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

It's a bit embarrassing how ham-handed they handled the ICO.  You can pick either gross incompetence on the part of the economic architects or you can pick the project operating as a borderline scam.

ratsnake666,,,"To the extent that it's a different utilization of the same idea, yes.  To some extent it's competing with ETH, but different solutions can be utilized in different ways and I personally don't see them in direct competition.  

What Algorand really offers and why I see it growing is their Pure Proof of Stake which is their unique way of proving transactions.  The guy whos heading Algorand, Silvio Micali, is an incredibly smart MIT professor (although, in fairness all people heading cryptocurrency are incredibly smart) The crypto technology used makes it possible to make something like 1000 transactions per second which is a vast improvement on most platforms and reduces the viability of a few kinds of major attacks in the process.  

There is always the chance someone comes up with a better solution, but I see this growing personally.  I like the technology and think it is currently underappreciated and view computationally expensive transactions as the largest issue with crypto today.    This solves some of those issues, and while I'll still be watching the options while I hold I think that this is one of the better options out there.

While singing their praises it's worth recognizing that superior tech doesn't always win, and I can't really speak to how well they are marketing their solution.

Every wallet automatically earns staking rewards as long as they have at least 1 Algo; you do not have to actively do anything to earn rewards.

If you do want to participate in the consensus-making protocol, you need to run a participation node, generate a limited-duration participation key, and then publish that key by ""going online"". Further information can be found on the [Algorand developer website](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/creating-new-account-and-participation-key).

""The TEAL bytecode plus the length of any Args must add up to less than 1000 bytes (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxSize). Each TEAL op has an associated cost estimate and the program cost estimate must total less than 20000 (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxCost). Most ops have an estimated cost of 1, but a few slow crypto ops are much higher.""

While the TEAL scripts have limits, combined with ASA (custom tokens) and atomic transfers meets many use cases without requiring layer 2 smart contracts (which will be added in the future).

* escrow accounts
* Loan payments
* Limit orders
* Subscriptions
* Collateralized obligations/loans

samlapoint,,," It's certainly possible that ALGO reaches several dollars in the near future but the second part of your prediction is just silly. Honestly, it's a red flag that reveals that you're new to the space and have a lot to learn. You also need to realize that even if there was a global economic collapse and people rushed into cryptocurrencies out of fear, they would be rushing into state backed CBDC's, stable-coins, and-or Bitcoin, not ALGO. I hope you understand that economies can't function properly with insane volatility.   


I could go on but I'm just going to refer to what the Algorand team themselves have said regarding how the Algorand Foundation plans to handle things. In short, they will manage it much-like a traditional company handles a stock. 

The Algorand Foundation plans a **slow and steady** rise and will **counterbalance volatility**. That's what true professionals do. This isn't the lottery.   


Please read the Algorand team's post from January about their tokenomics.   


&gt; In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivaled scalability. At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019. During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation. These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. As confirmed by the observation of market returns and volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.   
&gt;  
&gt;The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards. Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.   
&gt;  
&gt;Conditional Vesting   
&gt;  
&gt;The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report. The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.   
&gt;  
&gt;In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

Also, an analyst recently [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1295457293283266560) a short-term ALGO chart that I completely agree with.

As for predictions, I think ALGO could reach $1.50-$2 by the end of the year as long as things continue in this direction. If it gains enough momentum, it could go significantly higher. Just depends on whether or not it gets caught up in the hype cycle. Either way, I plan on holding for some time.

bigjohnston111,,,"Serious issues with this article. Who writes this stuff? Either they don’t understand or they are purposefully misleading. Where do we begin?

1. “The platform chooses the token holders irrespective of the size of their stake.” - This is patently false if referring to Algorand. I won’t even put it in my own words. Algorand clearly explains this. 

“What makes this protocol pure proof-of-stake is the fact that users are chosen to participate in the protocol based on the stake (number of algos) that they have. The VRF behaves similarly to a weighted lottery; it is as if every algo in an account gets its own lottery ticket. The more algos in an online account, the better chance the account has of being selected to participate.”

[See: Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/what-we-do/technology/protocol-overview)

2. “Algorand can offer an alternative to other platforms such as Ethereum and EOS in the DeFi space.” - Makes a statement of offering an alternative but fails to explain why.

3. “Algorand has several features that make it stand apart from other platforms in the market.” - states several features, does not name anything after the sentence then offers it at the end of the article. 

4. “The platform promises and delivers speed, security, and decentralization.” - does not deliver decentralization if the backbone of the network is incentivized only for a select (i.e., centralized) group. Not many people open and run a business to lose money. Non-profits even need operational expenses. To think that  thousands of relay node operators will donate their time, effort, and resources to run the network is absurd. If that’s the case, do not reward the current reward earning relay node operators and find out where this will lead.

5. “ Algorand has another advantage over other DeFi platforms: creating and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications on Algorand is cheaper than other platforms.” - what empirical data is referenced to support this statement?

6. “Compared to other blockchains in the DeFi and smart contract space, The Algorand platform has lower costs for creating, deploying, and running smart contracts and decentralized applications.” - Where is the empirical data to support the position? What data/study is being referenced?

New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivalled scalability.

At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:

1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019.

 During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.

2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.

3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. 

The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation.

These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. 

The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. 

As confirmed by the observation of market returns and
volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.

The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially
by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards.

Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.

Conditional Vesting:

 The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report.

 The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). 

In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. 

This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.

The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.

In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. 

This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

New Sales Target:

 In its first communication a few days after the inaugural auction, the freshly appointed EAC pointed out that, in spite of the high participation and fundraising results of the auction, some auction features could be responsible for the initial high Algo volatility and speculative downward trend. One of these features was the 90% Refund, a right owned by the auction buyers only, and not directly associated with the Algos bought at auction.

On August 1, the Early Redemption of Auction Refund was announced: auction buyers could receive 85% early redemption if they transferred Algos back to the Foundation.

This way 19.9M Algos, out of a total of 25M Algos sold at the auction, were permanently retired from supply and eventually burnt by the Foundation.

The total supply from direct Foundation sales, planned to approach 1B over 2019 and 2020, was eventually amounted to around 6M in 2019. Now the Foundation has decided to resume sales to fund research and ecosystem development, but with a maximum possible amount of 150M in 2020, and will structure the sales to have the minimum impact on the market dynamics. Reformed Participation Rewards

The Participation Rewards in Algorand are distributed evenly to everyone. Even if the Algo has a fixed supply, so that no permanent devaluation is possible, such an even distribution can have an inflationary effect in the short or medium term. This becomes more likely if the amount of rewards is a high percentage of the circulating supply.

Considering the above reductions of circulating supply, the originally planned rewards
had become unsustainable. In order to remain consistent with the reduced supply
implemented by the Foundation the rewards had to be adjusted, and this has been recently implemented by the Foundation, choosing a gradual adjustment detailed in: https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics 

This is likely to have no effect on the Algo holders, since what is not obtained by rewards can now be obtained by Algo stability and strength due to supply moving more in harmony with demand.

Market Analysis:
 
 The quantitative analysis of the market dynamics confirms that the Algo market is
headed in the right direction. Price volatility was near to 150% in the first three months after the inaugural auction, but it has almost halved to 77% in the three months after the first reforms. The average daily return has moved from -2.43% in the first three months to 0.4% in the last quarter of 2019. These results are confirmed by regression of the Algo price against the Bitcoin price, the benchmark of the cryptocurrency market. The correlation between Algo and Bitcoin remains rather high, as expected, and regression shows a beta around 70% which is stable across the whole Algo life. But the alpha, representing the relative strength of the Algo vs Bitcoin, has moved from less than -2% in the first three months to more than +0.4% in the last three-month period, a figure indicating a stable market headed for moderate, steady growth.

Conclusion:

 The Algorand governance has proven able to address the over-supply issue. This was
made possible by a responsive community participating in the economic reform, partly
guiding and partly following the Foundation efforts towards stability and steady growth.

The new year sees the Algo start with both enhanced technology and enhanced crypto economics, where supply growth has been thoroughly reformed and brought in line with the growth of demand, the quantitative fundamentals appear strong, and the platform appears ready to host those applications that can only flourish under superior technology and stable economy.",True,0,1599004661,,False,0,g3nr3o7,t3_ikllho,t3_ikllho,1611467736.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/ikllho/algorand_exposed_insider_nodes_insider_whales/g3nr3o7/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1489635157.0,t2_1686ym,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,,,[],,,False,[],,,,,

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

[deleted],,,"I don't know when it will take off, but it seems like the price has establish a floor in the 0.20 to 0.28 range, and upper resistance at 0.34.

But in Bitcoin Bull-markets, which we are entering, alt-coins tend to grow faster than Bitcoin.  I think this is partly because coins with larger market caps grow slower than ones with smaller ones, so ALGO has a much higher ""potential"" growth over the next few years.

Algo seems highly undervalued, given it's smaller market cap, the quality of the team, it's low cost, low centralization, and high speed.  I think it's something that many people will find, once they feel confident enough with the crypto bull run to explore Alt coins again.

Especially when you compare Algo to other Alts, with less scalability, higher costs, more centralization, less qualified teams, or with known scammers (ex: Craig Wright lolz).

Another place I expect near term adoption is in enterprise level custodial solutions.  Large enterprises increasingly want to be able to hold crypto without the ""risk"" of storing their own keys.  This is to help diversify the risks of holding all fiats.  Some of those companies (and investors) will opt to have at least some of their crypto earning staking rewards.

Right now the number of coins with simple and easy enough staking rewards, that they can be implemented in third party enterprise custodial solutions is limited.  Like coin-base custody only offers staking for Tezos and Algorand.  Binance has staking for Algorand and Cosmos.

Given the low cost and ease of adoption for Algorand when it comes to staking (supporting the network and getting paid), as well as the financial incentive for banks that are now storing cryptocurrencies to not only store Algorand for customers, but promote customers purchasing it so both the bank and the customer can earn staking rewards... it's pretty obviously how things roll out from here.  It's one of the advantageous, Algorand has of having so many Game Theory Geniuses on their team.

&amp;#x200B;

But with price I expect some kind of roller coaster in price in the near term, and those who are going to jump off and hurt themselves when algo takes a little dip, they should probably get off right now for their own safety.  Up or Down... who knows where it will go in the short term.  But to me, big growth over the longer term seems almost inevitable.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"
Cardano has missed deadlines so many times and this is reflected in the price. When asked about the big end of August announcement that didn't happen, Charles replied ""FU you piece of..."".

When Dan Larimer kicked Charles out of BitShares years ago, he said: ""Charles is a salesman that tells everyone what they want to hear and has no compulsion with stretching the truth to absurd lengths or telling outright lies.""

Charles is a very smart guy and Cardano will probably be a great coin, but he is also an over confident narcissist and there seems to be truth in that quote with regards to why there are so many missed deadlines, and why the Cardano ICO was in 2015 and it is still just a centralized token to this day. It took weeks before Charles addressed the missed ""Shelly in Q2"" deadline, and when he did address it, it was with a serious attitude and no mea culpa.

Cardano won't have a real mainnnet until Shelley is live and they will start with 100% permissioned nodes and work down to 0. Once Shelley is actually live, yeah Cardano should go higher.

Algorand also needs to open up it's node relays to not be permissioned, my guess is before Shelley is 0% permissioned.

Did you know Algorand's inventor Silvio Micali is co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs as well as the VRF central to the consensus of both Algorand and Cardano?

What are you excited about with Cardano, Shelley, Plutus, Marlowe, etc? Maybe even Atala? 

With Algorand, I'm excited about:

That is from the official website but doesn’t massively clear up the methodology for me... also interestingly I was under the impression that only 1-1.5bio had been put into circulation so far (coinbase data), but according to Algorand that figure is above 3.5bio of which (as you say) 2.3bio is currently being staked.

Com as principais universidades científicas da China, Europa, Oriente Médio, Canadá e Estados Unidos, as instituições de associação inaugural representam uma mistura diversificada de líderes influentes em ciência da computação e inovação em blockchain. Estabelecidos para oferecer uma oportunidade para alunos e professores ingressarem na comunidade Algorand, participarem da inovação disruptiva e contribuírem para a nova economia do conhecimento sem fronteiras, os membros fundadores compartilham a visão da Fundação Algorand sobre o potencial do blockchain como uma força para a justiça social e global. Boa.
Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Would you suggest purchasing Algo on Crypto, or using Coinbase instead? I downloaded the Algorand Wallet so once I make my purchase of Algo I can transfer it to the Algorand Wallet instead of BlockFi... this part is losing me a bit haha.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part of these groups.",True,0,1566158962,,False,0,exct5it,t3_cpgh9o,t3_cpgh9o,1574434894.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/cpgh9o/coinbase_listing/exct5it/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

It is such a smart approach to put as much functionality in layer 1 as Algorand has, as everything executes quickly and cheaply with simple code that is easy to verify.

Their Layer 1 smart contracts in addition to standard assets can do this:

* Fungible tokens (stable coins, reward points)
* Non fungible tokens (game items, real estate)
* Restricted fungible tokens (securities, certificates)
* Restricted non fungible tokens (real estate, regulatory certificates)
* Atomic transfers - either all transactions in group happen or none at all
* Non custodial decentralized exchanges
* Escrow accounts
* Crowdfunding
* Securitized loans
* Loan payments
* Delegated account management
* Cross chain atomic transfers
* Interface with oracles

But I still have some data to work out so that is too low I think. .28 looks within range right now 2-3 weeks out but I may need a refinement if there is a bounce. Personally, I think we’re on a decline for a bit. Still watching the trends but if you look at my earlier post, the first bottom I called was .34.

[deleted],,,"**The Supply Cap**

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

The supply is capped at 10 billion.  There will never be more than 10 billion algo and all 10 billion already exists.  It is given out over time or sold to incentivize things like network growth and people setting up nodes.

[https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter](https://nomics.com/assets/algo-algorand#converter)

Out of the 10 billion, 803 million are currently circulating.

Most websites show the market cap (total value of all the coins) for Algorand at 247 million so they must be only calculating that market cap for the total coins in circulation.

Because at the current price of 0.298  per algo that's a **2.9 billion usd market cap** when we account for all 10 billion coins.  For comparison **Bitcoin's market cap is 266 billion** right now, when we account for all 21 million bitcoin's that will exist.

Ethereum doesn't even have a supply cap, so it'll just keep inflating forever making it's future market cap infinite.

So I don't think algorand's market cap is too high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Supply Rate**

But I imagine most people are concerned with the Supply rate.  Which is how fast are Algor and being given out (for things like staking) and put into circulation?

And the answer is, it appears to be that it's being managed by the team.

Here's a quote from the website:

*"" In the foreseeable future, it is our primary goal at the Foundation to increase the amount of rewards in line with the growth of the circulating supply corresponding to community feedback and market conditions. ""*

[https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics](https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics)

So it's kind of like how a central bank manages an economy, and they are adjusting rewards and things in real time to promote maximum growth.

Many crypto enthusiasts probably dislike this because it's people making decisions, and people can become corrupt or make bad decisions and they want everything coded in stone.

But I would argue that a bunch of game theoretic geniuses adjusting variables in real time with the financial goal of growing the value of Algorand (because that's how they can get rich also), is actually a good thing.

Take for example, staking rewards.  Algorand is the only cryptocurrency for which staking rewards are being offered by both coinbase custody and binance, so obviously these game theory guys are doing the right things to maximize adoption, especially considering there are plenty of cryptocurrencies that have been around longer and still haven't achieved that.

Those rewards should increase crypto bank adoption as well, banks make a percentage of that income.  All of this increases faster adoption and growth.

What these changing rates mean for the price, is that the price short term is less predictable because the inflation is less predictable so the rate of inflation's effect on the price is less predictable.  This risk can be greatly mitigated if you just stake the algorand that you do have, which is not difficult and anyone can do.

But knowing it's all being done, most likely, to maximize growth of the network is good, because that reflects in a price increase.  I'm welcome to hear other opinions on this.  I'm just reading and learning like everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Msc.**

As far as burned tokens that's 19.9m.  But that's a pretty small amount relative to the market cap, so I wouldn't worry about it.  Burning a token is when it's removed forever from supply.

bigjohnston111,,,"You’re not entirely correct. There is more than meets the eye. The relay nodes are not decentralized. Reward earning relay nodes are whitelisted much like XRP. The project looks like XRP in some ways. Preferred nodes in XRP are run by trusted nodes and university. Algorand reward earning relay mode are run by trusted groups and universities. 

People will jump at saying the relay nodes are not a part of consensus however relay nodes are the backbone of Algorand and play an important part in consensus.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

It's a bit embarrassing how ham-handed they handled the ICO.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

Edit: They are changing their native token from ERD to eGLD (Elrond Gold) but it's not backed by Gold.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

ReneRGN,,,"&gt;fully believe in the tech, but the way they created the foundation and are running it like a business is not really good for their public perception.

Thanks for your insights! I like that spirit of people generally believing this is a great project. But yeah, it's dangerous if the auctions likely turn out harmful for early investors.  
Where did you find the information about 25M being released every two weeks? I did not notice that in the token dynamics even though I was already wondering about the graph being continuous and not a step function.  


About the 2.5B tokens for the foundation: Yeah I'm worried about that, too.  In the AMA video Steve Kokinos brushed this off pretty fast by pointing out that this makes the network more secure. Well, and centralized. For example comparing it to Cardano, the foundation holds a modest 5 / 45 B tokens. Algorand starting with a quarter of the whole assets raises an eyebrow. I don't think it's bad intention, but pretty bad practice.

There was one auction at $2.50 then the price crashed from node relays selling their rewards so auctions have been paused for now and will resume at some point. Also node relay rewards have been greatly reduced by spreading out over more years and a bottom in pricing seems to have formed.

To my knowledge, Coinbase’s USDC within their app is also on ETH rather than Algorand. 

Coinbase, based on your region, can sometimes limit what you can buy and transfer, which is why I mentioned Binance.

I don’t think I’ve gone through the full KYC process - I can’t deposit or withdraw funds on Binance.

I'm in a wait-and-watch mode with this project.. my guess is they will likely be one of the POS systems along with ETH, Tezos and Cardano to survive the alt coin winter.  

Why is price falling with the Coinbase listing?  Well the  Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were  constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy  just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different  now.

Furthermore, their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed  to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential  was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking  rewards.

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In  order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a   diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,   and other research institutions volunteered to support the network   prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while   also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true   decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the   Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand   protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For  their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created  to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.   The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept  online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It   is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness   of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.   However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to   selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In  response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase  the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher  rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of  time.* 

*This   will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics  while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to  support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a  decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.   Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the  federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research  institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market  causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's  time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and  started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.   Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They  didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups  benefited from your hard earned cash.

In  response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a  means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by  ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the  select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part  of these groups.

It looks more like the foundation gives a refund **in case** they will have their pockets full anyways. Because then it doesn't matter whom all the money comes from. So then they would happily provide refund because they got enough anyways.

But realistically, we'll end up far below the 1$ range.

A Fundação Algorand tem o prazer de anunciar o lançamento do seu Programa Universitário Global. Com as principais universidades científicas da China, Europa, Oriente Médio, Canadá e Estados Unidos, as instituições de associação inaugural representam uma mistura diversificada de líderes influentes em ciência da computação e inovação em blockchain. Estabelecidos para oferecer uma oportunidade para alunos e professores ingressarem na comunidade Algorand, participarem da inovação disruptiva e contribuírem para a nova economia do conhecimento sem fronteiras, os membros fundadores compartilham a visão da Fundação Algorand sobre o potencial do blockchain como uma força para a justiça social e global. Boa.
Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

What Algorand really offers and why I see it growing is their Pure Proof of Stake which is their unique way of proving transactions.  The guy whos heading Algorand, Silvio Micali, is an incredibly smart MIT professor (although, in fairness all people heading cryptocurrency are incredibly smart) The crypto technology used makes it possible to make something like 1000 transactions per second which is a vast improvement on most platforms and reduces the viability of a few kinds of major attacks in the process.  

There is always the chance someone comes up with a better solution, but I see this growing personally.  I like the technology and think it is currently underappreciated and view computationally expensive transactions as the largest issue with crypto today.    This solves some of those issues, and while I'll still be watching the options while I hold I think that this is one of the better options out there.

While singing their praises it's worth recognizing that superior tech doesn't always win, and I can't really speak to how well they are marketing their solution.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"
The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand. They hopefully won't make additional business mistakes and  I agree increasing the regular staking rewards that don't require KYC would be a great move, as well as burning tokens.",True,0,1568816493,,False,0,f0oogcs,t3_d4y9tz,t1_f0mlpaa,1577149598.0,2,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/d4y9tz/whatll_happen_to_algo_in_next_two_years/f0oogcs/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1497962268.0,t2_4ma6lzt,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,False,,,,,,

Com as principais universidades científicas da China, Europa, Oriente Médio, Canadá e Estados Unidos, as instituições de associação inaugural representam uma mistura diversificada de líderes influentes em ciência da computação e inovação em blockchain. Estabelecidos para oferecer uma oportunidade para alunos e professores ingressarem na comunidade Algorand, participarem da inovação disruptiva e contribuírem para a nova economia do conhecimento sem fronteiras, os membros fundadores compartilham a visão da Fundação Algorand sobre o potencial do blockchain como uma força para a justiça social e global. Boa.
Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

&gt;If that is the case what is the risk of having an online account -vs- and offline account on a wallet connected to an active node? As Algo is proof of stake I can see why it is beneficial to have many active stakes so I'm a little surprised there seems to be no structural incentive to keep stakes online.

You can actually go online without the secret key on the participation node. Generate the participation key from another location, then move that key over to the participation node. That is more secure: if the participation node is compromised, they still don't have access to the secret key.

This is also a part of the reason that the Algorand Foundation has such a large initial stake that they do not circulate. Until more participants start joining the consensus, they provide some stability and protection against attacks while the chain is young.

Cardano has missed deadlines so many times and this is reflected in the price. When asked about the big end of August announcement that didn't happen, Charles replied ""FU you piece of..."".

When Dan Larimer kicked Charles out of BitShares years ago, he said: ""Charles is a salesman that tells everyone what they want to hear and has no compulsion with stretching the truth to absurd lengths or telling outright lies.""

Charles is a very smart guy and Cardano will probably be a great coin, but he is also an over confident narcissist and there seems to be truth in that quote with regards to why there are so many missed deadlines, and why the Cardano ICO was in 2015 and it is still just a centralized token to this day. It took weeks before Charles addressed the missed ""Shelly in Q2"" deadline, and when he did address it, it was with a serious attitude and no mea culpa.

Cardano won't have a real mainnnet until Shelley is live and they will start with 100% permissioned nodes and work down to 0. Once Shelley is actually live, yeah Cardano should go higher.

Algorand also needs to open up it's node relays to not be permissioned, my guess is before Shelley is 0% permissioned.

Did you know Algorand's inventor Silvio Micali is co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs as well as the VRF central to the consensus of both Algorand and Cardano?

The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand. They hopefully won't make additional business mistakes and  I agree increasing the regular staking rewards that don't require KYC would be a great move, as well as burning tokens.",True,0,1568816493,,False,0,f0oogcs,t3_d4y9tz,t1_f0mlpaa,1577149598.0,2,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/d4y9tz/whatll_happen_to_algo_in_next_two_years/f0oogcs/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1497962268.0,t2_4ma6lzt,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,False,,,,,,

Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Or people are silly and prefer to loose 65% instead of use the buy back in 1 year and lose only 10%
Or the team is selling tons of token to make money on the exchanges
Or people don’t trust they will buy back and try to escape ! 

We know nothing about the project, just that the founder is famous, the fundation is registered in Singapour, nothing wrong about it, but whom can ensure that the founder didn’t received a 10m$ check from a rich businessman to design this project and now this rich business man is having fun selling millions of Algo on the exchange cause the volumes are incredible !

dolle,,,"Thanks! Hmm, from skimming [the whitepaper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132757) it was not my impression that you would first have to stake your funds in order to participate. In particular, this quote (page 2) suggests that no setup which would reveal your intention to participate is necessary:

&gt;Finally, an adversary may target a committee member once that member sends a message in BA⋆.BA⋆mitigates this attack by requiring committee members to speak just once. Thus, once a committee member sends his message (exposing his identity to an adversary),the committee member becomes irrelevant to BA⋆

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

(1) Keeping an Algorand node online exposes your funds to more risk because you need the private key to compute the VRF proof that you ""won the lottery"", hence the key must be kept in memory on a publicly exposed machine.

(2) The operational costs of keeping an Algorand node online are probably not comparable to BitTorrent.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"I posted this in another thread...  fwiw, I'm very interested in this project as they're doing some really interesting work in the POS space and their tech does seem promising... the tokenomics are troubling at these early stages.  I'm in a wait-and-watch mode with this project.. my guess is they will likely be one of the POS systems along with ETH, Tezos and Cardano to survive the alt coin winter.  

Why is price falling with the Coinbase listing?  Well the  Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were  constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy  just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different  now.

Furthermore, their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed  to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential  was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking  rewards.

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In  order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a   diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,   and other research institutions volunteered to support the network   prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while   also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true   decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the   Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand   protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For  their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created  to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.   The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept  online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It   is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness   of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.   However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to   selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In  response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase  the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher  rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of  time.* 

*This   will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics  while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to  support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a  decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.   Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the  federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research  institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market  causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's  time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and  started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.   Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They  didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups  benefited from your hard earned cash.

In  response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a  means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by  ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the  select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part  of these groups.

ReneRGN,,,"&gt;fully believe in the tech, but the way they created the foundation and are running it like a business is not really good for their public perception.

But I'm still going to watch closely and buy some with small funds, I just don't see it going anywhere near the mo

Thanks for your insights! I like that spirit of people generally believing this is a great project. But yeah, it's dangerous if the auctions likely turn out harmful for early investors.  
Where did you find the information about 25M being released every two weeks? I did not notice that in the token dynamics even though I was already wondering about the graph being continuous and not a step function.  


About the 2.5B tokens for the foundation: Yeah I'm worried about that, too.  In the AMA video Steve Kokinos brushed this off pretty fast by pointing out that this makes the network more secure. Well, and centralized. For example comparing it to Cardano, the foundation holds a modest 5 / 45 B tokens. Algorand starting with a quarter of the whole assets raises an eyebrow. I don't think it's bad intention, but pretty bad practice.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"I posted this in another thread...  fwiw, I'm very interested in this project as they're doing some really interesting work in the POS space and their tech does seem promising... the tokenomics are troubling at these early stages.  I'm in a wait-and-watch mode with this project.. my guess is they will likely be one of the POS systems along with ETH, Tezos and Cardano to survive the alt coin winter.  

Why is price falling with the Coinbase listing?  Well the  Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were  constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy  just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different  now.

Furthermore, their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed  to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential  was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking  rewards.

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In  order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a   diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,   and other research institutions volunteered to support the network   prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while   also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true   decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the   Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand   protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For  their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created  to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.   The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept  online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It   is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness   of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.   However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to   selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In  response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase  the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher  rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of  time.* 

*This   will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics  while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to  support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a  decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.   Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the  federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research  institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market  causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's  time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and  started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.   Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They  didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups  benefited from your hard earned cash.

In  response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a  means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by  ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the  select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part  of these groups.

I want to see better supply distribution and more transparency regarding num nodes and disbursement along with TPS and other metrics holding the waterline before I'm a buyer.  I'd also like to see more information about plans for integration of smart contracts, metadata and other second layer computational architecture.",True,0,1566239533,,False,0,exffpsy,t3_csffkr,t3_csffkr,1575111080.0,7,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/csffkr/why_is_the_price_dumping_even_after_being_listed/exffpsy/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

\- Set a date/time event that everyone can agree to do something spectacular for the Algorand project that helps it get noticed.

\- Have volunteer Recruiters... People that go out to explain the benefits of investing into Algorand.

\- Talk about the project while in game chats or discuss at popular events and give them information that helps them find it.

\- Find out if the Algorand project team is okay with creating promotional items to help advertise (T-Shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, hats, pens, personal blogs that are searchable, etc)

I could go on but I'm just going to refer to what the Algorand team themselves have said regarding how the Algorand Foundation plans to handle things. In short, they will manage it much-like a traditional company handles a stock. 

The Algorand Foundation plans a **slow and steady** rise and will **counterbalance volatility**. That's what true professionals do. This isn't the lottery.   


Please read the Algorand team's post from January about their tokenomics.   


&gt; In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivaled scalability. At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019. During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation. These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. As confirmed by the observation of market returns and volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.   
&gt;  
&gt;The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards. Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.   
&gt;  
&gt;Conditional Vesting   
&gt;  
&gt;The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report. The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.   
&gt;  
&gt;In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

A price over a dollar is way too much, that's why ""you can't lose more than 10%"" doesn't really count. It looks more like the foundation gives a refund **in case** they will have their pockets full anyways. Because then it doesn't matter whom all the money comes from.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

It's a bit embarrassing how ham-handed they handled the ICO.  You can pick either gross incompetence on the part of the economic architects or you can pick the project operating as a borderline scam.

The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand. They hopefully won't make additional business mistakes and  I agree increasing the regular staking rewards that don't require KYC would be a great move, as well as burning tokens.",True,0,1568816493,,False,0,f0oogcs,t3_d4y9tz,t1_f0mlpaa,1577149598.0,2,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/d4y9tz/whatll_happen_to_algo_in_next_two_years/f0oogcs/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1497962268.0,t2_4ma6lzt,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,False,,,,,,

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency.

Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

I replied to someone earlier about pros and cons of the wallet as well with a couple other points, have a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/lf9pbp/just_got_into_algo/gml120k?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) if you want a little more info.

bigjohnston111,,,"You’re not entirely correct. There is more than meets the eye. The relay nodes are not decentralized. Reward earning relay nodes are whitelisted much like XRP. The project looks like XRP in some ways. Preferred nodes in XRP are run by trusted nodes and university. Algorand reward earning relay mode are run by trusted groups and universities. 

People will jump at saying the relay nodes are not a part of consensus however relay nodes are the backbone of Algorand and play an important part in consensus.

I would hope this doesn’t go the same way as XRP with the SEC but I’m left wondering why US persons were excluded from the super staking program.

&gt;If that is the case what is the risk of having an online account -vs- and offline account on a wallet connected to an active node? As Algo is proof of stake I can see why it is beneficial to have many active stakes so I'm a little surprised there seems to be no structural incentive to keep stakes online.

You can actually go online without the secret key on the participation node. Generate the participation key from another location, then move that key over to the participation node. That is more secure: if the participation node is compromised, they still don't have access to the secret key.

This is also a part of the reason that the Algorand Foundation has such a large initial stake that they do not circulate. Until more participants start joining the consensus, they provide some stability and protection against attacks while the chain is young.

There are a lot of believers in this project who are not buying it just to make a quick buck but they believe that it will become the ultimate vehicle for making seamless electronic cross border transactions on top of using it as an ultimate defi platform.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"Lol, Charles admitted Atala has been in development for years before the announcement so dev level right before/after the announcement is meaningless. Perhaps Shelley would have been live last year if they didn't split up their resources? Keep in mind that once Shelley goes live it will take a while before it has 100% permissionless nodes.

Cardano ICO'd so far ahead of a working decentralized product (still not here yet 5 years later) which resulted in an underpriced ICO therefore IOHK  is under funded (relative to most coin devs) causing them to do Atala to try and earn cash and slow down Shelley as a result. 

Ultimately it's the tech that really matters and pricing will follow and the VRF that is central to Cardano and Algorand's consensus is co-invented by Silvio Micali, the founder of Algorand and also the co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs. Charles has said Algorand is Cardano's biggest competition and he is right to be worried.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

**TL;DR:**  
1) *True Decentralization solved* \-- How? The network is not controlled by a few miners or validator set since proposers and committees are randomly selected using Cryptographic sortition and VRF. This means 'node centralization' 'stakes centralization' doesn't happen. Network scales as nodes scale and adversary due to true randomness never know whom to target.  
2) *Scalability* \-- How? Algorand is scalable as nodes on network grow. Algorand gives instant finality (1-4 sec blocktime) unlike other non-final POS/ POW blockchains. The entire community agrees on the next block and confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users.  
3) *Security* \-- How? True randomness, no select group to target, no mining centralization, instant finality rending fork probability as zero. Secure against Static, Dynamic and Network adversaries.

Ultimately it's the tech that really matters and pricing will follow and the VRF that is central to Cardano and Algorand's consensus is co-invented by Silvio Micali, the founder of Algorand and also the co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs. Charles has said Algorand is Cardano's biggest competition and he is right to be worried.

Here's an exciting and long list of Algorand's upcoming tech:

Naki111,,,"You realise you can't lose 80% or 90% right the terms of the sale come with a guaranteed buyback of 90% the price in one year if the price is below so the most you can lose is 10%.


That being said the $10 upper end  and frequent auctions are there to discourage whale accumulation. If a whale buys out a entire auction for a certain price he would probably lose out a lot at next auction unless he could maintain that price continuously. This was done to stop large BTC holders basically controlling the coin from day one as they do with most icos it's to encourage a more diverse spread in market and hopefully stop market manipulation.


As for the price the interesting thing I'm watching for is Facebook Libra announcement on the 18th one day before the algorand auction.

Facebook had meetings with algorand many times late last year and earlier this year. 


Facebook bought out chainspace and dispanded the project only keeping the team because they required golang Devs.  Algorand would be the only project of this sort of scale that is developed in golang.


Christian catalini from algorands board was then brought across to Facebook to develop libra and advise on it.


The day algorand announced Dutch auction and mainnet for the 19th Facebook announced libra news this month on the 18th hours after.


Bison trail a interoperability protocol partnered with algorand is also on Libras board and large backers like usv back both.


Rumours right now are a deal between the 2 where libra gets use of algorands patents and the 2 platforms work together but we won't know until the 18th.

nighthawk24,,,"No, centralization through economics is not my preference, USD and fiat monies do that today,

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

Additionally, looking at Slack\[NYSE:WORK\] went IPO and the market cap as of now is $21 billion; I believe we are still in the stages of valuing the blockchain first companies and the token itself and Algorand's valuation between $3-7 billion at this stage does not surprise me.",True,0,1561142517,,False,0,erqg1pf,t3_c17szn,t1_erq79a1,1570476432.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c17szn/is_ada_going_to_win_against_algorand/erqg1pf/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1284768643.0,t2_4cqmz,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

I replied to someone earlier about pros and cons of the wallet as well with a couple other points, have a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/lf9pbp/just_got_into_algo/gml120k?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) if you want a little more info.

JesterBombs,,,"Yes ALGO is getting destroyed but my analysis shows despite the price decline more buys are initiated than sells.  Some of these 10% drops were fueled by less than $50k USD of volume.  I would argue that this is a major accumulation before price recovers and that price can move upwards just as easily.  Will it ever break back above $2, $1 or $0.50?  I don't know.  There's too many unknown variables.  That said, ALGO does check a lot of boxes when it comes to the team and tech in the crypto space and only a fool would neglect the fact that they've secured $200 million to grow and expand the Algorand network.  It is a significant advantage for it to trade on two of the most popular exchanges in Binance and CoinbasePro (to NY residents no less).

unknownstranger2,,,"Algo Market 2020: a revised Tokenomics by the Economic Advisory Committee 

January 2, 2020

Introduction:

 In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. 

New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivalled scalability.

At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:

1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019.

 During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.

2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.

3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. 

The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation.

These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. 

The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. 

As confirmed by the observation of market returns and
volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.

The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially
by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards.

Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.

Conditional Vesting:

 The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report.

 The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). 

In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. 

This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.

The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.

In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. 

This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

New Sales Target:

 In its first communication a few days after the inaugural auction, the freshly appointed EAC pointed out that, in spite of the high participation and fundraising results of the auction, some auction features could be responsible for the initial high Algo volatility and speculative downward trend. One of these features was the 90% Refund, a right owned by the auction buyers only, and not directly associated with the Algos bought at auction.

On August 1, the Early Redemption of Auction Refund was announced: auction buyers could receive 85% early redemption if they transferred Algos back to the Foundation.

This way 19.9M Algos, out of a total of 25M Algos sold at the auction, were permanently retired from supply and eventually burnt by the Foundation.

The total supply from direct Foundation sales, planned to approach 1B over 2019 and 2020, was eventually amounted to around 6M in 2019. Now the Foundation has decided to resume sales to fund research and ecosystem development, but with a maximum possible amount of 150M in 2020, and will structure the sales to have the minimum impact on the market dynamics. Reformed Participation Rewards

The Participation Rewards in Algorand are distributed evenly to everyone. Even if the Algo has a fixed supply, so that no permanent devaluation is possible, such an even distribution can have an inflationary effect in the short or medium term. This becomes more likely if the amount of rewards is a high percentage of the circulating supply.

Considering the above reductions of circulating supply, the originally planned rewards
had become unsustainable. In order to remain consistent with the reduced supply
implemented by the Foundation the rewards had to be adjusted, and this has been recently implemented by the Foundation, choosing a gradual adjustment detailed in: https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics 

This is likely to have no effect on the Algo holders, since what is not obtained by rewards can now be obtained by Algo stability and strength due to supply moving more in harmony with demand.

Market Analysis:
 
 The quantitative analysis of the market dynamics confirms that the Algo market is
headed in the right direction. Price volatility was near to 150% in the first three months after the inaugural auction, but it has almost halved to 77% in the three months after the first reforms. The average daily return has moved from -2.43% in the first three months to 0.4% in the last quarter of 2019. These results are confirmed by regression of the Algo price against the Bitcoin price, the benchmark of the cryptocurrency market. The correlation between Algo and Bitcoin remains rather high, as expected, and regression shows a beta around 70% which is stable across the whole Algo life. But the alpha, representing the relative strength of the Algo vs Bitcoin, has moved from less than -2% in the first three months to more than +0.4% in the last three-month period, a figure indicating a stable market headed for moderate, steady growth.

Conclusion:

 The Algorand governance has proven able to address the over-supply issue. This was
made possible by a responsive community participating in the economic reform, partly
guiding and partly following the Foundation efforts towards stability and steady growth.

The new year sees the Algo start with both enhanced technology and enhanced crypto economics, where supply growth has been thoroughly reformed and brought in line with the growth of demand, the quantitative fundamentals appear strong, and the platform appears ready to host those applications that can only flourish under superior technology and stable economy.",True,0,1599004661,,False,0,g3nr3o7,t3_ikllho,t3_ikllho,1611467736.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/ikllho/algorand_exposed_insider_nodes_insider_whales/g3nr3o7/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1489635157.0,t2_1686ym,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,,,[],,,False,[],,,,,

Last time complete speculation was what was driving the price on the majority of ICO's. Teams needed a white paper and an idea and fools were giving them ETH and BTC in exchange for future wishful promises. 

Now we see DeFi projects, and new innovative block chain platforms dominating the market cap charts. Many of these have actual value propositions behind them or actual working new technological advances over the current big dogs Eth and Btc. 

And we are seeing large institutions actually starting to massively invest in a few big coins. This is massive amounts of new money, much of which will likely trail down into the projects below which actually deserve it. 

All of this is to say, I do not think we are in a situation like 2018 again.

The Algorand Foundation plans a **slow and steady** rise and will **counterbalance volatility**. That's what true professionals do. This isn't the lottery.   


Please read the Algorand team's post from January about their tokenomics.   


&gt; In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivaled scalability. At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019. During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation. These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. As confirmed by the observation of market returns and volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.   
&gt;  
&gt;The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards. Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.   
&gt;  
&gt;Conditional Vesting   
&gt;  
&gt;The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report. The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.   
&gt;  
&gt;In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

oakley56fila,,,"I moved my meager horde of Algorand from Coinbase to the Algorand Wallet app to check first-hand the differences in earning rates. I'm coming up on exactly 24 hours since I transferred, and then I'm going to compare my daily Algorand reward earnings from Coinbase, averaged over the days held on that Exchange, against my initial day's haul in the Algo wallet.
  
Algorand is reporting a current annual yield of 7.07% at the time of this post: https://algoexplorer.io/rewards-calculator.  
  
Coinbase states: ""When you hold Algorand on Coinbase, you can earn rewards. 6.00% is the estimated annual rewards rate, which may change over time. It's based on the Algorand rewards generated by the protocol."" And the Coinbase fees page list's their Staking fee at 25%:  
  
&gt; ""Coinbase will distribute this reward to you after receipt by Coinbase, minus a 25% commission.""  

https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees#staking-services  
  
Since I plan on going long with Alogrand, I want to maximize my rewards. I also think a 25% commission is extremely steep.  
  
My calculations show that Coinbase was taking 24.63% of the Algorand that I'm currently seeing earned through my Algorand Wallet. No real surprise there, I'm sure they are taking their reported 25% cut. 
  
So, in my opinion as a rando reddit user, if you're planning on holding you should gain the full value of your Algorand and transfer it to a wallet.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part of these groups.",True,0,1566158962,,False,0,exct5it,t3_cpgh9o,t3_cpgh9o,1574434894.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/cpgh9o/coinbase_listing/exct5it/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

It's fast on the happy path when everyone agrees on what happened, because a sufficient majority of the committee will vote for the winning block as valid. When there's disagreement, it takes longer, but the voting thresholds are set so that disagreement is extremely unlikely, unless a large fraction of algorand votes are controlled by a dishonest actor.

There is another way things can slow down: if the network is partitioned, so that large fractions of the voters can't see each other, then a majority vote can't be established.

Each TEAL op has an associated cost estimate and the program cost estimate must total less than 20000 (consensus parameter LogicSigMaxCost). Most ops have an estimated cost of 1, but a few slow crypto ops are much higher.""

While the TEAL scripts have limits, combined with ASA (custom tokens) and atomic transfers meets many use cases without requiring layer 2 smart contracts (which will be added in the future).

People will jump at saying the relay nodes are not a part of consensus however relay nodes are the backbone of Algorand and play an important part in consensus.

You don't seem to understand how pipleining works:

0 seconds - when pipelining is first started, 1 block proposed

.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block already waiting for finalization

1 second - another block proposed, 2 blocks already waiting for finalization

1.5 seconds - another block proposed, 3 blocks already waiting for finalization

2 seconds - another block proposed, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

2.5 seconds - another block proposed, 1 block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

3 seconds - another block proposed, another block finalized, 4 blocks already waiting for finalization

And this keeps happening, 1 new block proposed, 1 new block finalized, every .5 seconds.

So yes, 46,0000 TPS for Algorand versus the current toy like 50-150 TPS of Cardano which has finality in what 6 minutes or so versus 2.5 second finality in Algorand? Lol.

[deleted],,,"I don't know when it will take off, but it seems like the price has establish a floor in the 0.20 to 0.28 range, and upper resistance at 0.34.

But in Bitcoin Bull-markets, which we are entering, alt-coins tend to grow faster than Bitcoin.  I think this is partly because coins with larger market caps grow slower than ones with smaller ones, so ALGO has a much higher ""potential"" growth over the next few years.

Algo seems highly undervalued, given it's smaller market cap, the quality of the team, it's low cost, low centralization, and high speed.  I think it's something that many people will find, once they feel confident enough with the crypto bull run to explore Alt coins again.

Especially when you compare Algo to other Alts, with less scalability, higher costs, more centralization, less qualified teams, or with known scammers (ex: Craig Wright lolz).

Another place I expect near term adoption is in enterprise level custodial solutions.  Large enterprises increasingly want to be able to hold crypto without the ""risk"" of storing their own keys.  This is to help diversify the risks of holding all fiats.  Some of those companies (and investors) will opt to have at least some of their crypto earning staking rewards.

Right now the number of coins with simple and easy enough staking rewards, that they can be implemented in third party enterprise custodial solutions is limited.  Like coin-base custody only offers staking for Tezos and Algorand.  Binance has staking for Algorand and Cosmos.

Given the low cost and ease of adoption for Algorand when it comes to staking (supporting the network and getting paid), as well as the financial incentive for banks that are now storing cryptocurrencies to not only store Algorand for customers, but promote customers purchasing it so both the bank and the customer can earn staking rewards... it's pretty obviously how things roll out from here.  It's one of the advantageous, Algorand has of having so many Game Theory Geniuses on their team.

&amp;#x200B;

But with price I expect some kind of roller coaster in price in the near term, and those who are going to jump off and hurt themselves when algo takes a little dip, they should probably get off right now for their own safety.  Up or Down... who knows where it will go in the short term.  But to me, big growth over the longer term seems almost inevitable.

Also, an analyst recently [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1295457293283266560) a short-term ALGO chart that I completely agree with.

As for predictions, I think ALGO could reach $1.50-$2 by the end of the year as long as things continue in this direction. If it gains enough momentum, it could go significantly higher. Just depends on whether or not it gets caught up in the hype cycle. Either way, I plan on holding for some time.

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

unknownstranger2,,,"Algo Market 2020: a revised Tokenomics by the Economic Advisory Committee 

January 2, 2020

Introduction:

 In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. 

New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivalled scalability.

At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:

1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019.

 During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.

2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.

3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. 

The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation.

These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. 

The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. 

As confirmed by the observation of market returns and
volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.

The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially
by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards.

Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.

Conditional Vesting:

 The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report.

 The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). 

In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. 

This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.

The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.

In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. 

This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

New Sales Target:

 In its first communication a few days after the inaugural auction, the freshly appointed EAC pointed out that, in spite of the high participation and fundraising results of the auction, some auction features could be responsible for the initial high Algo volatility and speculative downward trend. One of these features was the 90% Refund, a right owned by the auction buyers only, and not directly associated with the Algos bought at auction.

On August 1, the Early Redemption of Auction Refund was announced: auction buyers could receive 85% early redemption if they transferred Algos back to the Foundation.

This way 19.9M Algos, out of a total of 25M Algos sold at the auction, were permanently retired from supply and eventually burnt by the Foundation.

The total supply from direct Foundation sales, planned to approach 1B over 2019 and 2020, was eventually amounted to around 6M in 2019. Now the Foundation has decided to resume sales to fund research and ecosystem development, but with a maximum possible amount of 150M in 2020, and will structure the sales to have the minimum impact on the market dynamics. Reformed Participation Rewards

The Participation Rewards in Algorand are distributed evenly to everyone. Even if the Algo has a fixed supply, so that no permanent devaluation is possible, such an even distribution can have an inflationary effect in the short or medium term. This becomes more likely if the amount of rewards is a high percentage of the circulating supply.

Considering the above reductions of circulating supply, the originally planned rewards
had become unsustainable. In order to remain consistent with the reduced supply
implemented by the Foundation the rewards had to be adjusted, and this has been recently implemented by the Foundation, choosing a gradual adjustment detailed in: https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics 

This is likely to have no effect on the Algo holders, since what is not obtained by rewards can now be obtained by Algo stability and strength due to supply moving more in harmony with demand.

Market Analysis:
 
 The quantitative analysis of the market dynamics confirms that the Algo market is
headed in the right direction. Price volatility was near to 150% in the first three months after the inaugural auction, but it has almost halved to 77% in the three months after the first reforms. The average daily return has moved from -2.43% in the first three months to 0.4% in the last quarter of 2019. These results are confirmed by regression of the Algo price against the Bitcoin price, the benchmark of the cryptocurrency market. The correlation between Algo and Bitcoin remains rather high, as expected, and regression shows a beta around 70% which is stable across the whole Algo life. But the alpha, representing the relative strength of the Algo vs Bitcoin, has moved from less than -2% in the first three months to more than +0.4% in the last three-month period, a figure indicating a stable market headed for moderate, steady growth.

Conclusion:

 The Algorand governance has proven able to address the over-supply issue. This was
made possible by a responsive community participating in the economic reform, partly
guiding and partly following the Foundation efforts towards stability and steady growth.

The new year sees the Algo start with both enhanced technology and enhanced crypto economics, where supply growth has been thoroughly reformed and brought in line with the growth of demand, the quantitative fundamentals appear strong, and the platform appears ready to host those applications that can only flourish under superior technology and stable economy.",True,0,1599004661,,False,0,g3nr3o7,t3_ikllho,t3_ikllho,1611467736.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/ikllho/algorand_exposed_insider_nodes_insider_whales/g3nr3o7/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1489635157.0,t2_1686ym,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,,,[],,,False,[],,,,,

The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand. They hopefully won't make additional business mistakes and  I agree increasing the regular staking rewards that don't require KYC would be a great move, as well as burning tokens.",True,0,1568816493,,False,0,f0oogcs,t3_d4y9tz,t1_f0mlpaa,1577149598.0,2,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/d4y9tz/whatll_happen_to_algo_in_next_two_years/f0oogcs/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1497962268.0,t2_4ma6lzt,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,False,,,,,,

&gt;If that is the case what is the risk of having an online account -vs- and offline account on a wallet connected to an active node? As Algo is proof of stake I can see why it is beneficial to have many active stakes so I'm a little surprised there seems to be no structural incentive to keep stakes online.

You can actually go online without the secret key on the participation node. Generate the participation key from another location, then move that key over to the participation node. That is more secure: if the participation node is compromised, they still don't have access to the secret key.

This is also a part of the reason that the Algorand Foundation has such a large initial stake that they do not circulate. Until more participants start joining the consensus, they provide some stability and protection against attacks while the chain is young.

A price over a dollar is way too much, that's why ""you can't lose more than 10%"" doesn't really count.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

JesterBombs,,,"I'm always fascinated by the amount of focus people have on market cap in the crypto space.  Market cap is more relevant to mergers and acquisitions, neither of which applies when someone buys the majority share of any given token.  If Amazon has a bad day Bezos could lose billions of dollars... IF he sells his holdings at those lower prices.  Any major transfer of shares is regulated by the SEC and the bottom line is that market cap applies in that regard.  If everyone dumped Amazon at the same time the price and market cap would temporarily suffer but the fundamentals of Amazon are intact and price will adjust accordingly.  In that respect the same is true here except we don't know what Algorand will be able to accomplish in the future which is grounds to justify the price (and panic selling from reading articles like that).  In summary, if Algorand keeps building their network, offers benefits that other cryptos do not and increases usage the price will adjust accordingly and for reasons we simply won't know for sure until it happens.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

It's a bit embarrassing how ham-handed they handled the ICO.  You can pick either gross incompetence on the part of the economic architects or you can pick the project operating as a borderline scam.

bigjohnston111,,,"Serious issues with this article. Who writes this stuff? Either they don’t understand or they are purposefully misleading. Where do we begin?

1. “The platform chooses the token holders irrespective of the size of their stake.” - This is patently false if referring to Algorand. I won’t even put it in my own words. Algorand clearly explains this. 

“What makes this protocol pure proof-of-stake is the fact that users are chosen to participate in the protocol based on the stake (number of algos) that they have. The VRF behaves similarly to a weighted lottery; it is as if every algo in an account gets its own lottery ticket. The more algos in an online account, the better chance the account has of being selected to participate.”

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.

&gt;If that is the case what is the risk of having an online account -vs- and offline account on a wallet connected to an active node? As Algo is proof of stake I can see why it is beneficial to have many active stakes so I'm a little surprised there seems to be no structural incentive to keep stakes online.

The main being what people keep overlooking is the staking and participation rewards.


Between them they total 4.25 billion algos those rewards are distributed to holders for staking etc over 5 years at quite a decent rate the earlier in the more rewards received.


So first auction is 25 million plus you have algorands 2.5 billion which won't be sold but is used to secure the network as it gets distributed so you can't really count the 2.5 billion into circulation.

Every month roughly 50 million enters circulation more counting rewards etc but the rewards aren't sold there given to current holders for staking or participating network. 

So in 5 years 3 billion is sold but 4.2 billion is accumulated in staking rewards by holders so a token bought day 1 would give you I'd assume 2.5 tokens if held 5 years.

Cardano has missed deadlines so many times and this is reflected in the price. When asked about the big end of August announcement that didn't happen, Charles replied ""FU you piece of..."".

When Dan Larimer kicked Charles out of BitShares years ago, he said: ""Charles is a salesman that tells everyone what they want to hear and has no compulsion with stretching the truth to absurd lengths or telling outright lies.""

Charles is a very smart guy and Cardano will probably be a great coin, but he is also an over confident narcissist and there seems to be truth in that quote with regards to why there are so many missed deadlines, and why the Cardano ICO was in 2015 and it is still just a centralized token to this day. It took weeks before Charles addressed the missed ""Shelly in Q2"" deadline, and when he did address it, it was with a serious attitude and no mea culpa.

Cardano won't have a real mainnnet until Shelley is live and they will start with 100% permissioned nodes and work down to 0. Once Shelley is actually live, yeah Cardano should go higher.

Algorand also needs to open up it's node relays to not be permissioned, my guess is before Shelley is 0% permissioned.

Did you know Algorand's inventor Silvio Micali is co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs as well as the VRF central to the consensus of both Algorand and Cardano?

What are you excited about with Cardano, Shelley, Plutus, Marlowe, etc? Maybe even Atala?

_Jay-Bee_,,,"
In the new setup, a new block is finalized every .5 seconds and each block has up to 25,000 transactions. So 2 blocks per second with up to 25,000 transactions in each block is 50,000 TPS according to the definition of TPS. 

You are the one trying to make up a new definition of TPS, or perhaps you need to re-read the Alogrand PDF explaining this instead of googling about quantum superposition which is not a factor in large systems.

There is a 1% chance of a proposed block not being finalized which means you have to drop all in-flight blocks and start over (so longer latency whenever this happens).  You are correct, we'll have to see if this is higher than 1% or if Algorand's historical data holds. If the 1% chance of a failed block holds then that reduces the 50,000 TPS to 46,000 TPS on average, higher chances of failed blocks will reduce the average TPS accordingly and without pipelining you still have nearly 10,000 TPS.

Anyway, this is an amazing accomplishment to have a single main chain with such as high TPS and (when coin is fully distributed) full decentralization.

bigjohnston111,,,"You’re not entirely correct. There is more than meets the eye. The relay nodes are not decentralized. Reward earning relay nodes are whitelisted much like XRP. The project looks like XRP in some ways. Preferred nodes in XRP are run by trusted nodes and university. Algorand reward earning relay mode are run by trusted groups and universities. 

People will jump at saying the relay nodes are not a part of consensus however relay nodes are the backbone of Algorand and play an important part in consensus.

I would hope this doesn’t go the same way as XRP with the SEC but I’m left wondering why US persons were excluded from the super staking program.

bigjohnston111,,,"Serious issues with this article. Who writes this stuff? Either they don’t understand or they are purposefully misleading. Where do we begin?

1. “The platform chooses the token holders irrespective of the size of their stake.” - This is patently false if referring to Algorand. I won’t even put it in my own words. Algorand clearly explains this. 

“What makes this protocol pure proof-of-stake is the fact that users are chosen to participate in the protocol based on the stake (number of algos) that they have. The VRF behaves similarly to a weighted lottery; it is as if every algo in an account gets its own lottery ticket. The more algos in an online account, the better chance the account has of being selected to participate.”

[See: Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/what-we-do/technology/protocol-overview)

2. “Algorand can offer an alternative to other platforms such as Ethereum and EOS in the DeFi space.” - Makes a statement of offering an alternative but fails to explain why.

3. “Algorand has several features that make it stand apart from other platforms in the market.” - states several features, does not name anything after the sentence then offers it at the end of the article. 

4. “The platform promises and delivers speed, security, and decentralization.” - does not deliver decentralization if the backbone of the network is incentivized only for a select (i.e., centralized) group. Not many people open and run a business to lose money. Non-profits even need operational expenses. To think that  thousands of relay node operators will donate their time, effort, and resources to run the network is absurd. If that’s the case, do not reward the current reward earning relay node operators and find out where this will lead.

5. “ Algorand has another advantage over other DeFi platforms: creating and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications on Algorand is cheaper than other platforms.” - what empirical data is referenced to support this statement?

6. “Compared to other blockchains in the DeFi and smart contract space, The Algorand platform has lower costs for creating, deploying, and running smart contracts and decentralized applications.” - Where is the empirical data to support the position? What data/study is being referenced?

unknownstranger2,,,"Algo Market 2020: a revised Tokenomics by the Economic Advisory Committee 

January 2, 2020

Introduction:

 In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. 

New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivalled scalability.

At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:

1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019.

 During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.

2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.

3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. 

The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation.

These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. 

The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. 

As confirmed by the observation of market returns and
volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.

The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially
by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards.

Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.

Conditional Vesting:

 The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report.

 The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). 

In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. 

This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.

The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.

In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. 

This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

New Sales Target:

 In its first communication a few days after the inaugural auction, the freshly appointed EAC pointed out that, in spite of the high participation and fundraising results of the auction, some auction features could be responsible for the initial high Algo volatility and speculative downward trend. One of these features was the 90% Refund, a right owned by the auction buyers only, and not directly associated with the Algos bought at auction.

On August 1, the Early Redemption of Auction Refund was announced: auction buyers could receive 85% early redemption if they transferred Algos back to the Foundation.

This way 19.9M Algos, out of a total of 25M Algos sold at the auction, were permanently retired from supply and eventually burnt by the Foundation.

The total supply from direct Foundation sales, planned to approach 1B over 2019 and 2020, was eventually amounted to around 6M in 2019. Now the Foundation has decided to resume sales to fund research and ecosystem development, but with a maximum possible amount of 150M in 2020, and will structure the sales to have the minimum impact on the market dynamics. Reformed Participation Rewards

The Participation Rewards in Algorand are distributed evenly to everyone. Even if the Algo has a fixed supply, so that no permanent devaluation is possible, such an even distribution can have an inflationary effect in the short or medium term. This becomes more likely if the amount of rewards is a high percentage of the circulating supply.

Considering the above reductions of circulating supply, the originally planned rewards
had become unsustainable. In order to remain consistent with the reduced supply
implemented by the Foundation the rewards had to be adjusted, and this has been recently implemented by the Foundation, choosing a gradual adjustment detailed in: https://algorand.foundation/algo-dynamics 

This is likely to have no effect on the Algo holders, since what is not obtained by rewards can now be obtained by Algo stability and strength due to supply moving more in harmony with demand.

Market Analysis:
 
 The quantitative analysis of the market dynamics confirms that the Algo market is
headed in the right direction. Price volatility was near to 150% in the first three months after the inaugural auction, but it has almost halved to 77% in the three months after the first reforms. The average daily return has moved from -2.43% in the first three months to 0.4% in the last quarter of 2019. These results are confirmed by regression of the Algo price against the Bitcoin price, the benchmark of the cryptocurrency market. The correlation between Algo and Bitcoin remains rather high, as expected, and regression shows a beta around 70% which is stable across the whole Algo life. But the alpha, representing the relative strength of the Algo vs Bitcoin, has moved from less than -2% in the first three months to more than +0.4% in the last three-month period, a figure indicating a stable market headed for moderate, steady growth.

Conclusion:

 The Algorand governance has proven able to address the over-supply issue. This was

_Jay-Bee_,,,"Lol, Charles admitted Atala has been in development for years before the announcement so dev level right before/after the announcement is meaningless. Perhaps Shelley would have been live last year if they didn't split up their resources? Keep in mind that once Shelley goes live it will take a while before it has 100% permissionless nodes.

Cardano ICO'd so far ahead of a working decentralized product (still not here yet 5 years later) which resulted in an underpriced ICO therefore IOHK  is under funded (relative to most coin devs) causing them to do Atala to try and earn cash and slow down Shelley as a result. 

Ultimately it's the tech that really matters and pricing will follow and the VRF that is central to Cardano and Algorand's consensus is co-invented by Silvio Micali, the founder of Algorand and also the co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs. Charles has said Algorand is Cardano's biggest competition and he is right to be worried.

dolle,,,"Thanks! Hmm, from skimming [the whitepaper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132757) it was not my impression that you would first have to stake your funds in order to participate. In particular, this quote (page 2) suggests that no setup which would reveal your intention to participate is necessary:

&gt;Finally, an adversary may target a committee member once that member sends a message in BA⋆.BA⋆mitigates this attack by requiring committee members to speak just once. Thus, once a committee member sends his message (exposing his identity to an adversary),the committee member becomes irrelevant to BA⋆

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

(1) Keeping an Algorand node online exposes your funds to more risk because you need the private key to compute the VRF proof that you ""won the lottery"", hence the key must be kept in memory on a publicly exposed machine.

(2) The operational costs of keeping an Algorand node online are probably not comparable to BitTorrent.

The main being what people keep overlooking is the staking and participation rewards.


Between them they total 4.25 billion algos those rewards are distributed to holders for staking etc over 5 years at quite a decent rate the earlier in the more rewards received.


So first auction is 25 million plus you have algorands 2.5 billion which won't be sold but is used to secure the network as it gets distributed so you can't really count the 2.5 billion into circulation.

Every month roughly 50 million enters circulation more counting rewards etc but the rewards aren't sold there given to current holders for staking or participating network. 

So in 5 years 3 billion is sold but 4.2 billion is accumulated in staking rewards by holders so a token bought day 1 would give you I'd assume 2.5 tokens if held 5 years.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"Lol, Charles admitted Atala has been in development for years before the announcement so dev level right before/after the announcement is meaningless. Perhaps Shelley would have been live last year if they didn't split up their resources? Keep in mind that once Shelley goes live it will take a while before it has 100% permissionless nodes.

Cardano ICO'd so far ahead of a working decentralized product (still not here yet 5 years later) which resulted in an underpriced ICO therefore IOHK  is under funded (relative to most coin devs) causing them to do Atala to try and earn cash and slow down Shelley as a result. 

Ultimately it's the tech that really matters and pricing will follow and the VRF that is central to Cardano and Algorand's consensus is co-invented by Silvio Micali, the founder of Algorand and also the co-inventor of zero knowledge proofs. Charles has said Algorand is Cardano's biggest competition and he is right to be worried.

_Jay-Bee_,,,"I don't know enough about Elrond, below is my possibly wrong quick read of the first few pages of their whitepaper. It would be helpful to see a respected crypto person do an analysis on their security and abilities. 

Elrond states in their whitepaper that they have relaxed security guarantees versus Algorand in that Elrond's block validators are known at the start of the round so attackers have until the end of the round to possibly attack versus Algorand when you don't know who is validating until after the round is over.

In their white paper they say 5k TPS per shard but cross shard contracts take at least 5 blocks and not sure what their max blocks is. It might be that complex cross shard smart contracts takes many 10s of blocks. 

They want many shards to get their scaling so you should expect a large percentage of smart contract calls will be cross shard. With 5 second blocks that's at least 25 seconds and potentially much more and if the smart contract calls another cross shard smart contract that's a other 25+ seconds and so on. So if their setup works they could have high TPS but high latency compared to fast finality single shard coins like Algorand. Their mainnet is live but won't have smart contracts until a claimed September so then we can start to see what it can actually do, is it just another very high TPS transaction with much lower smart contract TPS like Avalanche or Hashgraph?

Algorand has plans for co-chains that are are somewhat similar to sharding and will be interesting to see Algorand's cross co-chains latency. Also there is talk on their official telegram about a sizable upcoming increase in TPS from their current 1k, which includes TEAL layer 1 smart contracts and native assets whereas other coins often have a high TPS for only simple transfers.

Every wallet automatically earns staking rewards as long as they have at least 1 Algo; you do not have to actively do anything to earn rewards.

If you do want to participate in the consensus-making protocol, you need to run a participation node, generate a limited-duration participation key, and then publish that key by ""going online"". Further information can be found on the [Algorand developer website](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/creating-new-account-and-participation-key).

Actively participating does not provide any additional rewards, but does contribute to the health of the chain.

samlapoint,,," It's certainly possible that ALGO reaches several dollars in the near future but the second part of your prediction is just silly. Honestly, it's a red flag that reveals that you're new to the space and have a lot to learn. You also need to realize that even if there was a global economic collapse and people rushed into cryptocurrencies out of fear, they would be rushing into state backed CBDC's, stable-coins, and-or Bitcoin, not ALGO. I hope you understand that economies can't function properly with insane volatility.   


I could go on but I'm just going to refer to what the Algorand team themselves have said regarding how the Algorand Foundation plans to handle things. In short, they will manage it much-like a traditional company handles a stock. 

The Algorand Foundation plans a **slow and steady** rise and will **counterbalance volatility**. That's what true professionals do. This isn't the lottery.   


Please read the Algorand team's post from January about their tokenomics.   


&gt; In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivaled scalability. At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019. During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation. These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. As confirmed by the observation of market returns and volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.   
&gt;  
&gt;The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards. Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.   
&gt;  
&gt;Conditional Vesting   
&gt;  
&gt;The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report. The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.   
&gt;  
&gt;In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

Ok_Negotiation_2974,,,"You raise a solid objection. I will do my best to respond because I understand your frustration. Algo truly brought proof-of-stake from a dream to a reality. 

I find node secrecy to be essential right now within our current framework - while that doesn’t sound like a good thing, I believe it is important. And this is where most people get confused with Bitcoin. (Stay with me for a minute) ... 

Bitcoin, is not private, rather it’s entirely traceable in every way. That’s the beauty of it. We all have access to the guts of the network. We can prop up many things to support its existence, but keeping your engagement with it will never be private. So this is where products like zCash are truly unique to the topic of privatization. 

I think you may be getting stuck on where Algo looks to tackle the topics of “permissionless” and “decentralization” and “democratization.” I believe Algo attempts to solve these issues in layer 1 related to their ‘rekeying’ principles which seeks to allow a user to change their private key but always retain their public address. This allows you and I to not have to change who we are on two-levels every time we send goofy tokens to each other.

Back to the nodes ... in principle, we hate and need nodes to be private in the Algo network because it secures the underlying strategy of Algo which is to keep transactions private. A permissionless network allows by its rules to allow anyone to join without friction, and validates transactions within its user base only. In order to do the same at the node level, node privacy is paramount in order to protect users at the transaction level. In essence, we are protected, private and decentralized at peer-to-peer transaction level through Algo’s rekeying stack ... and we are protected, private and decentralized at the node level too because by nature the nodes are validated by the pure fact that a transaction is validated rather than rejected.

This offers decentrality for the individual running the node and for the network of users. 

I’m not certain that democracy is the goal of a permissionless network, rather privacy is, nor is it the goal of algorand nor is democratization a requirement to claim ‘decentrality.’ For example, let’s say I purchase a chicken from you. I may want to know certain things about said chicken before the purchase, like, how big was the rooster that smashed the hen that laid the egg that became the chicken I’m going to buy .... if I purchase with say a token like VeChain, I’m going to be able to track just about everything that went into that chicken before I buy it and you are going to know who the person is that ends up with your chicken. But if I leverage Algo, our fiscal interaction is entirely private, the transaction authentication is entirely private and we trust this to be so because the network architecture is built to keep all layers not only private but autonomously operative and free from 3rd party eyes.

And this is exactly why Algo is beautiful. In a centralized fiscal policy we can trace all levels of interaction and you can show up at my door and ask for your chicken back. But you can also protect your chicken source or business practices and not have me show up at your door because I want to know where the chicken came from.

Trust is the core principle behind Algo. It is permissionless in that anyone can join and deploy, it is democratic in that the transaction is visible while the rekeying layer secures privacy, and it is decentralized in that the users and nodes confirm true interaction while not relying on third party authentication - its open, while closed framework makes this so.

Message me offline - I’m certain there is a way to deploy a node if you are interested but consider this ... if you had to be taught how to do it, by nature you would already lose a sliver of your privacy in order to be shown how to do it.

I think their claims remain true within their fiscal framework.

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

rjmcoin,,,"Cardano is a force in the entire industry.

Considering the vast majority of the legitimate science and research in this industry is open source, anyone can adopt any tech at any time.  What's going to be the difference maker is the relationships and that's where Cardano is overwhelmingly ahead. 

That said, anyone is free to adopt the technology Cardano has spent many millions of dollars to produce. The only problem is that in order to make a change, you would have to demonstrate that you better understand the tech in a way that your proposal is actually better than Cardano.  If not, then why not just use Cardano? Conversely if Algorand produces groundbreaking science, Cardano will adopt it if it improves the project.  IOHK would be relieved to have someone else do the heavy lifting for once, the science and research path is quite expensive.

Better tech can come along as it should, but a project that is structured in a way to be agile and adopt new ideas and approaches without having to hard fork is formidable long term.

CH is constantly criticized for traveling but he is obviously doing the hard work that will propel Cardano to the future despite any Libra or Amazon or Google ventures that come along. They will instead only propel Cardano's efforts.

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

I replied to someone earlier about pros and cons of the wallet as well with a couple other points, have a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/lf9pbp/just_got_into_algo/gml120k?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) if you want a little more info.

bigjohnston111,,,"Serious issues with this article. Who writes this stuff? Either they don’t understand or they are purposefully misleading. Where do we begin?

1. “The platform chooses the token holders irrespective of the size of their stake.” - This is patently false if referring to Algorand. I won’t even put it in my own words. Algorand clearly explains this. 

“What makes this protocol pure proof-of-stake is the fact that users are chosen to participate in the protocol based on the stake (number of algos) that they have. The VRF behaves similarly to a weighted lottery; it is as if every algo in an account gets its own lottery ticket. The more algos in an online account, the better chance the account has of being selected to participate.”

[See: Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/what-we-do/technology/protocol-overview)

2. “Algorand can offer an alternative to other platforms such as Ethereum and EOS in the DeFi space.” - Makes a statement of offering an alternative but fails to explain why.

3. “Algorand has several features that make it stand apart from other platforms in the market.” - states several features, does not name anything after the sentence then offers it at the end of the article. 

4. “The platform promises and delivers speed, security, and decentralization.” - does not deliver decentralization if the backbone of the network is incentivized only for a select (i.e., centralized) group. Not many people open and run a business to lose money. Non-profits even need operational expenses. To think that  thousands of relay node operators will donate their time, effort, and resources to run the network is absurd. If that’s the case, do not reward the current reward earning relay node operators and find out where this will lead.

5. “ Algorand has another advantage over other DeFi platforms: creating and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications on Algorand is cheaper than other platforms.” - what empirical data is referenced to support this statement?

6. “Compared to other blockchains in the DeFi and smart contract space, The Algorand platform has lower costs for creating, deploying, and running smart contracts and decentralized applications.” - Where is the empirical data to support the position? What data/study is being referenced?

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part of these groups.",True,0,1566158962,,False,0,exct5it,t3_cpgh9o,t3_cpgh9o,1574434894.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/cpgh9o/coinbase_listing/exct5it/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Let me elaborate on the 'right thing' part, I believe Algorand is one of the new breed of blockchain first companies that will result in a series of companies opening up their internal economy by issuing tokens that act both as currency, gas, stock and more.

Algorand's valuation is akin to valuing a company(their business plan, tech and people behind it) + valuing the token as a tradable asset. The market cap may look to be overvalued at the moment, especially considering the rapid inflation from $3.025 billion to $10 billion within 5 years, but, we know that we have entered a bull market with BTC aiming for $10k, we don't know how long it would last.

Comparing to Cardano's market cap of $2.35 billion, Algorand is $7.5 billion considering their 3.025 billion tokens. Algorand already has a working staking protocol that is paying out interest to every address that holds algos. Cardano's shelly isn't released yet, only the testnet is being talked about right now.

Additionally, looking at Slack\[NYSE:WORK\] went IPO and the market cap as of now is $21 billion; I believe we are still in the stages of valuing the blockchain first companies and the token itself and Algorand's valuation between $3-7 billion at this stage does not surprise me.",True,0,1561142517,,False,0,erqg1pf,t3_c17szn,t1_erq79a1,1570476432.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c17szn/is_ada_going_to_win_against_algorand/erqg1pf/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1284768643.0,t2_4cqmz,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

That is from the official website but doesn’t massively clear up the methodology for me... also interestingly I was under the impression that only 1-1.5bio had been put into circulation so far (coinbase data), but according to Algorand that figure is above 3.5bio of which (as you say) 2.3bio is currently being staked.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"Algorand tokens have lost 93% from auction if $2.50 per token is starting price and $0.17 is the low.  All of this in \*just 3 months.\*  It's pretty devastating for auction buyers.  Their tokenomics have been f\*cked from origin which is why I didn't invest despite being interested in their tech (which looks legit).  Knowing there are 10B total tokens to be released, I'd be interested in buying at 100M to 500M market cap which prices coins at $0.01 to $0.05 per token.  These figures are derived from current market cycle/prices/market cap rank.  If each token were only 1 cent, they'd still rank in the top 50 projects as defined by market cap (total supply of 10B tokens x $0.01 = 100M market cap).

As we know, alts move as one big ship currently and so if the whole space pumps or tanks in coming months, it's likely Algorand will follow.  I do think there is a decent chance that Algorand will end up in the top 50 assuming they are able to keep iterating on their tech and improve tokenomics.

As of now internal nodes with massive supply have been offloading staked earnings to bagholders.  [They admit to this here.](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019/)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities, and other research institutions volunteered to support the network    prior to launch....*

*For   their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network. The total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on  average....*

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to selling pressure in the secondary market.""*

Tl;dr:   Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously. These groups have a 99% share of the tokens (so even if they can't sell their special tokens which run the network, their staking reward tokens far outweigh the current circulating/traded supply, and they CAN sell THESE tokens).  And thus, the heavily tokenized internal nodes started cashing out their \*staking rewards\* which has created the immense selling pressure responsible for burying early retail investors.

It's a bit embarrassing how ham-handed they handled the ICO.

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out. I imagine that any node can be kicked out and replaced by Government or Nation state nodes then if ordered to.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

Ok_Negotiation_2974,,,"You raise a solid objection. I will do my best to respond because I understand your frustration. Algo truly brought proof-of-stake from a dream to a reality. 

I find node secrecy to be essential right now within our current framework - while that doesn’t sound like a good thing, I believe it is important. And this is where most people get confused with Bitcoin. (Stay with me for a minute) ... 

Bitcoin, is not private, rather it’s entirely traceable in every way. That’s the beauty of it. We all have access to the guts of the network. We can prop up many things to support its existence, but keeping your engagement with it will never be private. So this is where products like zCash are truly unique to the topic of privatization. 

I think you may be getting stuck on where Algo looks to tackle the topics of “permissionless” and “decentralization” and “democratization.” I believe Algo attempts to solve these issues in layer 1 related to their ‘rekeying’ principles which seeks to allow a user to change their private key but always retain their public address. This allows you and I to not have to change who we are on two-levels every time we send goofy tokens to each other.

Back to the nodes ... in principle, we hate and need nodes to be private in the Algo network because it secures the underlying strategy of Algo which is to keep transactions private. A permissionless network allows by its rules to allow anyone to join without friction, and validates transactions within its user base only. In order to do the same at the node level, node privacy is paramount in order to protect users at the transaction level. In essence, we are protected, private and decentralized at peer-to-peer transaction level through Algo’s rekeying stack ... and we are protected, private and decentralized at the node level too because by nature the nodes are validated by the pure fact that a transaction is validated rather than rejected.

This offers decentrality for the individual running the node and for the network of users. 

I’m not certain that democracy is the goal of a permissionless network, rather privacy is, nor is it the goal of algorand nor is democratization a requirement to claim ‘decentrality.’ For example, let’s say I purchase a chicken from you. I may want to know certain things about said chicken before the purchase, like, how big was the rooster that smashed the hen that laid the egg that became the chicken I’m going to buy .... if I purchase with say a token like VeChain, I’m going to be able to track just about everything that went into that chicken before I buy it and you are going to know who the person is that ends up with your chicken. But if I leverage Algo, our fiscal interaction is entirely private, the transaction authentication is entirely private and we trust this to be so because the network architecture is built to keep all layers not only private but autonomously operative and free from 3rd party eyes.

And this is exactly why Algo is beautiful. In a centralized fiscal policy we can trace all levels of interaction and you can show up at my door and ask for your chicken back. But you can also protect your chicken source or business practices and not have me show up at your door because I want to know where the chicken came from.

Trust is the core principle behind Algo. It is permissionless in that anyone can join and deploy, it is democratic in that the transaction is visible while the rekeying layer secures privacy, and it is decentralized in that the users and nodes confirm true interaction while not relying on third party authentication - its open, while closed framework makes this so.

Message me offline - I’m certain there is a way to deploy a node if you are interested but consider this ... if you had to be taught how to do it, by nature you would already lose a sliver of your privacy in order to be shown how to do it.

I think their claims remain true within their fiscal framework. And I don’t believe Algo is intending to be ‘democratic’ in the same way that other chains are attempting to do.",True,0,1610064336,,False,0,gihh553,t3_ksasco,t1_gih9czv,1620662796.0,0,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/ksasco/serious_lack_of_transparency/gihh553/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,,t2_8yz3d7d1,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,,,[],,,False,[],,,,,

samlapoint,,," It's certainly possible that ALGO reaches several dollars in the near future but the second part of your prediction is just silly. Honestly, it's a red flag that reveals that you're new to the space and have a lot to learn. You also need to realize that even if there was a global economic collapse and people rushed into cryptocurrencies out of fear, they would be rushing into state backed CBDC's, stable-coins, and-or Bitcoin, not ALGO. I hope you understand that economies can't function properly with insane volatility.   


I could go on but I'm just going to refer to what the Algorand team themselves have said regarding how the Algorand Foundation plans to handle things. In short, they will manage it much-like a traditional company handles a stock. 

The Algorand Foundation plans a **slow and steady** rise and will **counterbalance volatility**. That's what true professionals do. This isn't the lottery.   


Please read the Algorand team's post from January about their tokenomics.   


&gt; In mid-November the Algorand Foundation released a major technological upgrade, aimed at making Algorand the most efficient platform for Decentralized Finance applications. New features include Algorand Standard Assets, making tokenization easy and safe, Multiparty Atomic Transfers that can be executed in a single transaction, and Algorand Smart Contracts allowing the developments of applications with unrivaled scalability. At the same time, the Algorand Foundation, in consultation with our community, has revised the economics of the Algo market to foster stability and steady growth. Under the guidance of the Economic Advisory Committee (EAC), the Foundation has:   
&gt;  
&gt;1. Supported temporary suspension of the distribution of Algos going to the early backers performing the role of Node Runners. The suspension came into effect on September 27, 2019. During the suspension, the Foundation agreed with the Node Runners on a new distribution plan that, in 2020, will release a minimum of 3% of the tokens allocated to the Node Runners, instead of the originally planned 50%.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Reduced the Foundation's own selling plans for 2019 and 2020 from around 1 Billion Algos to a maximum of 150 Million Algos.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. Halved the speed of distribution of the participation rewards that go evenly to all Algo holders to reflect the significantly reduced token supply. The distribution will go down from an annual quantity that amounted to almost 20% of the circulating supply in 2019 to a percentage just under 10% in 2020, reducing inflation. These three measures address the excessive supply issue that the EAC pointed out in the State of the Economy Report from November 2019. The supply issue, coupled with some features of the inaugural auction, led to a disruptive price fall for a few months after the inaugural auction. As confirmed by the observation of market returns and volatility in the last quarter of 2019, the fall stopped and became a more stable, less volatile market.   
&gt;  
&gt;The above measures mean for 2020 a reduction of Node Runner distribution (potentially by more than 90%), a reduction of Foundation selling by more than 80%, and a halving of the distribution of participation rewards. Taken together, these changes represent a prudent economic reform, vigorously addressing supply and distribution issues.   
&gt;  
&gt;Conditional Vesting   
&gt;  
&gt;The oversupply from Node Runners vesting and its impact on the Algo market was the focus of the previous State of the Economy report. The new vesting agreement includes drastic cuts in the vesting rate, hence it is expected to have a major impact on the Algo market. Specifically, 3.2M Algos were vested daily during the summer, exerting a powerful downward pressure (even if only a percentage reached the market). In contrast, only 205K Algos will be vested daily under the base rate in the new agreement during 2020. This distribution rate is only accelerated when the Algo price increases, specifically if a moving average of the Algo price rises above the previous high reached since the beginning of the new agreement. The rise in the price is an indication of an increase in demand, which in turn suggests that the market is able to absorb an increase in supply.   
&gt;  
&gt;The new agreement therefore creates an incentive for Node Runners to hold Algos and support the market to obtain steady growth. Moreover, backers that sell their vested Algos (despite the incentive to hold) have a stabilizing effect on the currency, since dropping price will revert the vesting back to its base low rate.   
&gt;  
&gt;In return for this significant vesting delay, an additional 25% reward is allocated to Node Runners. This is done without altering the total Algo supply, as the Foundation sales amount has been reduced by an equivalent figure. This 25% will not undermine the effectiveness of the new vesting plan, since under the base vesting schedule these additional Algos will be vested only in 5 years from now, when circulating supply will be much larger than it is now, making this vesting plan harmonic with the evolution of market circulating amount.

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

Naki111,,,"I'm assuming 1 to 2 dollars for a few reasons.


The main being what people keep overlooking is the staking and participation rewards.


Between them they total 4.25 billion algos those rewards are distributed to holders for staking etc over 5 years at quite a decent rate the earlier in the more rewards received.


So first auction is 25 million plus you have algorands 2.5 billion which won't be sold but is used to secure the network as it gets distributed so you can't really count the 2.5 billion into circulation.

Every month roughly 50 million enters circulation more counting rewards etc but the rewards aren't sold there given to current holders for staking or participating network. 

So in 5 years 3 billion is sold but 4.2 billion is accumulated in staking rewards by holders so a token bought day 1 would give you I'd assume 2.5 tokens if held 5 years.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part of these groups.",True,0,1566158962,,False,0,exct5it,t3_cpgh9o,t3_cpgh9o,1574434894.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/cpgh9o/coinbase_listing/exct5it/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

BrandolarSandervar,,,"For me I basically take everything right out of CoinBase almost immediately and only keep what I intend to sell on CoinBase. As far as I'm concerned the biggest and most important issue with keeping things in CoinBase is the long term security of your money. 

CoinBase's wallet is a custodial wallet, that means it doesn't actually fully belong to you and you do not have access to the private keys. At any moment CoinBase can decide to freeze your assets or not allow you to move/convert them. This kind of defeats the point for me and has me worried to keep things there for too long. I've seen people waiting a very very long time to have CoinBase support even reply to them or fix their issue, have a look on /r/CoinBase. Some are probably fake scammers but I'm sure some are genuine. I don't mind using their service but I'm too paranoid to leave anything sizable on there for long just in case. I'm sure the chances are small but that would be devastating.

They're not too bad to use but basically for your own security keep them in a wallet that's fully under your own control where you can guarantee its safe. Algorand official or Exodus wallet are great choices. You'll get an extra 1% stake reward since CoinBase claims 1% of your rewards.

I replied to someone earlier about pros and cons of the wallet as well with a couple other points, have a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/lf9pbp/just_got_into_algo/gml120k?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) if you want a little more info.

The $2.50 auction price was indeed ridiculous with a market cap of $25 billion for the 10 billion Algos. The current $3.4 billion market cap is actually pretty reasonable considering the promise of the technology.

The Algorand Telegram channel has a good community but yeah not for price discussion.

Of all of the issues you mentioned, none is about the technology or promise that Aglo has. Indeed they have made some serious business mistakes:
1 - Should not have given a buyback guarantee on the auction as that removed much of the risk of buying, thereby creating an artificially high price. And people who bought at the high price on exchanges can't get the buyback, yes rekting early adopters is bad for community building.
2 - Relay node rewards too high creating downward price pressure from selling. Though they are talking about reducing the daily node relay rewards distribution from 2 years to 5 years to reduce the daily node rewards percentage of the available coins, which is also going down over time due to staking rewards.
3 - Rushing into their 200 million super rewards program to only find out later that they need to KYC and block US/China/Canada, etc.  Another unforced error hurting early adopters.

The technology is strong and that is what ultimately will make or break Alogrand. They hopefully won't make additional business mistakes and  I agree increasing the regular staking rewards that don't require KYC would be a great move, as well as burning tokens.",True,0,1568816493,,False,0,f0oogcs,t3_d4y9tz,t1_f0mlpaa,1577149598.0,2,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/d4y9tz/whatll_happen_to_algo_in_next_two_years/f0oogcs/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1497962268.0,t2_4ma6lzt,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,False,,,,,,

But the ICO looks like a scam:
- We don’t want to choose the price of our token like ICO use to work but let user chose the fair price using Deutsh Auction (bit we have a reserve price under which we won’t sale !!!!) 
- We have 10 billion token to offer but we sell only 25 millions in order to make the price of the auction rise !
- And it look like a ponzy they say if you aren’t happy with your token they will buy it back in one year for 90% of the purchase price ! And still people prefer to sell it on exchanges with a 65% lost instead of 10% in 1 years and wait if the price rise ? The mechanism of bying sound very dodgy ! 

Or people are silly and prefer to loose 65% instead of use the buy back in 1 year and lose only 10%
Or the team is selling tons of token to make money on the exchanges
Or people don’t trust they will buy back and try to escape !

Estabelecidos para oferecer uma oportunidade para alunos e professores ingressarem na comunidade Algorand, participarem da inovação disruptiva e contribuírem para a nova economia do conhecimento sem fronteiras, os membros fundadores compartilham a visão da Fundação Algorand sobre o potencial do blockchain como uma força para a justiça social e global. Boa.
Os membros fundadores do programa universitário da Fundação Algorand incluem:
Università della Svizzera Italiana
Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts
Universidade de Pequim
Universidade Sapienza de Roma
Stony Brook University
Universidade de Tel Aviv
Universidade de Tsinghua
Universidade da California, Berkeley
Universidade de Salerno
Universidade de Waterloo
Especificamente, os Membros Fundadores estarão envolvidos na sugestão de esforços de pesquisa técnica e no apoio à plataforma descentralizada do Algorand. Cada instituição terá um representante do programa que trabalhará em estreita colaboração com a Fundação. Como consultores, os representantes do programa também trabalharão para identificar áreas de potencial desenvolvimento e inovação em blockchain e criptografia.
""Estou muito feliz por o MIT ter se juntado à Fundação Algorand e a uma rede altamente respeitada de instituições inaugurais conhecidas por sua excelência em pesquisa e inovação técnica"", disse Ronitt Rubinfeld, do MIT. “Estamos entusiasmados com a promessa global da tecnologia blockchain que a Algorand cumpre e esperamos trabalhar diretamente com a fundação para ajudar a apoiar sua missão geral”.
“Como uma comunidade profundamente enraizada na academia, estamos empolgados por trabalhar com algumas das universidades mais proeminentes de todo o mundo”, disse Tal Rabin, chefe de pesquisa da Fundação Algorand. “Este é realmente um nível de suporte sem precedentes para uma plataforma blockchain fundamental antes do lançamento. Ele fala da qualidade incomparável da tecnologia e do poder de nossa missão ”.
Este programa chega em um momento crítico em que os benefícios do blockchain para democratizar questões sociais importantes - como a desigualdade de nosso sistema financeiro e a desconfiança geral nos sistemas econômicos de hoje - estão sendo reconhecidos como uma maneira de alavancar o blockchain para o bem social. A Fundação Algorand reconhece que os estudantes e o corpo docente das universidades estão no coração de impulsionar a inovação e a mudança, e espera trabalhar para construir o programa à medida que a rede for lançada e começar a crescer.",True,0,1561171721,,False,0,errio4l,t3_c39k8c,t3_c39k8c,1570548687.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/c39k8c/10x_leverage_for_algo_coin_coming_up_tomorrow_are/errio4l/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1546549728.0,t2_2x27y9pp,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

janus94523,,,"1. Can you name another coin that lost roughly 90% of its value in 1.5 months? Bitconnect didn’t even do that bad! 

2. If it goes that low all of crypto crashed, no. Is it possible that Algorand fails? Yes. Here’s why:

 A. Failed Dutch auction. Optics are not good. No one wants to participate in an auction only to lose 90% of the value they bought it at. Oh wait there is a 90% return policy, ok so my money is locked up then for a full year. Oh if I cash out early I get 85% if it back, do I lose 15%. Great, not. Oh wait, that doesn’t apply to relay nodes cause that will cause an issue with the network.

B. Cancelled second auction, it was cancelled because that was going to be a MASSIVE failure!

C. Second (cancelled) auction funds to be used for Super Staking Rewards. You sign up only to learn that KYC is required for staking? Oh and after you’ve secured your spot, you find out that your country is not eligible. A rewards program not executed very well,

D. HORRIBLE Tokeneconomics. Obviously done by some PhD who has never participated in crypto. They might as well draw up the plays for the L.A. Lakers withoutcwatching a single game, knowing players and positions, or their stats.

E. Low levels of developer participation. Have you been in the Algorand forum? Seen the Reddit? Engagement is low. 

F. Retail buyers are unhappy. They’ve been rekt by the above. These were the people you want to keep happy to get others involved. Word if mouth counts. They’ve been so rekt bad references get passed with the Algo name. A good amount have been kicked out of the Telegram. I’m guessing they are not open to criticism. 

G. Ridiculous rewards for relay nodes. The current reward scheme is not justified by traffic or amount of work required. Rewards should be guaranteed with an increasing amount as difficulty, amount of traffic, maintenance, etc are required. Relay node rewards are reserved for a specific group (early nodes) and everyone else later. This smells like a scam type of premine except that it is in reward form. It also smells of centralization as there is a whitelist for nodes and underperforming nodes can be kicked out.

H. Word of mouth, yes again, counts. There are plenty of unhappy people for the absolutely poor execution that has occurred. No doubt that the protocol is fast and finality is instant and s game changer. PGP was a game changer as well but where is it now? What I’m saying is you can be the best but if people don’t know about you, you may not get wide acceptance. Even worse, if you have a bad reputation, there is no amount of exciting features that can bring burned advocates back into the fold.

My suggestion is that Algorand burn at least 75% of the ridiculous amounts of coins out there &amp; reward all Algo holders including those in “ineligible” jurisdictions through increased staking rewards for early adopters and not some shady scheme that limits rewards to a select group. Ridiculous amounts because it’s 10B coins with at least 6 decimal places behind each.

DamonAndTheSea,,,"The Coinbase effect was important in 2017 when fiat on-ramps were constrained and speculative pressure incentived retail investors to buy just about anything via a credit card.  The environment is different now. 

I've been interested in this project but bothered by their tokenomics and distribution which is different than competing POS platforms.  Their Dutch Auction selling 25M tokens at roughly $2.40 turned out to be a big loser for early investors.  The foundation owns 2.5B and retail investors were allowed to purchase into 1% of current circulating supply.  This differential was problematic from the beginning despite high percentage staking rewards. 

Why did this happen and why did the price drop?

Well Algorand has released a statement explaining exactly what happened.

[In this statement the Algorand team explains the following:](https://algorand.foundation/equilibrium_july2019)

""*In order to maximize the Algorand network’s liveness and security, a  diverse group of initial node runners including investors, universities,  and other research institutions volunteered to support the network  prior to launch. These nodes help boost throughput in the network while  also helping us work responsibly towards our goal of true  decentralization. These groups also help build applications on the  Algorand network and conduct research that furthers the Algorand  protocol and field of cryptography in general.*

*For their  contribution, an initial rewards pool of 2.5B Algos was created to  ensure proper incentive to support early liveness of the network.  The  total number of rewards earned by node runners is 3.2M daily on average.  More than 50% of the Algos earned by the node runners are kept online  by their nodes and are participating in the consensus protocol.* 

*It  is important to note that having money online and supporting liveness  of the network is a critical component of the Algorand protocol.  However, some of the tokens earned by node runners have contributed to  selling pressure in the secondary market.*

*In response to this, the  Foundation is considering incentives to increase the number of Algos  held for long-term staking by introducing higher rewards for  participants willing to lock tokens for various lengths of time.* 

*This  will support both the goal of improving secondary market dynamics while  also ensuring that additional tokens continue to come online to support  the protocol and decentralization.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr:  Their select group of special nodes (a federated system; NOT a decentralized system) benefited from the large supply differential.  Their own nodes owned 2.5B tokens and once staking went active, the federated nodes (i.e. 'investors, universities, and other research institutions') started dumping their STAKING rewards on the market causing price to drop precipitously.  An 84% drop in just a month's time.  Record breaking.  These groups have a 99% share of the tokens and started cashing out their rewards at the expense of retail investors.  Bummer for you?  Yeah... but it was dodgey from the beginning.  They didn't think through the incentive balancing.  And the early groups benefited from your hard earned cash.

In response they re-geared the incentives to benefit long term holders as a means to stop the price bleed.  That's fine.. but the $60M raised by ... well... all of you .. that money was put in the pockets of the select early groups running nodes.  If it's unclear, you're not a part of these groups.",True,0,1566158962,,False,0,exct5it,t3_cpgh9o,t3_cpgh9o,1574434894.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,False,/r/algorand/comments/cpgh9o/coinbase_listing/exct5it/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1490266965.0,t2_16ffto,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

dolle,,,"Thanks! Hmm, from skimming [the whitepaper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3132757) it was not my impression that you would first have to stake your funds in order to participate. In particular, this quote (page 2) suggests that no setup which would reveal your intention to participate is necessary:

&gt;Finally, an adversary may target a committee member once that member sends a message in BA⋆.BA⋆mitigates this attack by requiring committee members to speak just once. Thus, once a committee member sends his message (exposing his identity to an adversary),the committee member becomes irrelevant to BA⋆

[An article on Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/no-incentive-algorand-blockchain-sparks-debate-cryptography-event) seems to suggest that there are no mechanisms built in to incentivize the users to stay online. The system is built on the assumption that a majority of the owned funds ""will be online"" for voting because a majority of the users are honest and wish the network to function.

&amp;#x200B;

I am agnostic as to whether built-in incentives are necessary or not, so I think it will be really interesting to see how Algorand pans out. Incentives are certainly not necessary for networks such as BitTorrent, for example, where no user really receives a payoff from seeding, and even has to pay the operational costs of keeping a server online.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not studied Algorand in detail, so the following is me extrapolating from my own mental model of the system. I can, however, see some potential problems here:

(1) Keeping an Algorand node online exposes your funds to more risk because you need the private key to compute the VRF proof that you ""won the lottery"", hence the key must be kept in memory on a publicly exposed machine.

(2) The operational costs of keeping an Algorand node online are probably not comparable to BitTorrent. If your Algorand node runs on a portable device, then it is much more costly (relatively) to keep it online at all times compared to a server in your basement.",True,0,1560969640,,False,0,erkr8vj,t3_c2i5tb,t1_erkai23,1570294305.0,1,False,algorand,t5_3k6uh,,False,,False,,True,/r/algorand/comments/c2i5tb/online_requirements/erkr8vj/,public,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,text,,1194204242.0,t2_312ha,r/algorand,{},False,False,[],False,0.0,[],,[],,,,,,,,,

Hi [**@petew**](https://forum.algorand.org/u/petew).

Answers to your questions below.

Question: What will be the long term incentives for relay nodes?

Answer: The group sometimes referred to as the Relay Node Runners group, came into existence at mainnet launch and should correctly be referred to as Early Backers and Node Runners. This group consists of early investors, commercial entities and non-profits (Universities) who made commitments to support the project and to also run relay nodes to provide the decentralized infrastructure of the blockchain in the early life of the protocol. This group is committed to support the required Relay Node infrastructure of the Algorand blockchain up to 2024. At this point, some of the current participants may decide to discontinue running Relay Nodes. For now, the Foundation has not yet agreed a long term incentive plan to encourage new Relay Node runners to participate, if required, in 2024. The Foundation will engage with the Algorand community, nearer to that date, to evaluate what potential incentive programs are required to onboard new Relay Node Runners. See also technical question below.

Question: There is only a limited amount of relay nodes at the moment maintained by VC’s and some Universities. The Algorand foundation maintains this list, basically making Algorand a permissioned, centralized blockchain. I have read Silivo Micali’s proposal on decentralizing the governance of the Foundation, but nothing about decentralizing the node structure. This means Algorand will at best be a permissioned consortium blockchain like Hashgraph. What is your plan to actually decentralize the technology?

Answer: To clarify, consensus on the Algorand blockchain is run by Participation Nodes, not the Relay Nodes. Participation Nodes on the Algorand network are both public and permissionless. Therefore consensus participation on the Algorand blockchain is public, permissionless and decentralized. While relay nodes do not participate in consensus, having highly reliable relays is critical to the performance of the Algorand blockchain. That is why, currently, the Algorand Foundation maintains the list of relays to ensure relay nodes satisfy the necessary performance requirements and do not slow down the blockchain. As part of our current roadmap, we plan to further the ability to run Relay Nodes on the Algorand Network. One approach being evaluated is to start by using two lists of relays: the current one fully vetted by the Algorand Foundation to keep the network high performance and a second one that is permissionless. Nodes would then connect to relays on both lists allowing best of best world: decentralization + performance. As we move to a permissionless mechanism for Relay Node Running, the Foundation will work with the community to agree an incentive program to support running this infrastructure.

Question: What will be the incentive for staking when the rewards pool runs out in 2030?

Answer: The existing participation rewards program is under community review as part of the discussion around decentralization of governance. Given that this program to bring us to 2030 is not finalized, it is too early to say what the program will be after 2030.

Question: What happens with the money that ends up in the fee sink? Who controls it?

Answer: At the moment, the Algo wallet receiving Algorand blockchain transaction fees is held by the Algorand Foundation. For the near term, the amount of Algo accumulating in this wallet is and will continue to be modest, based on the 0.001Algo/transaction fee. Once the daily transaction level reaches a threshold, where the amount of Algo held in the wallet is material, the Foundation will engage with the community on how best these accumulating fees can be leveraged to support the ecosystem. As it currently stands, Algos in a fee sink can only be sent as participation rewards. A consensus upgrade has the possibility to change this should the community elect to do so.

Question: How will you keep transaction fees low and stable in the long term?

Answer: The Algorand Foundation has no plans to review the transaction fee levels of the Algorand blockchain currently. As the steward of the Algorand ecosystem, the role of the Foundation would be to facilitate the wider Algorand community and ecosystem making that decision, if there is a proposal to examine that, from within the community, at any point in the future.

Question: Why is there only one full stack developer mentioned on the website?

Answer: The ongoing development of layer-1 features of the Algorand protocol is performed by Algorand Inc, under contract to the Algorand Foundation and as such, the teams of developers who build the Algorand layer-1 protocol are in the Algorand Inc. organization.

&gt;If that is the case what is the risk of having an online account -vs- and offline account on a wallet connected to an active node? As Algo is proof of stake I can see why it is beneficial to have many active stakes so I'm a little surprised there seems to be no structural incentive to keep stakes online.

You can actually go online without the secret key on the participation node. Generate the participation key from another location, then move that key over to the participation node. That is more secure: if the participation node is compromised, they still don't have access to the secret key.

This is also a part of the reason that the Algorand Foundation has such a large initial stake that they do not circulate. Until more participants start joining the consensus, they provide some stability and protection against attacks while the chain is young.
