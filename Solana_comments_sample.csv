False,GhettoCryptoz,volunteer,,Dom (Volunteer Mod),"Here‚Äôs my understanding to date, I'm only assisting with community moderation. Not actually part of the team. But here goes: 

In it‚Äôs simplest form Proof of History (PoH) is a clock for blockchain.

However, unlike traditional methods where messages within the network are timestamped. Proof of History is a methodology to prove whether a certain message occurred sometime before or after an event. 

For example ‚Äì when you take a selfie with yourself and a newspaper article in it. You are essentially creating proof that your photograph was taken AFTER the newspaper was published. This is exactly what Proof of History does ‚Äì it enables the network to create a historical record to prove that a specific event occurred at a specific moment of time. You can learn more about PoH here: 

And it can do so in an objective, and decentralised manner. 

What does this mean in layman‚Äôs terms? 
Well this essentially means that nodes downstream can then verify the time and order of events within the network WITHOUT witnessing them directly. 

It‚Äôs important to note that PoH is NOT a consensus protocol. It instead adds valuable data (an objective measure of time) to the blockchain.                                                                                   

By adding this valuable data, it allows Solana to optimize other elements of the system without compromising key features or security. Some of these features include ‚ÄúAvalanche‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of Replication‚Äù, and together they allow Solana to achieve sub-second finality and maintain high throughput with minimal loss in finality time - even after the number of nodes on the network increase substantially. 

* Proof of Replication - To get slightly technical on how PoH allows Solana to optimize Proof of Replication (PoRep) by having a sense of time on the blokckchain, the network then doesn‚Äôt need to re-order the CBC blocks. Traditional systems, have to re-order the blocks because they don‚Äôt have an agreed sense of time, and this process is typically expensive. 
* Avalanche - I won‚Äôt get into the technical details of Avalanche ‚Äì and I‚Äôll let you learn from the master himself (the CTO of Solana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=144s

If you dig through ACTUAL DATA you will see that the APY is at best around 8.25% right now.  That's if you use a 0% commission validator (there aren't many) that gets the best returns.  TBH my validator (Blade Validator) is about the best return validator out there right now and I'm not too shy to say it.  But the difference between the best and middle of the pack is only about 0.5% APY so we're not talking huge differences here.  Your best bet is to spread stake around to give yourself the greatest security and also to help the network by supporting the most validators.

If you are so inclined, you can research the actual APY using the solana command line client.  You can go to solanabeach.io, find a validator, click on it, and then find its largest stake account.  Then you use the solana command line client to query about that stake account and see its recent returns.  That will tell you the APY being achieved by that validator (the APY is the same for all stake accounts staked to a validator; I always pick the largest just because the numbers are biggest and thus least subject to rounding errors).

For example, using my validator:

At solanabeach.io, I click the menu icon in the upper right and switch to Validators view.

Then in the list I see Blade Validator at spot 45.  I click on that to go to a details page for that validator.  Scrolling down to the Delegators list I see the largest Stake Account at the top of the list and click on it.

Now I am on a Stake Account Details page, and I go to the Address and use the copy icon to copy the address.

Then I go to my terminal and use the solana command line client like so to get details of that stake account:

I can see here every epoch for the past 6 epochs and the APY for each epoch.

It's currently at 8.23%.  It went up from 7.74% because I just set my commission to 0% last epoch, it was 8% previously.  So you can see that the difference in returns from an 8% commission validator and a 0% commission validator is about 0.5% APY.  Not a huge difference, but not insignificant either.

You can do the above with any validator, choosing its largest stake account and then using solana stake-account command to find out what kind of APY that validator has been achieving.  Here are some examples for the most recent epoch:

    Chorus One: 7.40% APY
    Everstake: 8.09% APY
    melea.xyz: 8.17% APY
    Forbole: 7.47% APY
    moonlet.io: 7.79% APY

Everstake and melea.xyz are 0% commission validators which is why they are the best APY in this list.  But they're still not as good as my validator.  Why?  Because my validator has 0% commission AND the best vote performance, and vote performance determines overall payout.",True,,0,1617556021,,1617556499.0,0,gtd3voe,False,t3_mjhyrh,False,t1_gtbjmnn,/r/solana/comments/mjhyrh/how_do_i_stake/gtd3voe/,,,5,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 80, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Everything is better with a good hug', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_8352bdff-3e03-4189-8a08-82501dd8f835', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Hugz', 'penny_donate': 0, 'penny_price': 0, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a23bf7f08b633508dedf457f2704c522b94a04', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f2f16e71d2929e3d7275060af3ad6b851dbfb1', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca487311563425e195699a4d7e4c57a98cbfde8b', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b4eedcffb1c09a826e7837532c52979760f1d2b', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d5ab237eb71a9f02bb3bf9ad5ee43741918d6c', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69997ace3ef4ffc099b81d774c2c8f1530602875', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9519d1999ef9dce5c8a9f59369cb92f52d95319', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f076c6434fb2d2f9075991810fd845c40fa73fc6', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85527145e0c4b754306a30df29e584fd16187636', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8843cdf82c3b741d7af057c14076dcd2621e811', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtd3voe,1628409656.0,False

1. Its not their fault or problem that ETH was not scalable and able to handle the amount of transactions that come through the block chain or able to handle the data needed on transactions. Innovation takes trial and error. They tried ETH cause at the time it was the best option, then quickly realized that it was going to work. Didn't screw any ETH supporters, invest in ETH not KIN if thats your priority.
2. The money raised has went to incredible developments. Its not Kin's fault that they got hit with the lawsuit and had to dig themselves out of the whole. I applaud them for not laying down and fighting back at the SEC.
3. They went to stellar cause stellar could handle more transactions than ETH but guess what, they maxed out that block chain too. Their are people and apps sitting on the sidelines right now ready to join in the ecosystem as soon as it can scale so the move to Solana is the only way to make that happen. You say they joined stellar probably just cause they received funding. That's false and if that was true than when Solana pulled their funding they offered to kin, then why is kin still coming over to Solana?

,silverknight781,,,,"Jay thank you so much for your explanation here and later in this thread, it's rare to find real finance people willing to explain to us noobs. 

I have being doing DD on Solana for weeks and finally got in around $3.50, in for the long term. Admittedly I am a little worried I'm getting in at fully diluted mc of close to $2b but honestly I think it can be much more even. 

A few questions if you'll entertain:
1) when dilution comes (80-90% by eoy?) How does it come on the market? Will they release in a way that takes into account the price action so as to not destroy the technicals, or is it a regular trickling release, or released but locked for certain time, etc? Would like to learn about the mechanics and thinking behind token releases. 

1.1) on August 14, 2020 the MC doubled, is that due to a release in coins? Is there anywhere to check for how/why the MC calculation changed, so one can see record of releases in the past? To an noob, it's weird to see a coins mc go up but price flat. Would also love to learn about thinking behind releasing coins gradually for new tokens as well. 

2) on the tech side, what are some other L1 solutions you think has promise? I have been looking around and honestly cannot find anyone even close to SOL's credibility. 

Thank you so much.

,GhettoCryptoz,volunteer,,Dom (Volunteer Mod),"Hey u/ABCBAA!  


The cryptographic timestamps take real time to generate and are pre-image resistant. Meaning that the output of the latest SHA256 hash, is used to generate the next hash. Essentially forming a sequential hash chain that can't be faked. 

Transactions and votes are then appended within these hashes to mark an instance in time of when they occurred. In a way, this helps us cheat the two general problems by allowing nodes to **optimistically** progress before consensus. 

Then during the consensus process that follows - the system/nodes then checks the validity of these transactions/messages by having nodes on the network vote on the ledger each block (every 400ms) for what they believe to be the accurate version of the ledger based on the data they receive from the network. 

We call our consensus mechanism Tower BFT (you can read more on this here:  [https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79](https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79) ).

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree.  The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0% commission, like Everstake.

I also agree that no-commission validation is not sustainable.  These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base.  I don't quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though, given that they've attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere. 

I run a validator and I have 8% commission which I think is pretty close to the average.

Within a given commission range, you can also look at the total number of votes being cast, since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting.  Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible, then the overall take will be as large as possible (but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers).

On validators.app, you can see this in the ""Skipped Vote % (distance from leader)"" metric.  The closer to 0, the better (so -0.40% is better than -1.0%), because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer.

So basically there are two factors: how close to optimally the validator is voting (represented by very small skipped vote %) and what commission the validator is taking.  Of the two, unless the skipped vote % is very high, the commission will make the larger difference.

My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0.25% of the very best (represented by values like -0.24% on validators.app).  But I charge 8% commission.

Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network - it makes it more centralized and reduces its security.  So if you want to do what's best for Solana itself, you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators.  Maybe something like 3/4 of your stake on big low-fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators?

That's what I did when I started.  I picked 6 - two in the top 10, two in the 10 - 30 range, and two in the 30 - 100 range (in total stake ranking).  I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission.

Parachain leases will only be used by the very large players (such as exchanges) to eliminate gas fees, everyone else will be using parathreads that pay gas fees.  Gavin Wood reckons this was a massive problem in Ethereum because they have a ""one model fits all"" ethos and large players pay far too much for usage.  The theory is large players will be prepared to pay in opportunity cost to hire a parachain which is proportional to the money they can save by not paying gas fees.  Free market economics would suggest this should happen but the maths is not trivial to me.  The thing about Polkadot is that if this doesn't work the DOT holders will just vote to change it.  Solana's governance means it's not up to the tokenholders and there is no plan to allow them voting rights (correct me if I'm wrong) even on the tokenonics which is likely to lead to market imbalanced like on Ethereum - you can't top manage this stuff.  This is my biggest issue with Solana and the only reason I am not currently invested.  However adding EVM support would be a massive plus.  It could be that Solana lives along side Polkadot due to it's huge throughput and Polkadot never implement anything that fast but it seems pretty unlikely to me.

I think the user base is fluid. To me, moving chains is not like leaving Facebook to \[insert social media site here\], where if you move to another network - you potentially lose the value of the network = your connections / friends.

While applications would need to be reprogrammed, from a user perspective... if I  can earn 200% staking on SOL and 200% staking on ETH - what value does the application on ETH provide? And to address the real issue, if I earn 200% and then burn my gains to cover ETH gas fees, what real value is created?

Have you looked at and can you read a chart..look at the volumes being traded as the price continues to decline. Have you never seen that before anywhere?  Stellar XLM Lumens never felt a ripple when they onboarded  KIN. I expected we would enjoy enhanced liquidity  and some price appreciation because of the XLM  Dev Team and its network...You know how that worked out don't you? The average KIN holder has more  KIN Tokens than the whole of the SOLANA network (ok thats not true) Quite a few of Kin Holders have Double/Triple/Quadruple the amount of tokens of the entire Solana Network..and if we take the low number of 1.5 Million users a day along with that  Solana may live to choke on the adoption.  500M is a number ripe for market manipulation and I see nothing but trouble ahead for Solana holders
If the volumes being sold do not decline and the price increase then they are in for a roller coaster ride. Kin did nothing for Stellar except clog the network..it will do the same for Solana.

,TangeloNightmare,founder,,Eric (Co-Founder),"Thanks for the question u/Omisebro, I think some of the confusion may just be terminology. Let me try to clarify

&gt;I was intrigued by Solana and it‚Äôs team, but when I read it was using a derivative of DPoS and PBFT I was pretty disappointed. From my understanding PBFT l doesn‚Äôt scale well at all with additional nodes, which means there will need to be white-listed nodes to keep scalability reasonable. Even PoH (while smart and cool) is just an incremental improvement and doesn‚Äôt result in a revolutionary iteration of BFT that solves it‚Äôs inherent terrible scalability with added nodes

Actually PoH does address this side effect of traditional PBFT. It separates the time component from the consensus component. I.e. in traditional PBFT, the network proceeds (time) in a lock-step fashion, each step requiring the network to come to consensus, so the bottleneck, wrt to progression, is the network communication overhead necessary to agree on the ordering of the transactions to come to consensus. This means that more nodes --&gt; more communication --&gt; more time to consensus --&gt; scaling problems. This is, in effect, one of the main drivers of the ""inherent terrible scalability with added nodes"" you refer to (another component is the data propagation component, PoH helps here too and you can read about how [here](https://solana.com/turbine/) if interested).

PoH (i.e. the data structure of the Solana blockchain) provides a cryptographically verifiable sense of ordering to the messages, so nodes that receive the PoH data stream can trust/verify the ordering of the transactions on their own, without the node, and the network, having to put the breaks on transaction processing to wait for the rest of the nodes to agree on an ordering before continuing. So if I'm a Solana node, I can keep processing/validating transactions that are being broadcast from the rotating leaders ""optimistically"", without having the start/stop nature of traditional PBFT.  In the language of the [CAP theorem](https://towardsdatascience.com/cap-theorem-and-distributed-database-management-systems-5c2be977950e), you might say that Solana is an 'availability/liveness' preferring chain, rather than traditional PBFT which leans toward 'consistency'. 

Our consensus mechanism ([TowerBFT](https://solana.com/tower-bft/)), is then layered on top of this - resolving forks that may arise rather than being the limiting factor in network progression.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So it seems from the documentation that stake will be delegated to nodes (how many will be on mainnet? 21?) so these delegators get to choose who is whitelisted? Even then what dies Solana have in place to prevent the alleged cartels that have formed in EOS?

I think this may be where some of the terminology confusion comes in. Perhaps DPOS isn't the correct terminology (has EOS fully appropriated this terminology?).  We allow delegation of stake to validators -  while at the same time our validator network is fully permissionless (in fact, with our incentivized testnet just about to kick off, you should feel free to [spin a validator node up yourself](https://solana-labs.github.io/book-edge/testnet-participation.html)). 

To be clear: there is no whitelist for validators/delegators on our network.  On mainnet, anyone can become a validator, accept delegations, earn rewards, etc.

We've done test of the network, spinning up 200 GPU nodes across multiple regions for benchmarking purposes (50ktps!), but there are no (lower or upper) requirements on the number of mainnet nodes. We expect the number of mainnet nodes to be driven more by the economics of the validation ecosystem :)",True,False,0,1569050646,,False,0,f0xwjo8,False,t3_d6it97,True,t3_d6it97,/r/solana/comments/d6it97/how_does_solana_intend_to_prevent_validator/f0xwjo8/,,1577308424.0,3,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,dark,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Eric (Co-Founder)'}]",richtext,1524159918.0,t2_17wvk126,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,[],0.0,,,,False,,,,,,,

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"It costs SOL to occupy disk space.  You can use the 'solana rent' command to find out how much.

Solana allows every account holding data to maintain a minimum balance to avoid paying any rent on that data, and since most people would choose to keep their minimum balance above the rent level rather than paying rent, let's just focus on that.

Rent is calculated based on the number of bytes that are being stored.

Right now, the rent exempt minimum for 1000 bytes of storage is 0.00785088 SOL, which is currently about 20 US cents.

As you can see, it would be expensive to try to spam data onto the Solana network.  If you tried to spam 1 GB, you'd have to keep a minimum balance of 6960 SOL, which is about $180,000 at current prices.

That is money that you'd have to keep locked up in Solana in a non-interest-bearing account (i.e. not staked), and since Solana has inflation (currently about 8%), you'd actually be losing $14,476 per year plus lost opportunity cost on that money.

This is perhaps more within the realm of feasability of an attacker since 14 grand is not excessive.  However, 1 GB of data isn't going to make much difference to most validators, where the drive size dedicated to the ledger is typically more than 300 GB, often more than 1 TB.

So to really make a difference, try 200 GB.  Now you're gonna have to keep 1392000 SOL locked up to avoid rent, which is $36 million worth, and lose 2.8 million per year on inflation, plus lost opportunity costs.

In terms of the size of transaction storage, transactions are only stored temporarily -- most validators only keep a couple days worth of history.  All that anyone *really* needs is the current verified state, all transactions can continue to proceed just with this minimum information.  I don't know why history is even kept at all, I think it's just because theoretically a fork can last for a while so you'd better have history to be able to go back to the point of a fork when needed, although forks usually only last seconds.  The full history of all Solana transactions is something in the terabytes right now and I think the Solana Foundation is keeping it somewhere, I don't even know why, except for historical interest I guess.",True,,0,1617898097,,1617898286.0,0,gttowt5,False,t3_mmol0v,False,t1_gttkq9c,/r/solana/comments/mmol0v/how_does_solana_react_to_spam_attacks/gttowt5/,,,6,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 500, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Use the Starry Award to highlight comments that deserve to stand out from the crowd.', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'icon_format': 'APNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Starry_512.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_0e957fb0-c8f1-4ba1-a8ef-e1e524b60d7d', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Starry', 'penny_donate': 0, 'penny_price': 0, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Starry_16.png', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Starry_32.png', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Starry_48.png', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Starry_64.png', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Starry_128.png', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bv82snw6r6i51_ShootingStar.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b9b96c6e8522652001b8806723eef42284a213a', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bv82snw6r6i51_ShootingStar.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed31d025864a064edea1e2bcb96f4c0040c0d1d2', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bv82snw6r6i51_ShootingStar.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3e8f9437c877610c7b997f472440d9b92000b9b', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bv82snw6r6i51_ShootingStar.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a8d924ca401f162b4d7a4d9f155bada63477cc5', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bv82snw6r6i51_ShootingStar.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6191433430dbd6fa04a24eeb066a072797b649fb', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/bv82snw6r6i51_ShootingStar.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gttowt5,1628367686.0,False

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"And since you asked, I'm going to give you even more info than you ever wanted to know.

Currently, there are what I consider to be 4 major groups of validators:

(1). The big guns.  This is almost everyone in the top 12 - 15.  These validators have many millions staked to them and usually are quite professional organizations who have made a business of staking.  They are great choices from a reliability standpoint, but many do not offer particularly great commission.  A few offer very low or zero commission, but this will not last (although you might as well take advantage of it while you can right?!).  HOWEVER, these are already the most-staked validators which means that staking to them is kinda bad for the network.  So if you really want to do what is best for Solana you will only stake *some* of your tokens there, and spread the rest lower.

(2). The middle-of-the-pack: these are larger although not nearly as large as the big ones, and they range from like around 300,000 stake through 3 or 4 million stake.  I think that most are still quite well run - they seem to be just as reliable as the largest ones, and I've been waching very closely for a couple of weeks.  There are maybe 20 - 30 validators to pick in this range.   I think that all of them would be a fine choice.  Be aware though that many in the 1.5 - 3.5 million stake range are actually in what I am calling category 3, but these are obvious as category 3 has 100% commission so you would never want to stake with them anyway (as you'd make 0%, and they'd make 100%, off of your stake).

(3). There is some very large whale who appears to be self-staking about 50 million SOL.  It may be a group of whales who got together or something.  Anyway, this is a large group of about 20 validators with 1.5 - 3.5 million SOL staked *each* and a 100% commission.  They don't want your stake.  Don't stake with them.

(4). The Hetzner crowd.  This is a huge number of validators that are almost all located in Hetzner low-cost data centers in Europe.  They are all staked with around 200,000 - 230,000 SOL.  They were staked by the Solana Foundation as part of the program to encourage new validators to start up.  Someone figured out that the cheapest way to do this was to sign up for a 100 Euro monthly plan from Hetzner and start pumping out validators.  I am not saying it's all one person or a small group of people, but I have no doubt that it's a community that together figured out how to run a bunch of validators in Europe for the lowest possible cost.  Literally half of the mainnet validators in existence are these.  I find that they tend to be the least reliable and provide the worst return.  I staked with some of them before I knew much about Solana and they had the worst performance (but still it was only like 1% APY different from my best performance - so not a huge difference -- but you *did* say ""max rewards"", so ...).  As long as the price of SOL stays high, these validators will keep going, but I would imagine that they are the most price-sensitive, because if the price of SOL goes down, they will be the first to become unprofitable and some may stop validating.  I don't know for sure.  All of them I am sure would love to have your stake because they are all competing in a very large pool of over 250 validators with almost no way to differentiate between them.  Also they almost all have high commissions - 10% - which means that because of being overall the least reliable, highest commission, and most concentrated in one data center (Hetzner), they are probably the worst choice for someone looking for ""max value"".

Of course there is a 5th category - small validators with 30,000 or less - some validators having less than 5,000 staked.  I have no idea what these validators are doing since you're almost certainly losing money running a validator at this level of stake.  I wish them luck though ...",True,,0,1616892213,,1616892425.0,0,gsj3jt8,False,t3_meiwg6,False,t1_gshz1dp,/r/solana/comments/meiwg6/choosing_a_validator_for_max_rewards/gsj3jt8/,,,11,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 150, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree.  The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0% commission, like Everstake.

I also agree that no-commission validation is not sustainable.  These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base.  I don't quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though, given that they've attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere. 

I run a validator and I have 8% commission which I think is pretty close to the average.

Within a given commission range, you can also look at the total number of votes being cast, since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting.  Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible, then the overall take will be as large as possible (but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers).

On validators.app, you can see this in the ""Skipped Vote % (distance from leader)"" metric.  The closer to 0, the better (so -0.40% is better than -1.0%), because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer.

So basically there are two factors: how close to optimally the validator is voting (represented by very small skipped vote %) and what commission the validator is taking.  Of the two, unless the skipped vote % is very high, the commission will make the larger difference.

My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0.25% of the very best (represented by values like -0.24% on validators.app).  But I charge 8% commission.

Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network - it makes it more centralized and reduces its security.  So if you want to do what's best for Solana itself, you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators.  Maybe something like 3/4 of your stake on big low-fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators?

That's what I did when I started.  I picked 6 - two in the top 10, two in the 10 - 30 range, and two in the 30 - 100 range (in total stake ranking).  I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission.

,SolanaLabs,,,,"Hey! Happy to help explain. Solana is a PoS network that uses an innovation called 'Proof of History' before consensus to reach speeds of 50,000 tps +. Proof of History (PoH) is a globally-available, permissionless source of time in the network that works before consensus. POH is not a consensus protocol or anti-Sybil mechanism. Rather, POH is a solution to the clock problem.

Whereas other blockchains require validators to talk to one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF)

There are a total of 8 core innovations that allow the Solana network to operate at such speeds with sub-second confirmation times: [https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda)",True,False,0,1600974466,,False,0,g6ge2zy,False,t3_iz2l0q,False,t3_iz2l0q,/r/solana/comments/iz2l0q/solanas_consensus_algorithm/g6ge2zy/,,1613243462.0,6,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,,t2_48o4a4e8,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

We're also considering to add a WUSDT-to-USDT converter directly into 'Swap' so everyone can simply select the two assets and swap to convert.

The new RAY-USDT pool will go live in approx 24 hrs. Make sure to cancel any open RAY-WUSDT orders you have on the trading DEX page before that.

Proof of History (PoH) is a globally-available, permissionless source of time in the network that works before consensus. POH is not a consensus protocol or anti-Sybil mechanism. Rather, POH is a solution to the clock problem.

Whereas other blockchains require validators to talk to one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF)

You're able to start up a node on the mainnet, but unless you'd been doing it for a while or had acquired a large amount of SOL, I don't see a realistic way in if you're an individual in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.

I thought about this as well and am mulling it over. Not a bad idea at all. If I recall I think you can get on their testnet to get familiar with it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think part of the reason that people are likely hesitant to share, however, is that existing validators do not want competition.

I see this happen alot - people mix things that are true and verifiable, with things that are theoretical and not implemented, and it causes a lot of confusion.

Inflation is implemented and happening right now.  It's around 8% per year, and will reduce a little bit each year, until it hits a constant 1.5% in about 11 years.  Here is all the details on that:

https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/ed_overview/ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_protocol_based_rewards

Slashing - the mechanism for punishing validators who break the rules - is NOT implemented.  It's all theory right now.

The only concrete thing that slashing has been proposed to be used for is for punishing validators who break the voting rules -- the rules are that validators are not supposed to 'switch forks' for a certain amount of time after voting on a fork (if there are two forks and a validator chooses to vote on fork A and not B, then that validator is committed to only voting on fork A for a certain period of time; if the validator wants to switch to fork B because it believes that fork has become the better fork, it must wait to do so but not voting on fork A for a while until it has satisfied the waiting period, then it can switch to voting on fork B; this is to provide the mechanism that forces validators to commit to forks which then allows forks to win or lose; if every validator voted on every fork, then no fork would ever die and there would just be more and more forks).

But there is noting right now preventing a validator from breaking those rules and voting on multiple forks at once.  In fact, validators are kind of economically incentivized to do so because they will be guaranteed to get more votes in, which makes more money.  As far as I know, validators are currently being honest and following the fork voting rules; but if they are doing so, it's just out of honesty.  There is no penalty for being dishonest, because there is no slashing implemented.  (Also, i would take expertise and work to modify the validator code to allow this kind of multi-fork voting, and nobody with the time and expertise has been motivated to do that, as far as I know.)

Then there are nebulous claims that slashing could be implemented to deal with provably malicious validators - for example a validator which can be shown to have tried to consistently cheat with false transactions or something like that, or which has a pattern of creating unnecessary forks so flagrantly that it must be malicious, etc.  The mechanism for this slashing has never been fully explained, just hinted at.  But because deciding on guilt would involve some degree of human judgement, it's hard to see how this would happen without the Solana Foundation just coding the slash directly into the validator code and convincing all the validators to accept that new software that enforces the slash.  The foundation has great power here because most validators will just blindly go along with whatever the foundation says, and will install whatever new version of the validator software the foundation makes.

If this all seems a little unsatisfactory to you, then we're in agreement.  I think the foundation needs to implement a mechanism for automated slashing of validators who violate vote rules.  But I guess this will take some time.

In the meantime, talking about slashing like it exists now, is misleading.",True,,0,1617939209,,1617939557.0,0,gtw4bnz,False,t3_mn27en,False,t1_gtvsl39,/r/solana/comments/mn27en/new_to_solana/gtw4bnz/,,,9,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtw4bnz,1628361439.0,False

Settlement time is by far the lowest and its censorship resistance is much higher than its fairly centralized competitors. It beats all the majors in those categories: XRP, ADA, LTC, BCH, XLM, BSV, EOS, TRX, XTZ, ATOM, NEO, DASH. It could probably handle more TPS than all of them combined, $50B worth.

False,GhettoCryptoz,volunteer,,Dom (Volunteer Mod),"Here‚Äôs my understanding to date, I'm only assisting with community moderation. Not actually part of the team. But here goes: 

In it‚Äôs simplest form Proof of History (PoH) is a clock for blockchain.

However, unlike traditional methods where messages within the network are timestamped. Proof of History is a methodology to prove whether a certain message occurred sometime before or after an event. 

For example ‚Äì when you take a selfie with yourself and a newspaper article in it. You are essentially creating proof that your photograph was taken AFTER the newspaper was published. This is exactly what Proof of History does ‚Äì it enables the network to create a historical record to prove that a specific event occurred at a specific moment of time. You can learn more about PoH here: 

And it can do so in an objective, and decentralised manner. 

What does this mean in layman‚Äôs terms? 
Well this essentially means that nodes downstream can then verify the time and order of events within the network WITHOUT witnessing them directly. 

It‚Äôs important to note that PoH is NOT a consensus protocol. It instead adds valuable data (an objective measure of time) to the blockchain.                                                                                   

By adding this valuable data, it allows Solana to optimize other elements of the system without compromising key features or security. Some of these features include ‚ÄúAvalanche‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of Replication‚Äù, and together they allow Solana to achieve sub-second finality and maintain high throughput with minimal loss in finality time - even after the number of nodes on the network increase substantially. 

* Proof of Replication - To get slightly technical on how PoH allows Solana to optimize Proof of Replication (PoRep) by having a sense of time on the blokckchain, the network then doesn‚Äôt need to re-order the CBC blocks. Traditional systems, have to re-order the blocks because they don‚Äôt have an agreed sense of time, and this process is typically expensive. 
* Avalanche - I won‚Äôt get into the technical details of Avalanche ‚Äì and I‚Äôll let you learn from the master himself (the CTO of Solana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=144s

I believe that there is a threshold of Lamports above which rent does not apply.  I suspect this because they are still building out/maturing the ecosystem and don't want to discourage ownership of SOL.  At some point I expect rent would become more significant.

    $ solana block

will give you info about the current block.

In that you can find the parent slot, and you can then use

    $ solana block &lt;PARENT_SLOT&gt;

I'm not sure what you mean by 'inspect previous epochs'.  An epoch is just a collection of slots (there are 432,000 slots in an epoch), and the commands mentioned will let you look at any previous slot, so you can look at 'previous epochs' that way.

Finally, in terms of fees, the fees haven't changed in a long time if ever, so I don't think looking at historical data would be very interesting.

That page focuses on slashing as a way to enforce the rule that validators are only allowed to vote on one fork for some period of time.  This makes sense because requiring validators to be committed to a fork is the mechanism whereby consensus is created.

However, there is also mention from time to time of more egregious slashing penalties for ""malicious"" validator behavior.  It wasn't made clear in the docs but I'm guessing that this would be done by the 'central authority' who would decide to hard code the slash in code and put it in the next software release.  The validators would then 'vote' for that by taking that version of the software.  Once a majority of validators have done so, the slash is accepted by virtue of being enforced since the slash is now running on the majority of nodes.

This puts a lot of power in the hands of the developers who control the software.  Because I think we can all assume that validators *want* to stay up to date with software releases and so there is *a lot* of inertia built into the system.  Certainly some less than optimal choices by the foundation could be carried through just on that inertia.  This is worrisome.

The comforting part is that the foundation is very motivated to do the right thing, knowing that the entire success of solana depends on validator and end-user mindshare, which would be highly compromised by nefarious actions on the part of the foundation.

In the end I think it's a pipe dream for anyone to think that any of these systems is truly decentralized.

It's why I got super excited about Bitcoin in 2011 but only bought 3 coins once I realized that the entire design is self-limiting in its transaction processing speed which means that it can never serve the purpose that it pretended to serve, which was as an anonymous decentralized form of money.  What I unfortunately did not realize at the time was that the market valuation of Bitcoin was not going to be based on its actual fitness for its supposed purpose, but more on speculation and hype.  Had I realized that I would be a much richer person than I am now :)

Solana gets me excited about cryptocurrency in the way that the original Bitcoin whitepaper did back then, but with Solana I see a system that can actually achieve the transaction speed and cost necessary to actually operate as a currency.  What I do not know is how much hype is necessary to allow Solana to thrive and whether or not that level of hype will be achieved.

There are also many aspects of Solana that I wonder about the technical soundness of, mostly because I do not understand Solana.  There is no clear, comprehensive, and complete white paper like there was for Bitcoin.  I read the Bitcoin whitepaper and could understand everything about it.  With Solana there are bits and pieces of generalized algorithms described but most of the technical details are probably just artifacts of how the code happens to be written.

You will burn those tokens by such and such a date or you will not..you make definitive statements Not weasely syntax leaving ambiguity and outs. Any way SOLANA does not SOLVE KINS LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. It will solve SOLANAS high market price by dragging Solana into the crosshairs of the SEC and providing a litigious future and uncertain outlook for SOL. This will allow all the weakhands to exit gracesfully and leave the bagholders waiting for muh moon launch. If you have made money with SOL be proactive and get out now, you like it so much you can probably buy back later for much much less.

A look into the growing number of projects building on Solana. 

There are now over 120 projects in the Solana ecosystem and counting! To celebrate these milestones, the Solana Foundation will be releasing a bi-weekly ecosystem update highlighting the vast array of projects using the Solana blockchain. Among these projects include unique wallet solutions, decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, staking platforms, digital games, storage solutions, and much more.

,SolanaLabs,,,,"Hey! Happy to help explain. Solana is a PoS network that uses an innovation called 'Proof of History' before consensus to reach speeds of 50,000 tps +. Proof of History (PoH) is a globally-available, permissionless source of time in the network that works before consensus. POH is not a consensus protocol or anti-Sybil mechanism. Rather, POH is a solution to the clock problem.

Whereas other blockchains require validators to talk to one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF)

There are a total of 8 core innovations that allow the Solana network to operate at such speeds with sub-second confirmation times: [https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda)",True,False,0,1600974466,,False,0,g6ge2zy,False,t3_iz2l0q,False,t3_iz2l0q,/r/solana/comments/iz2l0q/solanas_consensus_algorithm/g6ge2zy/,,1613243462.0,6,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,,t2_48o4a4e8,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

False,nossocc,,,,"I think Solana is a very promising project. In my opinion a problem with the crypto space is that a lot of the community and developers are quite new engineers. Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?"" I don't know. But in terms of a long term investment in my opinion Solana is solid, it's just that right now it's probably overvalued like everything else.

They [**announced**](https://medium.com/solana-labs/solana-completes-20-million-raise-led-by-multicoin-capital-3d7f939475b6) the sales as a single Series A in late-July 2019. The fundraising effort ran parallel to Solana's work on the protocol, which went through several permissioned testnet phases before the team announced its public incentivized testnet, called Tour de SOL, in Q3 2020. The first stage of Tour de SOL went live in Feb. 2020, and it continues to run alongside the Mainnet Beta version of Solana today.

* Solanas circulating supply did not include the tokens that were given to a market maker
* Solana burned tokens, but then secretly re-minted them later a few days later when no one was looking
* Solanas consistent refusal to spend the time to build a block explorer... which enabled them to hide that the circulating supply was actually much higher than previously acknowledged.

False,nossocc,,,,"I think Solana is a very promising project. In my opinion a problem with the crypto space is that a lot of the community and developers are quite new engineers. Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?"" I don't know. But in terms of a long term investment in my opinion Solana is solid, it's just that right now it's probably overvalued like everything else.

Tweet thread where CMC committed to making the fix happen: https://twitter.com/zmanian/status/1292642715725832192


You can see on CoinGecko that the circ supply increase was much more gradual. We finally got CMC to commit to timely updates (now in the form of the API endpoint that CoinGecko and¬†explorer.solana.com/supply¬†have used for many months) which we were happy about. But because their historical graph only updates when they update the number, this resulted in a supposed ""spike"" in circ supply.

False,aeyakovenko,founder,,Anatoly (Co-Founder),"\&gt; What about the 50k-65k transactions per sec? [https://solana.com/](https://solana.com/) here you can check that there are like 1000 (1k) transactions per sec as much ... Is this because there are very few transactions using SOL block chain?

1k is the current load, about 50% consensus, 50% other use cases.  500tps steady state use case load is greater then all the other networks combined.  Validators don't need to provision their systems for anything but the current load, but modern day hardware like 5960x AMD chips can do 100ktps in standalone tests.

\&gt; I have tested SOLANA and is incredible fast, I have made 20 transactions already and they take lesst than 10 secs to arrive.

Which wallet are you using?  The ""showing up"" depends on the RPC infra supporting that wallet.  Sollet, which is using the serum public api nodes has the same infra as the traders/market makers using serum and should display the update in 1.2s on average

\&gt; NEXT QUESTION from the last point. If it takes $0.0001 , why does BINNACE chage 0.01 SOL? This doesn't make sense but probably is realted to the bussines practices of BINNACE rather of SOL chain. Fee:0.01 SOL‚âà $0.051648 (02-02-2021)

Binance's omniwallet creates temporary accounts for user deposits and withdrawals, which takes a bit more gas, and they round up to their smallest internal numbers.

\&gt; Another question from the last point. Who provides the HARDWARE to make transactions? As far as I know is what are called LEADERS and then Global Validators. The more LEADERS with better hardware the better the capabilities? Does SOLANA will provide LEADERS of their own? Anyone can be leader? Some of those questions are answered here: [https://solana.com/validators/#signup](https://solana.com/validators/#signup) And you can check the current LEADERS and VALIDATORS here: [https://solanabeach.io/](https://solanabeach.io/)

Network is open and permission less, so anyone can be a validators, there are no min stake requirements like eth2, so once you get staked you get a stake weighted portion of the leader schedule for the epoch.

\&gt; Why isn't SOLANA chain technology more KNOWN? Don't like conspiracy theories, so I will just stick to the fact they have made they biggest announcement about their performance on 20th DEC 2020. And because they weren't very known, I guess newspapers, influencers and professionals of the market hasn't heard about it or just sceptical about the legitimate of their claims.

The effective APR is hard to calculate since it depends on the exact epoch duration which varies.

It seems that Solana has over 1000 tps with it still not yet being mainstream. Ethereum on the other hand caps out at 15 tps. This big difference suggests that the concept of a ‚Äútransaction‚Äù is different in both networks.

To do the entire work of an Eth transaction in Solana, would this require multiple Solana transactions? What is the factor here?

If the Kin foundation would act in similar way then they should be the ones not getting 1% grant but asking for 2% grant.

That page focuses on slashing as a way to enforce the rule that validators are only allowed to vote on one fork for some period of time.  This makes sense because requiring validators to be committed to a fork is the mechanism whereby consensus is created.

However, there is also mention from time to time of more egregious slashing penalties for ""malicious"" validator behavior.  It wasn't made clear in the docs but I'm guessing that this would be done by the 'central authority' who would decide to hard code the slash in code and put it in the next software release.  The validators would then 'vote' for that by taking that version of the software.  Once a majority of validators have done so, the slash is accepted by virtue of being enforced since the slash is now running on the majority of nodes.

This puts a lot of power in the hands of the developers who control the software.  Because I think we can all assume that validators *want* to stay up to date with software releases and so there is *a lot* of inertia built into the system.  Certainly some less than optimal choices by the foundation could be carried through just on that inertia.  This is worrisome.

The comforting part is that the foundation is very motivated to do the right thing, knowing that the entire success of solana depends on validator and end-user mindshare, which would be highly compromised by nefarious actions on the part of the foundation.

* Solanas circulating supply did not include the tokens that were given to a market maker
* Solana burned tokens, but then secretly re-minted them later a few days later when no one was looking
* Solanas consistent refusal to spend the time to build a block explorer... which enabled them to hide that the circulating supply was actually much higher than previously acknowledged.  This information about the circulating supply only came to light once a block explorer was created (and then the block explorer was handicapped by only letting you look at 40% of the chains history)",True,False,0,1605270414,,False,0,gc5b1lf,True,t3_jt8eo3,False,t1_gc4nyua,/r/solana/comments/jt8eo3/is_there_any_official_update_to_this_from_the_team/gc5b1lf/,,1616772351.0,6,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1515116488.0,t2_f211il,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"It costs SOL to occupy disk space.  You can use the 'solana rent' command to find out how much.

Solana allows every account holding data to maintain a minimum balance to avoid paying any rent on that data, and since most people would choose to keep their minimum balance above the rent level rather than paying rent, let's just focus on that.

Rent is calculated based on the number of bytes that are being stored.

Right now, the rent exempt minimum for 1000 bytes of storage is 0.00785088 SOL, which is currently about 20 US cents.

As you can see, it would be expensive to try to spam data onto the Solana network.  If you tried to spam 1 GB, you'd have to keep a minimum balance of 6960 SOL, which is about $180,000 at current prices.

That is money that you'd have to keep locked up in Solana in a non-interest-bearing account (i.e. not staked), and since Solana has inflation (currently about 8%), you'd actually be losing $14,476 per year plus lost opportunity cost on that money.

This is perhaps more within the realm of feasability of an attacker since 14 grand is not excessive.  However, 1 GB of data isn't going to make much difference to most validators, where the drive size dedicated to the ledger is typically more than 300 GB, often more than 1 TB.

So to really make a difference, try 200 GB.  Now you're gonna have to keep 1392000 SOL locked up to avoid rent, which is $36 million worth, and lose 2.8 million per year on inflation, plus lost opportunity costs.

In terms of the size of transaction storage, transactions are only stored temporarily -- most validators only keep a couple days worth of history.  All that anyone *really* needs is the current verified state, all transactions can continue to proceed just with this minimum information.  I don't know why history is even kept at all, I think it's just because theoretically a fork can last for a while so you'd better have history to be able to go back to the point of a fork when needed, although forks usually only last seconds.

a. The fact that there is no comprehensive description of how the system works that can be scrutinized by experts.  There are some high level descriptions available of the various pieces but nothing comprehensive.  I am pretty sure that most of it just evolved in code as the developers figured out how to make it work.  As a result, I don't think anyone can say for sure whether or not there are fundamental weaknesses that haven't been realized yet.

b. It seems to require an awful lot of network communication between peers and not all of the network is decentralized -- there are unique and specific endpoints that most users have to go through.  I suspect that the validators, even though they mostly coordinate through decentralized means, probably still have some dependence on centralized servers for some aspects.  This is concerning because it creates a single point, or small number of points, of potential failure.

c. Many of the 'core' features that seem like they must be necessary to allow the system to work without being shepherded by enthusiasts, and which would be necessary in the face of attack by bad actors, do not seem to exist.  For example, slashing, which would be necessary to provide negative feedback to prevent attempts at double spends and such, are just placeholders with promises that ""we think it will probably work"", but as far as I can tell, no implementation at all.  So there are fundamental parts that are incomplete and I think the whole thing is working only because initial adopters, early enthusiasts, and the founders are working hard to keep everything going despite the whole thing not being complete yet.

d. This is not a concern about Solana itself but it is a concern just about the value of SOL tokens, which is only of interest to anyone hoping to 'get rich' off of early adoption.  SOL are not difficult to generate (that's the whole point of PoS over PoW) relative to the value that they provide.  The only reason to buy a SOL is to use it to pay for some transactions, but when transactions are very very cheap, you don't need to buy much SOL.  I think Bitcoin has shown that you don't actually need to be able to do anything *practically useful* with a cryptocurrency for people to place short term value on it (my theory is that its value goes to 0 when coins can no longer be minted and the only way for miners to make money is on transactions that people have no need to or desire to engage in), but when there is no (or very limited) artificial scarcity as in SOL, I do not know if utility is enough to give it much 'hype value'.  It's going up continuously right now but I don't know if that's because of clever pumping by whales, overall cryptocurrency hype, or actual interest by a large number of people.

The cryptographic timestamps take real time to generate and are pre-image resistant. Meaning that the output of the latest SHA256 hash, is used to generate the next hash. Essentially forming a sequential hash chain that can't be faked. 

Transactions and votes are then appended within these hashes to mark an instance in time of when they occurred. In a way, this helps us cheat the two general problems by allowing nodes to **optimistically** progress before consensus. 

Then during the consensus process that follows - the system/nodes then checks the validity of these transactions/messages by having nodes on the network vote on the ledger each block (every 400ms) for what they believe to be the accurate version of the ledger based on the data they receive from the network. 

We call our consensus mechanism Tower BFT (you can read more on this here:  [https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79](https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79) ).

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).  I don't mind at the outset where they are using that SOL as leverage to build the ecosystem (via rewards and staking grants, and eventually staking pool grants).

False,aeyakovenko,founder,,Anatoly (Co-Founder),"1. Yes, but you quickly run out of bandwidth.  if you have 1gbps input, you would need 2gbps output on every downstream node to reach the whole network in log(network size)
2. Verifiers respond as fast as they can.  this is where the leader can basically pick and choose their favorite verifiers and do some censorship up until 2/3+1 majority requirement.  but, so can every leader, and everyones ""choice"" of censorship is encoded into the chain.  Basically, if you censor someone, expect them to censor you back equally.
3.  right now we have a bare bones gossip protocol that sends random requests, but checkout this issue to optimize convergence, https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/302
4. It's because we can do optimistic concurrency control.  Basically, all the verifiers can optimistically vote assuming that everyone else will vote as well without observing anyone else vote.  When they actually observe the votes later they can trust the PoH data structure without witnessing the votes directly.

This also coincided with the confirmation that the move to Solana was still on. 

The price 10x for a day. 

So I'm some some insider pennies we're made. 

Plus, any deal Solana offered kin was probably put on the back burner. Just incase there were any repercussions regarding funding. After all, it was a fund raising exercise which got kik into these issues in the first place. So why shout from the rooftops that you've just acquired more funding from a third party ico.  

So yes, it's all smoke and mirrors. 

Everybody wants transparency but the truth is, it's kill or be Killed out there. 

I mean look at omg...  They're attitude to the ico holders is awful! No news. They send out the signals the project has issues and may never come to fruition.  The price plummets... Then one day, you can see people are soaking up sell pressure and then they release usdt news and main net launch, Naughty naughty!

It seems that Solana has over 1000 tps with it still not yet being mainstream. Ethereum on the other hand caps out at 15 tps. This big difference suggests that the concept of a ‚Äútransaction‚Äù is different in both networks.

To do the entire work of an Eth transaction in Solana, would this require multiple Solana transactions? What is the factor here? If 1 Eth tx is equivalent to 100 Sol tx, the improvement with Solana is still remarkable but not an improvement factor of 10k. Likewise, where are the 1000 tps coming from when there is not yet that much trading going on?

a. I discount this one because the code is open source, which is what matters at the end of the day. Documentation is great, but frequently does not match the actual code. Each crypto project is its own bug bounty program for black hat hackers. There is plenty of incentive for them to look for weaknesses in Solana. 

b Can you point to evidence of ""specific endpoints that most users have to go through?""

c Took a quick look at the code base and did not find any reference to slashing, could you point to the placeholder to which you refer?

d This one is a concern for me. Their inflation system is complicated and thus difficult to understand. I am concerned that as a venture capital backed project, they will not be able to resist the temptation to print their own money if / when there's a big market for it.

I think your theory about Bitcoin, when block rewards are gone, is valid for retail users, but if it becomes a settlement system for big institutions then the fee system should work. That said, it does seem like there is probably a more energy efficient way to do this.

Solana's price action has been quite curious the last few days. It seemed to become uncorrelated to the rest of the crypto market on Monday.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"The design is not inherently centralized.  But of course at the outset the thing gets shepherded by a central authority until it is fully self-sustaining.

Perhaps part of the confusion here is that some people seem to be asking questions about the fundamental design and expected ultimate outcome, and others are focusing on the current partial realization of that design.

Ultimately there is no central authority because someone else could come along with better software and take mindshare of validators and create a duopoly of control.  Repeat the process and eventually there is a plurality of vendors providing software and therefore influencing the overall workings of the network.

I don't think there has ever been nor will ever be any kind of system like this that wasn't highly ""centralized"" (if that's the term we're choosing to describe this) at the outset and centralized to some degree even after that.  Bitcoin for example was highly dependent on the original source code base and I'm pretty sure that the cabal of developers who were working on it early on were the centralized authority of bitcoin.  I didn't follow the history very closely (stopped watching in 2011 when it was clear that bitcoin would never scale) but there was a split with bitcoin cash wasn't there?  Imagine if all the developers had agreed with the changes that BCH wanted to make.  Then I am 100% confident that there would have been no split, just a change in the bitcoin protocol enforced via mindshare of the majority of bitcoin developers, and following from them everyone who took the bitcoin software.  That's exactly what you're calling a ""central authority"".  They are unavoidable.

However, even the ""central authority"" doesn't have complete control.  Anyone can come along and erode that authority if they can make better software that validators want to take.

And I would expect Solana to evolve in that direction, where the foundation is actively working to reduce their own authority by adding more automated mechanisms to the Solana protocol that don't rely or even accept any central oversight.  Slashing is an interesting example.  I don't know how they are thinking to decentralize it.  Allow validators to propose a slash and then have all the other validators vote on it?  Seems most logical.  Maybe the slash proposal would have a URL in it where the validator proposing the slash could lay out their case?

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).  I don't mind at the outset where they are using that SOL as leverage to build the ecosystem (via rewards and staking grants, and eventually staking pool grants).

My point is, if you are investing long term, then short term price due to token releases should not matter. If you want a short term option, then Solana may not be the best choice. Everybody has different metrics they look at. Most people do not understand the underlying dynamics so if the open market is buying a token with low liquidity then the price will go far past it‚Äôs actually value. 

Then you also need to factor in market manipulation, liquidity, tokenomics etc..

It‚Äôs all very complex in crypto, much more than traditional markets. I‚Äôm just speaking from my experience with finance and crypto. My professional background is Finance (fintech specifically), but in recent years I‚Äôve been full time crypto. Solana is the real deal. Do not listen to FUD.

I see this happen alot - people mix things that are true and verifiable, with things that are theoretical and not implemented, and it causes a lot of confusion.

Inflation is implemented and happening right now.  It's around 8% per year, and will reduce a little bit each year, until it hits a constant 1.5% in about 11 years.  Here is all the details on that:

https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/ed_overview/ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_protocol_based_rewards

Slashing - the mechanism for punishing validators who break the rules - is NOT implemented.  It's all theory right now.

The only concrete thing that slashing has been proposed to be used for is for punishing validators who break the voting rules -- the rules are that validators are not supposed to 'switch forks' for a certain amount of time after voting on a fork (if there are two forks and a validator chooses to vote on fork A and not B, then that validator is committed to only voting on fork A for a certain period of time; if the validator wants to switch to fork B because it believes that fork has become the better fork, it must wait to do so but not voting on fork A for a while until it has satisfied the waiting period, then it can switch to voting on fork B; this is to provide the mechanism that forces validators to commit to forks which then allows forks to win or lose; if every validator voted on every fork, then no fork would ever die and there would just be more and more forks).

But there is noting right now preventing a validator from breaking those rules and voting on multiple forks at once.  In fact, validators are kind of economically incentivized to do so because they will be guaranteed to get more votes in, which makes more money.  As far as I know, validators are currently being honest and following the fork voting rules; but if they are doing so, it's just out of honesty.  There is no penalty for being dishonest, because there is no slashing implemented.  (Also, i would take expertise and work to modify the validator code to allow this kind of multi-fork voting, and nobody with the time and expertise has been motivated to do that, as far as I know.)

Then there are nebulous claims that slashing could be implemented to deal with provably malicious validators - for example a validator which can be shown to have tried to consistently cheat with false transactions or something like that, or which has a pattern of creating unnecessary forks so flagrantly that it must be malicious, etc.  The mechanism for this slashing has never been fully explained, just hinted at.  But because deciding on guilt would involve some degree of human judgement, it's hard to see how this would happen without the Solana Foundation just coding the slash directly into the validator code and convincing all the validators to accept that new software that enforces the slash.  The foundation has great power here because most validators will just blindly go along with whatever the foundation says, and will install whatever new version of the validator software the foundation makes.

If this all seems a little unsatisfactory to you, then we're in agreement.  I think the foundation needs to implement a mechanism for automated slashing of validators who violate vote rules.  But I guess this will take some time.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"Solana has been tested to actually achieve 50,000 TPS on real hardware and networks.  However, you need people out there to actually submit 50,000 TPS for there to be that many transactions to even process, and right now there are only about 1,000 transactions per second being submitted (with most of those being votes).

So there is a lot of unused capacity in the Solana network right now.  It will take some time before enough apps and things have been built on Solana for those transaction counts to start creeping up into the tens of thousands.

I don't know anything about DOT.  Does it have a real, functioning, working network right now or is it just another idea waiting to be realized (which for most, never seems to happen)?

I bought 3 bitcoins in 2011.  Should have bought much more but I could see that the transaction rate would never be sufficient to do what people were claiming it would do at the time, which was become a global currency used by end-users everywhere.  So I lost interest.  I sold two of them when they were at $600 apiece, figuring that a 20x return was about the best I could expect.  I still have the last one, which I will hold until it either nets me enough money that I don't need any more, or it becomes worthless.

By the way, in 2011 I was also really concerned with the 'bitcoin founder' holding millions of BTC that he/she/they minted in the first year or two before bitcoin was even public.  I thought, why would I get involved in a currency where one single entity already owns most of it?  Unfortunately I did not realize that most/all of that bitcoin was lost, the private keys probably never even stored but thrown away immediately.  Surely if they were kept someone would have sold some of those bitcoin by now.

My point being, my understanding back then of the early mover advantage - I thought I had already missed the boat on Bitcoin in 2011, not realize that *I* was the early mover - really cost me a lot.  I am hoping not to make that same mistake with Solana.  Even though I missed the true early mover period (having been aware of this for years now but not even bothering to get involved until recently) I accept that I am still an early mover and will stick with it.",True,,0,1617060799,,1617061058.0,0,gsqsvjn,False,t3_mfyoqj,False,t3_mfyoqj,/r/solana/comments/mfyoqj/1000_tps_on_a_coin_thats_barely_used_for_now_with/gsqsvjn/,,,6,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gsqsvjn,1627306514.0,

Even I was thinking about the price to reach $5. But in this analysis, I want to share my two possible scenarios that the trend may play out.

Two Possible Scenarios

The first scenario - If the price will continue its unstoppable surge then, it may reach up to $4.5 -$5 in no time after the potential test of the recent resistance that turns into support around 32,500- 33,000sats on a daily chart. From there, we need to see the price to rebound.

The second scenario - If the price will follow the Elliot wave count. It may retrace back to the wave 4 correction phase in the Fibonacci below around 0.236 - 0.382 level as bearish divergence is present as well. Then, it should rebound for further price surge continuation up to $5 or even more.",True,False,0,1598677341,,False,0,g37ouxk,True,t3_iimolf,False,t3_iimolf,/r/solana/comments/iimolf/sols_chart_analysis_could_sol_continue_its_price/g37ouxk/,,1611175635.0,6,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,,t2_7ahlxgip,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

* Solanas own market maker on Binance dumped at ATH to rebuy at a fraction of the price
* Solanas circulating supply did not include the tokens that were given to a market maker
* Solana burned tokens, but then secretly re-minted them later a few days later when no one was looking
* Solanas consistent refusal to spend the time to build a block explorer... which enabled them to hide that the circulating supply was actually much higher than previously acknowledged.

,SolanaGoddess,,,,"Reposting my comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/kpjlez/how_solana_plans_to_handle_90_of_the_tokens/).

I'll caveat this by saying I'm not an expert. I'm a crypto professional who's been following the project, reading the transparency reports, and have close friends who work at trading desks and have been accumulating SOL.

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98. Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock?

None of this is investment advice, and I will admit I'm heavily biased as I have accumulated the large, large majority of my portfolio in SOL. But I think over the next few days the market will start to take notice of these facts. TheCryptoDog (with &gt;250k followers) has been tweeting this too: [https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784)

,SolanaLabs,,,,"Hey! Happy to help explain. Solana is a PoS network that uses an innovation called 'Proof of History' before consensus to reach speeds of 50,000 tps +. Proof of History (PoH) is a globally-available, permissionless source of time in the network that works before consensus. POH is not a consensus protocol or anti-Sybil mechanism. Rather, POH is a solution to the clock problem.

Whereas other blockchains require validators to talk to one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF)

There are a total of 8 core innovations that allow the Solana network to operate at such speeds with sub-second confirmation times: [https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda)",True,False,0,1600974466,,False,0,g6ge2zy,False,t3_iz2l0q,False,t3_iz2l0q,/r/solana/comments/iz2l0q/solanas_consensus_algorithm/g6ge2zy/,,1613243462.0,6,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,,t2_48o4a4e8,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

Tweet thread where CMC committed to making the fix happen: https://twitter.com/zmanian/status/1292642715725832192


You can see on CoinGecko that the circ supply increase was much more gradual. We finally got CMC to commit to timely updates (now in the form of the API endpoint that CoinGecko and¬†explorer.solana.com/supply¬†have used for many months) which we were happy about. But because their historical graph only updates when they update the number, this resulted in a supposed ""spike"" in circ supply. The reality is that the graph just represents the changes in what CMC was tracking, not actual change in circ supply.

If you dig through ACTUAL DATA you will see that the APY is at best around 8.25% right now.  That's if you use a 0% commission validator (there aren't many) that gets the best returns.  TBH my validator (Blade Validator) is about the best return validator out there right now and I'm not too shy to say it.  But the difference between the best and middle of the pack is only about 0.5% APY so we're not talking huge differences here.  Your best bet is to spread stake around to give yourself the greatest security and also to help the network by supporting the most validators.

If you are so inclined, you can research the actual APY using the solana command line client.  You can go to solanabeach.io, find a validator, click on it, and then find its largest stake account.  Then you use the solana command line client to query about that stake account and see its recent returns.  That will tell you the APY being achieved by that validator (the APY is the same for all stake accounts staked to a validator; I always pick the largest just because the numbers are biggest and thus least subject to rounding errors).

For example, using my validator:

At solanabeach.io, I click the menu icon in the upper right and switch to Validators view.

Then in the list I see Blade Validator at spot 45.  I click on that to go to a details page for that validator.  Scrolling down to the Delegators list I see the largest Stake Account at the top of the list and click on it.

Now I am on a Stake Account Details page, and I go to the Address and use the copy icon to copy the address.

Then I go to my terminal and use the solana command line client like so to get details of that stake account:

I can see here every epoch for the past 6 epochs and the APY for each epoch.

It's currently at 8.23%.  It went up from 7.74% because I just set my commission to 0% last epoch, it was 8% previously.  So you can see that the difference in returns from an 8% commission validator and a 0% commission validator is about 0.5% APY.  Not a huge difference, but not insignificant either.

You can do the above with any validator, choosing its largest stake account and then using solana stake-account command to find out what kind of APY that validator has been achieving.  Here are some examples for the most recent epoch:

    Chorus One: 7.40% APY
    Everstake: 8.09% APY
    melea.xyz: 8.17% APY
    Forbole: 7.47% APY

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"In my opinion 'wallet' is a concept that just creates confusion.  You don't need any wallet.  Any SOL 'system account' that can hold SOL or control staking delegation is just a public/private key pair, which is just a pair of long numbers.  That's ALL that you need.  You can generate a keypair and then store that data somewhere and always have a way to control your account from that data.  You don't need any software as you can just download the Solana command line client any time you need it, use it with keypair, and the uninstall it until you need it again.

There is a way to 'store' your public and private key as a sequence of 12 English words and a passcode you generate.  All you're really storing at that point is the data necessary to re-generate the public and private key pair (that data being encoded in 12 English words); but the nice thing is that you can write and store those 12 words anywhere (including on something like a laminated paper card that you keep under your mattress) and as long as you remember the passcode as well (probably a good idea to write this down too, or even better write down a 'reminder' that will help you remember it if you forget it, but won't help someone who doesn't know the passcode already guess it) and store that somewhere separate.

If you do that, then starting with just those 12 words and your remembered passcode, you can take any computer (that you trust!), download the Solana command line client, and do every transaction you need to, with no other software needing to be installed persistently.

In terms of the number of SOL 'system accounts' you need, I think you really only need 1.  I have one SOL system account (i.e. public/private key pair that I store encoded as 12 English words along with a passcode) and that is controlling 6 staking accounts to which I delegated my SOL and then staked to validators, all using the command line client.

That one SOL system account controls them all and that means that 'all my eggs are in one basket', so if you are truly paranoid, you could split your system account into multiple and then keep all of those 12 word groups and passcodes separately stored in separate safe locations and then use them like a bunch of smaller separate accounts instead of one big account.  However, at that point you have also increased your risk of making errors since you have that many more moving pieces to manage so you will have to decide for yourself what you are comfortable with.

If my SOL ever became worth ""real money"" I would definitely split it across more than on Solana system account, but for the time being, I am just fine with just one.

I periodically check my balances using the command line tool which forces me to repeat the process of acquiring those 12 words and remembering my passcode, so that I don't forget how the software works or  what my passcode is.

EDIT: I should point out that starting from those 12 words and passcode and using the Solana command line interface, I believe (although have never done this) that you can send SOL to any ""hosted wallet"" you want to, I think those services just provide a SOL address to send your SOL to (which you would do with the command line client) and then those services manage the SOL transactions from that SOL system account -- which they own and control by the way, so at that point you are 100% trusting a third party to hold your SOL for you -- and can trade them on their platform.

For example, I did try to create a Binance.us account although it seems like they will never validate me for trades since what happens on that site seems to be up to the whims of fate and phases of the moon - but they are happy to tell me about a SOL address that I can send my SOL to so that they can own it on my behalf and theoretically trade it for other stuff.",True,,0,1614045537,,1614105154.0,0,goeurdi,False,t3_lq2nug,True,t1_goed3op,/r/solana/comments/lq2nug/omg/goeurdi/,,,1,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 125, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'When you come across a feel-good thing.', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_5f123e3d-4f48-42f4-9c11-e98b566d5897', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Wholesome', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92932f465d58e4c16b12b6eac4ca07d27e3d11c0', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d11484a208d68a318bf9d4fcf371171a1cb6a7ef', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febdf28b6f39f7da7eb1365325b85e0bb49a9f63', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4406a2d88bf86fa3dc8a45aacf7e0c7bdccc4fb', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19555b13e3e196b62eeb9160d1ac1d1b372dcb0b', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92932f465d58e4c16b12b6eac4ca07d27e3d11c0', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d11484a208d68a318bf9d4fcf371171a1cb6a7ef', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febdf28b6f39f7da7eb1365325b85e0bb49a9f63', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4406a2d88bf86fa3dc8a45aacf7e0c7bdccc4fb', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19555b13e3e196b62eeb9160d1ac1d1b372dcb0b', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_goeurdi,1627036554.0,

I've already showed you what metrics I used in a valuation: that is supply and a working product for starter. And Solana has no working product or users and supply will increased come Jan 2021, so price will drop by then. Im not assigning a value since it is nothing but an idea at this point.

Go google every secondary offering in any market history and you never see price pump on such announcements.

I just tried to create another new one, it showed up. I cancel it, it was deleted, the usdt went to unsettled status, I settled them, usdt back in the balance. I compared the steps in the # between the two orders and I don't see any differences between them in the steps. In an another one # I see the cancel and later again in an another one the settle funds transaction.

UPDATE: after (like) another hour of searching...

So I started to look step by step through all the single steps with the order creation transaction and checked all the addresses that were used during that creation. While doing this I recognized, the market address raydium for the ray-usdt pair did changed. So I added manually in the url the old one address that was in my order creation # for the market et voil√† suddenly I could see my order! The pair is quoted as RAY/USDT-V2 whatever USDT-V2 now means. So I did all the steps, cancel, settle and all funds now back in my wallet.

Not we will burn the tokens they will just aim to..they might aim and miss whoops sorry about that...we will aim again and see what happens. Beware of imprecise and indefinite syntax. Kin holders know this because before the Kin sale it was stated  **any unsold tokens will be burned**  Lo and behold all of the unsold tokens were given away instead and Kik Interactive twisted themselves into pretzels trying to explain that GIVING AWAY UNSOLD TOKENS was the same as burning them. Pro Fucking Tip u/ted_on_reddit ITS FUCKING NOT
So your opaque blockchain on Solana and the founders stated ''we aim to burn the tokens'' is not really worth the electrons its printed with. You will burn those tokens by such and such a date or you will not..you make definitive statements Not weasely syntax leaving ambiguity and outs. Any way SOLANA does not SOLVE KINS LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. It will solve SOLANAS high market price by dragging Solana into the crosshairs of the SEC and providing a litigious future and uncertain outlook for SOL. This will allow all the weakhands to exit gracesfully and leave the bagholders waiting for muh moon launch. If you have made money with SOL be proactive and get out now, you like it so much you can probably buy back later for much much less.  Kin is not going to add value to SOLANA and Solana is not going to add value to KIN. Kin is a POISON PILL that will choke Solana. The SEC will finish the job Kin started.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"The validators with 0% commission are running at a loss right now trying to gather stake.  It is also possible that they own a lot of SOL on their own and run their own validator.  In that case, it doesn't matter what commission they choose because all the SOL is going to go to themselves anyway.  So maybe they then choose 0% in hopes of attracting some stake that they can take advantage of someday.

At any rate, validators with 0% commission will eventually raise it once they have collected enough stake so that they can finally make some SOL.  So don't expect 0% commission to last.  Forbole is a good example - they were 0% commission for a while and just switched to 9% commission.

The reason for a large number of 10% commission validators is because a lot of them were started by people taking advantage of the Solana Foundation passing out stake as part of a program to attract new validators.  I suspect the foundation put a requirement that these validators charge no more than 10% commission, and most of them chose to go with the maximum to get the most SOL out of the foundation stake delegation.  They are all probably aware that they have little chance of attracting other stake but they started a validator knowing that the compromise was that they'd get guaranteed stake from the foundation and are happy to just make the most they can off of that.

In the ranges of commission between 0% and 10%, you have a variety of commissions chosen by each validator to try to maximize their growth while at the same time maximizing current SOL take where they can get it.  Everyone has their own way to decide what the best commission is.

I have tracked the gains on several stake accounts and sampled a lot of data.  It turns out that the difference between 0% commission and 8% commission is only about 1% difference in yearly earnings on stake.  So it actually doesn't even matter all that much what the commission is -- unless you are super concerned with every last percent of return.  You have to balance the needs of the Solana network (spreading stake to some validators with a slightly higher commission) against your desire to earn the absolute best possible return (down to a 1% difference).",True,,0,1617212091,,False,0,gsxqpxd,False,t3_mh3tdu,True,t3_mh3tdu,/r/solana/comments/mh3tdu/delegate_to_who/gsxqpxd/,,,2,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gsxqpxd,1627317391.0,

What will Solana talk about in this Webinar?
It will be a recap on DeFi. 
But, what is DeFi?
Decentralized Finance (or more simply DeFi) refers to an ecosystem of financial applications developed on the basis of network blockchain. 

More precisely, the term Decentralized Finance can refer to a movement that aims to create an ecosystem of financial services open source, permissionless and transparent, which is available to all and operates without any central authority. Users would retain full control of their assets, interacting with this ecosystem through decentralized (dapp) peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.

Parachain leases will only be used by the very large players (such as exchanges) to eliminate gas fees, everyone else will be using parathreads that pay gas fees.  Gavin Wood reckons this was a massive problem in Ethereum because they have a ""one model fits all"" ethos and large players pay far too much for usage.  The theory is large players will be prepared to pay in opportunity cost to hire a parachain which is proportional to the money they can save by not paying gas fees.  Free market economics would suggest this should happen but the maths is not trivial to me.  The thing about Polkadot is that if this doesn't work the DOT holders will just vote to change it.  Solana's governance means it's not up to the tokenholders and there is no plan to allow them voting rights (correct me if I'm wrong) even on the tokenonics which is likely to lead to market imbalanced like on Ethereum - you can't top manage this stuff.  This is my biggest issue with Solana and the only reason I am not currently invested.  However adding EVM support would be a massive plus.  It could be that Solana lives along side Polkadot due to it's huge throughput and Polkadot never implement anything that fast but it seems pretty unlikely to me.

2. Verifiers respond as fast as they can.  this is where the leader can basically pick and choose their favorite verifiers and do some censorship up until 2/3+1 majority requirement.  but, so can every leader, and everyones ""choice"" of censorship is encoded into the chain.  Basically, if you censor someone, expect them to censor you back equally.
3.  right now we have a bare bones gossip protocol that sends random requests, but checkout this issue to optimize convergence, https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/302
4. It's because we can do optimistic concurrency control.  Basically, all the verifiers can optimistically vote assuming that everyone else will vote as well without observing anyone else vote.  When they actually observe the votes later they can trust the PoH data structure without witnessing the votes directly.

And the supply is only going to keep increasing due to inflation.

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).  I don't mind at the outset where they are using that SOL as leverage to build the ecosystem (via rewards and staking grants, and eventually staking pool grants).  But I think that eventually they need to have a plan to burn that once Solana is wholly self-sustaining because one entity controlling 1/4 of the supply forever just seems bad.

Bitcoin has a 21 Million Limit..(but to be fair each bitcoin can be broken down into 100Million parts) Solana..has what 500M coins total...and now your blockchain is going to be used by a Token with a 1.5 Trillion circulating supply and a 10 Trillion total supply.

False,nossocc,,,,"I think Solana is a very promising project. In my opinion a problem with the crypto space is that a lot of the community and developers are quite new engineers. Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?"" I don't know. But in terms of a long term investment in my opinion Solana is solid, it's just that right now it's probably overvalued like everything else.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"There are efforts currently underway to create what are called ""stake pools"".  These are going to be a network-supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its SOL to validators.  The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right.  It's sort of a second layer of staking, where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security.

I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months.

Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster - 'stake boss' is a thing soon to be released (from what I have read) by Block Logic, the company that does validators.app.  Stake Boss is not a true stake pool - there is no token created to represent membership, it's a much more direct mechanism where you simply re-assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security.  In this case you're basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you, that manager being Stake Boss.  It's similar to what stake pools will be in practice.

Keep in mind that it's not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top; if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing, you may be fine with that.  You're basically paying to have your stake managed, which is a perfectly valid service that you may find worth the cost.

Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools (and possibly Stake Boss, although I don't know Block Logic's exact plans, only they know) will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around.  Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know, some may spread only a little bit, it will be up to how the pool is managed.

So when those come online, there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage.

If you are not in the USA, then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators -- it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the ""Tour de SOL"" whereby they prove the quality of their systems, and once they pass all the hurdles, then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225,000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself.  More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program.  However, this is only available to non-US participants, and it also only happens occasionally, and furthermore, I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators.

I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through ""connections"".  The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL.  Those institutional investors don't even seem to care that much about the quality of validation - the highest stake validator, Chorus One, was down for more than 9 hours last epoch, which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators - and yet Chorus One didn't lose any stake because of it, instead they seem to just be gaining more ...

So to some degree, stake begets more stake, which makes it even harder for those trying to enter.  You are going to have to rely on connections, if you have them, and handouts from the foundation and stake pools, if and when those become available.

Once you have some stake and are in the system, you can then try to attract more, with lower commission, better service, better returns, additional services offered, and ... marketing.  Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists.  This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention.  We'll see ....

p.s. if you are considering running a validator, you may want to consult my spreadsheet of expected Validator returns.  You will have to make a copy of the sheet to be able to edit the values, but it will allow you to play with the numbers, put in what you might expect to achieve ... it calculates expected profit and also calculates what the amount of SOL you'd have to have staked to your validator is in order to break even.

I've done my math and believe that my break even point with this validator is $2.42/SOL.  As long as SOL stays above that I should be able to earn profit.  If you count opportunity cost of the initial investment then the price will probably have to be over $3 for this to make sense financially.

Right now the price of SOL is high enough that a profit should be easily obtainable this year.  The future is uncertain though - if the price drops, or if it becomes difficult to move SOL due to lack of liquidity in the markets, it could be much less worthwile endeavor.

By the way, I also priced out an Amazon AWS instance of approximate capability as my colo'd design, and the break even there was $13.17 per SOL.  technically still profitable but only barely and AWS egress network fees are so outrageous that you'd be on a razor's edge -- any increase in network requirements of the Solana network could easily wipe out all profits and put you into the red.

p.s. My expected first year cost for running a validator is $11,597.50, if that helps.

p.p.s. I should mention that I have a friend with a lot of SOL who is willing to stake with me which is the only reason that this has any chance of being profitable.

It seems that Solana has over 1000 tps with it still not yet being mainstream. Ethereum on the other hand caps out at 15 tps. This big difference suggests that the concept of a ‚Äútransaction‚Äù is different in both networks.

To do the entire work of an Eth transaction in Solana, would this require multiple Solana transactions? What is the factor here?

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I personally am concerned by a few things:

a. The fact that there is no comprehensive description of how the system works that can be scrutinized by experts.  There are some high level descriptions available of the various pieces but nothing comprehensive.  I am pretty sure that most of it just evolved in code as the developers figured out how to make it work.  As a result, I don't think anyone can say for sure whether or not there are fundamental weaknesses that haven't been realized yet.

b. It seems to require an awful lot of network communication between peers and not all of the network is decentralized -- there are unique and specific endpoints that most users have to go through.  I suspect that the validators, even though they mostly coordinate through decentralized means, probably still have some dependence on centralized servers for some aspects.  This is concerning because it creates a single point, or small number of points, of potential failure.

c. Many of the 'core' features that seem like they must be necessary to allow the system to work without being shepherded by enthusiasts, and which would be necessary in the face of attack by bad actors, do not seem to exist.  For example, slashing, which would be necessary to provide negative feedback to prevent attempts at double spends and such, are just placeholders with promises that ""we think it will probably work"", but as far as I can tell, no implementation at all.  So there are fundamental parts that are incomplete and I think the whole thing is working only because initial adopters, early enthusiasts, and the founders are working hard to keep everything going despite the whole thing not being complete yet.

d. This is not a concern about Solana itself but it is a concern just about the value of SOL tokens, which is only of interest to anyone hoping to 'get rich' off of early adoption.  SOL are not difficult to generate (that's the whole point of PoS over PoW) relative to the value that they provide.  The only reason to buy a SOL is to use it to pay for some transactions, but when transactions are very very cheap, you don't need to buy much SOL.  I think Bitcoin has shown that you don't actually need to be able to do anything *practically useful* with a cryptocurrency for people to place short term value on it (my theory is that its value goes to 0 when coins can no longer be minted and the only way for miners to make money is on transactions that people have no need to or desire to engage in), but when there is no (or very limited) artificial scarcity as in SOL, I do not know if utility is enough to give it much 'hype value'.  It's going up continuously right now but I don't know if that's because of clever pumping by whales, overall cryptocurrency hype, or actual interest by a large number of people.  I suspect it's a combination of all three but I don't know the exact ratios.",True,,0,1614187211,,1614187406.0,0,golpazt,False,t3_lrdnhm,False,t3_lrdnhm,/r/solana/comments/lrdnhm/solana_has_me_intrigued/golpazt/,,,10,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_golpazt,1627046834.0,

a. I discount this one because the code is open source, which is what matters at the end of the day. Documentation is great, but frequently does not match the actual code. Each crypto project is its own bug bounty program for black hat hackers. There is plenty of incentive for them to look for weaknesses in Solana. 

b Can you point to evidence of ""specific endpoints that most users have to go through?""

c Took a quick look at the code base and did not find any reference to slashing, could you point to the placeholder to which you refer?

d This one is a concern for me. Their inflation system is complicated and thus difficult to understand. I am concerned that as a venture capital backed project, they will not be able to resist the temptation to print their own money if / when there's a big market for it.

I think your theory about Bitcoin, when block rewards are gone, is valid for retail users, but if it becomes a settlement system for big institutions then the fee system should work. That said, it does seem like there is probably a more energy efficient way to do this.

Solana's price action has been quite curious the last few days. It seemed to become uncorrelated to the rest of the crypto market on Monday.

a. I discount this one because the code is open source, which is what matters at the end of the day. Documentation is great, but frequently does not match the actual code. Each crypto project is its own bug bounty program for black hat hackers. There is plenty of incentive for them to look for weaknesses in Solana. 

b Can you point to evidence of ""specific endpoints that most users have to go through?""

c Took a quick look at the code base and did not find any reference to slashing, could you point to the placeholder to which you refer?

d This one is a concern for me. Their inflation system is complicated and thus difficult to understand. I am concerned that as a venture capital backed project, they will not be able to resist the temptation to print their own money if / when there's a big market for it.

I think your theory about Bitcoin, when block rewards are gone, is valid for retail users, but if it becomes a settlement system for big institutions then the fee system should work. That said, it does seem like there is probably a more energy efficient way to do this.

Solana's price action has been quite curious the last few days. It seemed to become uncorrelated to the rest of the crypto market on Monday.

Not we will burn the tokens they will just aim to..they might aim and miss whoops sorry about that...we will aim again and see what happens. Beware of imprecise and indefinite syntax. Kin holders know this because before the Kin sale it was stated  **any unsold tokens will be burned**  Lo and behold all of the unsold tokens were given away instead and Kik Interactive twisted themselves into pretzels trying to explain that GIVING AWAY UNSOLD TOKENS was the same as burning them. Pro Fucking Tip u/ted_on_reddit ITS FUCKING NOT
So your opaque blockchain on Solana and the founders stated ''we aim to burn the tokens'' is not really worth the electrons its printed with. You will burn those tokens by such and such a date or you will not..you make definitive statements Not weasely syntax leaving ambiguity and outs. Any way SOLANA does not SOLVE KINS LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. It will solve SOLANAS high market price by dragging Solana into the crosshairs of the SEC and providing a litigious future and uncertain outlook for SOL. This will allow all the weakhands to exit gracesfully and leave the bagholders waiting for muh moon launch. If you have made money with SOL be proactive and get out now, you like it so much you can probably buy back later for much much less.  Kin is not going to add value to SOLANA and Solana is not going to add value to KIN. Kin is a POISON PILL that will choke Solana. The SEC will finish the job Kin started.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree with everything you just said.  It's why I got super excited about Bitcoin in 2011 but only bought 3 coins once I realized that the entire design is self-limiting in its transaction processing speed which means that it can never serve the purpose that it pretended to serve, which was as an anonymous decentralized form of money.  What I unfortunately did not realize at the time was that the market valuation of Bitcoin was not going to be based on its actual fitness for its supposed purpose, but more on speculation and hype.  Had I realized that I would be a much richer person than I am now :)

Solana gets me excited about cryptocurrency in the way that the original Bitcoin whitepaper did back then, but with Solana I see a system that can actually achieve the transaction speed and cost necessary to actually operate as a currency.  What I do not know is how much hype is necessary to allow Solana to thrive and whether or not that level of hype will be achieved.

There are also many aspects of Solana that I wonder about the technical soundness of, mostly because I do not understand Solana.  There is no clear, comprehensive, and complete white paper like there was for Bitcoin.  I read the Bitcoin whitepaper and could understand everything about it.  With Solana there are bits and pieces of generalized algorithms described but most of the technical details are probably just artifacts of how the code happens to be written.  That is disappointing to me.

Much less frequently, we find materials about other structural blockchains that are increasingly being considered for migration by decentralized projects that are not satisfied with the current speed, scalability, or transaction costs of the most popular networks. At the same time, many of them are able to offer innovative technologies, bring new trends to the market, and, arguably, take over the leadership in the near future. As the folk wisdom says, ‚ÄúForewarned means forearmed,‚Äù so 3commas(.io) has prepared a review of the Solana ecosystem, which is growing at an incredible pace and already leads in terms of bandwidth among all the existing blockchains.

,JayPBanks,,,,"That‚Äôs not how it works my friend. Market caps are literally based on free market price x tokens. You will see different sources base it off circulating, total, max. 

All you need to worry about (long term) is fully diluted supply x current price. If you think the current state of development is worth less than a max supply cap then it‚Äôs a good buy. 

Here is a good way to understand:
Solana is a layer 1 network, therefore it should be compared against other layer 1s (ETH, XTZ, XLM etc). You also need to factor in network functionality/capability (smart contracts, tx time etc) 

When you compare these networks, you ideally would be looking at all of them fully diluted with current state of development. 

Solana is currently valued at 30% of similar layer 1s. SOL is actually much better technologically than most layer 1s. It is easily worth the same as as many in the top 20.

Tron ($1B) 
Cardano ($2B)
Tezos ($2B)
EOS ($2.5B)
XLM ($1.5B)

In my opinion, Solana is worthy of being in that range. All of those are not even fully diluted for each network. Here is another example:

Algorand is a very comparable network to Solana as far as development, team, functionality etc..

ALGO circulating mcap is $194M but fully diluted is $2.5B. Solana is barely 10% fully diluted to Algorand max mcap but is a very comparable project. So if you‚Äôre buying ALGO at these prices over Solana then you‚Äôre saying it is 10x better fully diluted. This is laughable if anybody truly believes that. 

If you‚Äôre investing long term then you should look at the token distribution relative to when you believe you‚Äôll close your position. All of the networks I named should be valued in the range of $1B-$5B fully diluted mcap. 

Hopefully this helps. I started a financial support group last month to help people understand the complexities here. This is a simplified synopsis and should be taken lightly. Only for perspective. Good luck.

False,GhettoCryptoz,volunteer,,Dom (Volunteer Mod),"Here‚Äôs my understanding to date, I'm only assisting with community moderation. Not actually part of the team. But here goes: 

In it‚Äôs simplest form Proof of History (PoH) is a clock for blockchain.

However, unlike traditional methods where messages within the network are timestamped. Proof of History is a methodology to prove whether a certain message occurred sometime before or after an event. 

For example ‚Äì when you take a selfie with yourself and a newspaper article in it. You are essentially creating proof that your photograph was taken AFTER the newspaper was published. This is exactly what Proof of History does ‚Äì it enables the network to create a historical record to prove that a specific event occurred at a specific moment of time. You can learn more about PoH here: 

And it can do so in an objective, and decentralised manner. 

What does this mean in layman‚Äôs terms? 
Well this essentially means that nodes downstream can then verify the time and order of events within the network WITHOUT witnessing them directly. 

It‚Äôs important to note that PoH is NOT a consensus protocol. It instead adds valuable data (an objective measure of time) to the blockchain.                                                                                   

By adding this valuable data, it allows Solana to optimize other elements of the system without compromising key features or security. Some of these features include ‚ÄúAvalanche‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of Replication‚Äù, and together they allow Solana to achieve sub-second finality and maintain high throughput with minimal loss in finality time - even after the number of nodes on the network increase substantially. 

* Proof of Replication - To get slightly technical on how PoH allows Solana to optimize Proof of Replication (PoRep) by having a sense of time on the blokckchain, the network then doesn‚Äôt need to re-order the CBC blocks. Traditional systems, have to re-order the blocks because they don‚Äôt have an agreed sense of time, and this process is typically expensive. 
* Avalanche - I won‚Äôt get into the technical details of Avalanche ‚Äì and I‚Äôll let you learn from the master himself (the CTO of Solana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=144s

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"Maybe a misnomer but I think of it being 'centralized' in the sense of it still relying quite heavily on a single group - the Solana Foundation, run by the original founders - to keep it going.  It is not out of beta yet because it still does not support at least one absolutely critical feature - slashing - and without the support of the founders bringing out new software and slowly coaxing the network to life, it would not be self-sustaining (in my opinion).  There is a chance that it's already self-sustaining because enough validators may stick around indefinitely to keep it working, but without slashing and some other features, it is in a very precarious position.

Slashing is what is supposed to keep validators honest.  Right now there is nothing keeping them honest other than ... well ... honesty on the part of the validators.  A validator could violate the rules and nothing bad would happen.

EXCEPT that I think that it's probably likely that the foundation would have some way to manually slash a bad actor via a software release.  This is a way in which it is currently centralized: all of the algorithms and processes that are supposed to be built into Solana to make it secure and complete are not there yet, and everyone is depending on one central entity to bring those things online.  In that sense, it is controlled by that entity and thus centralized in a fashion.

However, once all the features are in place, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be considered a decentralized network.

,silverknight781,,,,"Jay thank you so much for your explanation here and later in this thread, it's rare to find real finance people willing to explain to us noobs. 

I have being doing DD on Solana for weeks and finally got in around $3.50, in for the long term. Admittedly I am a little worried I'm getting in at fully diluted mc of close to $2b but honestly I think it can be much more even. 

A few questions if you'll entertain:
1) when dilution comes (80-90% by eoy?) How does it come on the market? Will they release in a way that takes into account the price action so as to not destroy the technicals, or is it a regular trickling release, or released but locked for certain time, etc? Would like to learn about the mechanics and thinking behind token releases. 

1.1) on August 14, 2020 the MC doubled, is that due to a release in coins? Is there anywhere to check for how/why the MC calculation changed, so one can see record of releases in the past? To an noob, it's weird to see a coins mc go up but price flat. Would also love to learn about thinking behind releasing coins gradually for new tokens as well. 

2) on the tech side, what are some other L1 solutions you think has promise? I have been looking around and honestly cannot find anyone even close to SOL's credibility.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"In my opinion 'wallet' is a concept that just creates confusion.  You don't need any wallet.  Any SOL 'system account' that can hold SOL or control staking delegation is just a public/private key pair, which is just a pair of long numbers.  That's ALL that you need.  You can generate a keypair and then store that data somewhere and always have a way to control your account from that data.  You don't need any software as you can just download the Solana command line client any time you need it, use it with keypair, and the uninstall it until you need it again.

There is a way to 'store' your public and private key as a sequence of 12 English words and a passcode you generate.  All you're really storing at that point is the data necessary to re-generate the public and private key pair (that data being encoded in 12 English words); but the nice thing is that you can write and store those 12 words anywhere (including on something like a laminated paper card that you keep under your mattress) and as long as you remember the passcode as well (probably a good idea to write this down too, or even better write down a 'reminder' that will help you remember it if you forget it, but won't help someone who doesn't know the passcode already guess it) and store that somewhere separate.

If you do that, then starting with just those 12 words and your remembered passcode, you can take any computer (that you trust!), download the Solana command line client, and do every transaction you need to, with no other software needing to be installed persistently.

In terms of the number of SOL 'system accounts' you need, I think you really only need 1.  I have one SOL system account (i.e. public/private key pair that I store encoded as 12 English words along with a passcode) and that is controlling 6 staking accounts to which I delegated my SOL and then staked to validators, all using the command line client.

That one SOL system account controls them all and that means that 'all my eggs are in one basket', so if you are truly paranoid, you could split your system account into multiple and then keep all of those 12 word groups and passcodes separately stored in separate safe locations and then use them like a bunch of smaller separate accounts instead of one big account.  However, at that point you have also increased your risk of making errors since you have that many more moving pieces to manage so you will have to decide for yourself what you are comfortable with.

If my SOL ever became worth ""real money"" I would definitely split it across more than on Solana system account, but for the time being, I am just fine with just one.

I periodically check my balances using the command line tool which forces me to repeat the process of acquiring those 12 words and remembering my passcode, so that I don't forget how the software works or  what my passcode is.

EDIT: I should point out that starting from those 12 words and passcode and using the Solana command line interface, I believe (although have never done this) that you can send SOL to any ""hosted wallet"" you want to, I think those services just provide a SOL address to send your SOL to (which you would do with the command line client) and then those services manage the SOL transactions from that SOL system account -- which they own and control by the way, so at that point you are 100% trusting a third party to hold your SOL for you -- and can trade them on their platform.

For example, I did try to create a Binance.us account although it seems like they will never validate me for trades since what happens on that site seems to be up to the whims of fate and phases of the moon - but they are happy to tell me about a SOL address that I can send my SOL to so that they can own it on my behalf and theoretically trade it for other stuff.",True,,0,1614045537,,1614105154.0,0,goeurdi,False,t3_lq2nug,True,t1_goed3op,/r/solana/comments/lq2nug/omg/goeurdi/,,,1,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 125, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'When you come across a feel-good thing.', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_5f123e3d-4f48-42f4-9c11-e98b566d5897', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Wholesome', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92932f465d58e4c16b12b6eac4ca07d27e3d11c0', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d11484a208d68a318bf9d4fcf371171a1cb6a7ef', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febdf28b6f39f7da7eb1365325b85e0bb49a9f63', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4406a2d88bf86fa3dc8a45aacf7e0c7bdccc4fb', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19555b13e3e196b62eeb9160d1ac1d1b372dcb0b', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92932f465d58e4c16b12b6eac4ca07d27e3d11c0', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d11484a208d68a318bf9d4fcf371171a1cb6a7ef', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febdf28b6f39f7da7eb1365325b85e0bb49a9f63', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4406a2d88bf86fa3dc8a45aacf7e0c7bdccc4fb', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19555b13e3e196b62eeb9160d1ac1d1b372dcb0b', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_goeurdi,1627036554.0,

False,nossocc,,,,"I think Solana is a very promising project. In my opinion a problem with the crypto space is that a lot of the community and developers are quite new engineers. Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?"" I don't know. But in terms of a long term investment in my opinion Solana is solid, it's just that right now it's probably overvalued like everything else.

False,aeyakovenko,founder,,Anatoly (Co-Founder),"\&gt; What about the 50k-65k transactions per sec? [https://solana.com/](https://solana.com/) here you can check that there are like 1000 (1k) transactions per sec as much ... Is this because there are very few transactions using SOL block chain?

1k is the current load, about 50% consensus, 50% other use cases.  500tps steady state use case load is greater then all the other networks combined.  Validators don't need to provision their systems for anything but the current load, but modern day hardware like 5960x AMD chips can do 100ktps in standalone tests.

\&gt; I have tested SOLANA and is incredible fast, I have made 20 transactions already and they take lesst than 10 secs to arrive.

Which wallet are you using?  The ""showing up"" depends on the RPC infra supporting that wallet.  Sollet, which is using the serum public api nodes has the same infra as the traders/market makers using serum and should display the update in 1.2s on average

\&gt; NEXT QUESTION from the last point. If it takes $0.0001 , why does BINNACE chage 0.01 SOL? This doesn't make sense but probably is realted to the bussines practices of BINNACE rather of SOL chain. Fee:0.01 SOL‚âà $0.051648 (02-02-2021)

Binance's omniwallet creates temporary accounts for user deposits and withdrawals, which takes a bit more gas, and they round up to their smallest internal numbers.

\&gt; Another question from the last point. Who provides the HARDWARE to make transactions? As far as I know is what are called LEADERS and then Global Validators. The more LEADERS with better hardware the better the capabilities? Does SOLANA will provide LEADERS of their own? Anyone can be leader? Some of those questions are answered here: [https://solana.com/validators/#signup](https://solana.com/validators/#signup) And you can check the current LEADERS and VALIDATORS here: [https://solanabeach.io/](https://solanabeach.io/)

Network is open and permission less, so anyone can be a validators, there are no min stake requirements like eth2, so once you get staked you get a stake weighted portion of the leader schedule for the epoch.

\&gt; Why isn't SOLANA chain technology more KNOWN? Don't like conspiracy theories, so I will just stick to the fact they have made they biggest announcement about their performance on 20th DEC 2020. And because they weren't very known, I guess newspapers, influencers and professionals of the market hasn't heard about it or just sceptical about the legitimate of their claims.

With the recent launch of native SPL USDT on Solana, the ecosystem is phasing out SPL Wrapped USDT (WUSDT). 

If you are currently providing liquidity/farming RAY-WUSDT, you will need to migrate to a new RAY-USDT pool soon. We are working on a migration tool to make the process as straightforward as possible. 

We're also considering to add a WUSDT-to-USDT converter directly into 'Swap' so everyone can simply select the two assets and swap to convert.

The new RAY-USDT pool will go live in approx 24 hrs. Make sure to cancel any open RAY-WUSDT orders you have on the trading DEX page before that.

In regards to other smart contract blockchains, they also have unchecked burdens by not charging for storage rent (this is imo the next scalibility issue, free memory is not sustainable).

,Raketenernie,,,," Thank you very much. Lets get this very clear.  

I want to ask here to the executives to Solana one question. What has changed with Kin that now made you change your initial deal and declining the grant? 

Kin brings right now  exactly the same at the table when the deal was made. In fact right now it brings even more to the table with a 5x higher market cap and even more signifcant legal clarity. 

If the Kin foundation would act in similar way then they should be the ones not getting 1% grant but asking for 2% grant. 

So will there be negotiations ? Was this not a win win situation for both, so if that is true, then I do not understand why the initial staus quo is not applied.

I compared the steps in the # between the two orders and I don't see any differences between them in the steps. In an another one # I see the cancel and later again in an another one the settle funds transaction.

UPDATE: after (like) another hour of searching...

So I started to look step by step through all the single steps with the order creation transaction and checked all the addresses that were used during that creation. While doing this I recognized, the market address raydium for the ray-usdt pair did changed. So I added manually in the url the old one address that was in my order creation # for the market et voil√† suddenly I could see my order! The pair is quoted as RAY/USDT-V2 whatever USDT-V2 now means. So I did all the steps, cancel, settle and all funds now back in my wallet.

However, you need people out there to actually submit 50,000 TPS for there to be that many transactions to even process, and right now there are only about 1,000 transactions per second being submitted (with most of those being votes).

So there is a lot of unused capacity in the Solana network right now.  It will take some time before enough apps and things have been built on Solana for those transaction counts to start creeping up into the tens of thousands.

I don't know anything about DOT.  Does it have a real, functioning, working network right now or is it just another idea waiting to be realized (which for most, never seems to happen)?

I bought 3 bitcoins in 2011.  Should have bought much more but I could see that the transaction rate would never be sufficient to do what people were claiming it would do at the time, which was become a global currency used by end-users everywhere.  So I lost interest.  I sold two of them when they were at $600 apiece, figuring that a 20x return was about the best I could expect.  I still have the last one, which I will hold until it either nets me enough money that I don't need any more, or it becomes worthless.

By the way, in 2011 I was also really concerned with the 'bitcoin founder' holding millions of BTC that he/she/they minted in the first year or two before bitcoin was even public.  I thought, why would I get involved in a currency where one single entity already owns most of it?  Unfortunately I did not realize that most/all of that bitcoin was lost, the private keys probably never even stored but thrown away immediately.  Surely if they were kept someone would have sold some of those bitcoin by now.

My point being, my understanding back then of the early mover advantage - I thought I had already missed the boat on Bitcoin in 2011, not realize that *I* was the early mover - really cost me a lot.

False,etan1,,,,"In my opinion, PoW is a dead end. The energy consumption is directly related to the market cap. Higher market cap &gt; higher block reward &gt; more mining farms until block reward only slightly above electricity cost &gt; bad for environment. It is only a matter of time until PoW based approaches need to be banned on a regulatory level for this reason alone. On top of it, it leads to scarce markets (Nvidia GPUs) which is a problem economically. Furthermore, the larger the mining farms need to be, the more it centralizes the entire operation, removing the security aspect as well because the few single miners can decide when to double spend etc. It may be a dead end, but PoS will eventually be more secure IMO. 

In ETH1 they sort of manage it for now by lowering block rewards every now and then to adjust for market cap, but that only works because they can sort of centrally update things like reward rates via network updates ‚Äì the blockchain itself does not use $ price as a factor to compute mining rewards.

Other PoW approaches like IOTA also dont convince me as it basically requires users of the network to burn the energy to make transactions. A battery powered IoT device should not need to do any computations more than necessary, such as PoW computations, just to do a tx.

With Solana, I like that Proof of History only seems to require a single CPU to continuously burn cycles to compute SHA hashes. As long as this is only required to be done by the validator, and not by the end device as well, thats about the only acceptable ‚ÄúPoW‚Äù style approach (doing busy computations constantly) that does not grow with market cap.

,TangeloNightmare,founder,,Eric (Co-Founder),"Thanks for the question u/Omisebro, I think some of the confusion may just be terminology. Let me try to clarify

&gt;I was intrigued by Solana and it‚Äôs team, but when I read it was using a derivative of DPoS and PBFT I was pretty disappointed. From my understanding PBFT l doesn‚Äôt scale well at all with additional nodes, which means there will need to be white-listed nodes to keep scalability reasonable. Even PoH (while smart and cool) is just an incremental improvement and doesn‚Äôt result in a revolutionary iteration of BFT that solves it‚Äôs inherent terrible scalability with added nodes

Actually PoH does address this side effect of traditional PBFT. It separates the time component from the consensus component. I.e. in traditional PBFT, the network proceeds (time) in a lock-step fashion, each step requiring the network to come to consensus, so the bottleneck, wrt to progression, is the network communication overhead necessary to agree on the ordering of the transactions to come to consensus. This means that more nodes --&gt; more communication --&gt; more time to consensus --&gt; scaling problems. This is, in effect, one of the main drivers of the ""inherent terrible scalability with added nodes"" you refer to (another component is the data propagation component, PoH helps here too and you can read about how [here](https://solana.com/turbine/) if interested).

PoH (i.e. the data structure of the Solana blockchain) provides a cryptographically verifiable sense of ordering to the messages, so nodes that receive the PoH data stream can trust/verify the ordering of the transactions on their own, without the node, and the network, having to put the breaks on transaction processing to wait for the rest of the nodes to agree on an ordering before continuing. So if I'm a Solana node, I can keep processing/validating transactions that are being broadcast from the rotating leaders ""optimistically"", without having the start/stop nature of traditional PBFT.  In the language of the [CAP theorem](https://towardsdatascience.com/cap-theorem-and-distributed-database-management-systems-5c2be977950e), you might say that Solana is an 'availability/liveness' preferring chain, rather than traditional PBFT which leans toward 'consistency'. 

Our consensus mechanism ([TowerBFT](https://solana.com/tower-bft/)), is then layered on top of this - resolving forks that may arise rather than being the limiting factor in network progression.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So it seems from the documentation that stake will be delegated to nodes (how many will be on mainnet? 21?) so these delegators get to choose who is whitelisted? Even then what dies Solana have in place to prevent the alleged cartels that have formed in EOS?

I think this may be where some of the terminology confusion comes in. Perhaps DPOS isn't the correct terminology (has EOS fully appropriated this terminology?).  We allow delegation of stake to validators -  while at the same time our validator network is fully permissionless (in fact, with our incentivized testnet just about to kick off, you should feel free to [spin a validator node up yourself](https://solana-labs.github.io/book-edge/testnet-participation.html)). 

To be clear: there is no whitelist for validators/delegators on our network.  On mainnet, anyone can become a validator, accept delegations, earn rewards, etc.

We've done test of the network, spinning up 200 GPU nodes across multiple regions for benchmarking purposes (50ktps!), but there are no (lower or upper) requirements on the number of mainnet nodes. We expect the number of mainnet nodes to be driven more by the economics of the validation ecosystem :)",True,False,0,1569050646,,False,0,f0xwjo8,False,t3_d6it97,True,t3_d6it97,/r/solana/comments/d6it97/how_does_solana_intend_to_prevent_validator/f0xwjo8/,,1577308424.0,3,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,dark,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Eric (Co-Founder)'}]",richtext,1524159918.0,t2_17wvk126,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,[],0.0,,,,False,,,,,,,

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"Maybe a misnomer but I think of it being 'centralized' in the sense of it still relying quite heavily on a single group - the Solana Foundation, run by the original founders - to keep it going.  It is not out of beta yet because it still does not support at least one absolutely critical feature - slashing - and without the support of the founders bringing out new software and slowly coaxing the network to life, it would not be self-sustaining (in my opinion).  There is a chance that it's already self-sustaining because enough validators may stick around indefinitely to keep it working, but without slashing and some other features, it is in a very precarious position.

Slashing is what is supposed to keep validators honest.  Right now there is nothing keeping them honest other than ... well ... honesty on the part of the validators.  A validator could violate the rules and nothing bad would happen.

EXCEPT that I think that it's probably likely that the foundation would have some way to manually slash a bad actor via a software release.  This is a way in which it is currently centralized: all of the algorithms and processes that are supposed to be built into Solana to make it secure and complete are not there yet, and everyone is depending on one central entity to bring those things online.  In that sense, it is controlled by that entity and thus centralized in a fashion.

However, once all the features are in place, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be considered a decentralized network.  There is still the power of the software authors, but maybe someday there will be an alternate implementation of the validators and at that point there won't even be a single entity controlling the software that the network runs.",True,,0,1614917121,,False,0,gpqjpja,False,t3_ly35i7,False,t3_ly35i7,/r/solana/comments/ly35i7/why_do_competitors_keep_calling_solana_centralized/gpqjpja/,,,18,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gpqjpja,1627123935.0,

I compared the steps in the # between the two orders and I don't see any differences between them in the steps. In an another one # I see the cancel and later again in an another one the settle funds transaction.

UPDATE: after (like) another hour of searching...

So I started to look step by step through all the single steps with the order creation transaction and checked all the addresses that were used during that creation. While doing this I recognized, the market address raydium for the ray-usdt pair did changed. So I added manually in the url the old one address that was in my order creation # for the market et voil√† suddenly I could see my order!

2. The money raised has went to incredible developments. Its not Kin's fault that they got hit with the lawsuit and had to dig themselves out of the whole. I applaud them for not laying down and fighting back at the SEC.

Perhaps part of the confusion here is that some people seem to be asking questions about the fundamental design and expected ultimate outcome, and others are focusing on the current partial realization of that design.

Ultimately there is no central authority because someone else could come along with better software and take mindshare of validators and create a duopoly of control.  Repeat the process and eventually there is a plurality of vendors providing software and therefore influencing the overall workings of the network.

I don't think there has ever been nor will ever be any kind of system like this that wasn't highly ""centralized"" (if that's the term we're choosing to describe this) at the outset and centralized to some degree even after that.  Bitcoin for example was highly dependent on the original source code base and I'm pretty sure that the cabal of developers who were working on it early on were the centralized authority of bitcoin.  I didn't follow the history very closely (stopped watching in 2011 when it was clear that bitcoin would never scale) but there was a split with bitcoin cash wasn't there?  Imagine if all the developers had agreed with the changes that BCH wanted to make.  Then I am 100% confident that there would have been no split, just a change in the bitcoin protocol enforced via mindshare of the majority of bitcoin developers, and following from them everyone who took the bitcoin software.  That's exactly what you're calling a ""central authority"".  They are unavoidable.

However, even the ""central authority"" doesn't have complete control.  Anyone can come along and erode that authority if they can make better software that validators want to take.

And I would expect Solana to evolve in that direction, where the foundation is actively working to reduce their own authority by adding more automated mechanisms to the Solana protocol that don't rely or even accept any central oversight.  Slashing is an interesting example.  I don't know how they are thinking to decentralize it.  Allow validators to propose a slash and then have all the other validators vote on it?  Seems most logical.  Maybe the slash proposal would have a URL in it where the validator proposing the slash could lay out their case?

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree.  The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0% commission, like Everstake.

I also agree that no-commission validation is not sustainable.  These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base.  I don't quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though, given that they've attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere. 

I run a validator and I have 8% commission which I think is pretty close to the average.

Within a given commission range, you can also look at the total number of votes being cast, since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting.  Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible, then the overall take will be as large as possible (but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers).

On validators.app, you can see this in the ""Skipped Vote % (distance from leader)"" metric.  The closer to 0, the better (so -0.40% is better than -1.0%), because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer.

So basically there are two factors: how close to optimally the validator is voting (represented by very small skipped vote %) and what commission the validator is taking.  Of the two, unless the skipped vote % is very high, the commission will make the larger difference.

My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0.25% of the very best (represented by values like -0.24% on validators.app).  But I charge 8% commission.

Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network - it makes it more centralized and reduces its security.  So if you want to do what's best for Solana itself, you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators.  Maybe something like 3/4 of your stake on big low-fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators?

That's what I did when I started.  I picked 6 - two in the top 10, two in the 10 - 30 range, and two in the 30 - 100 range (in total stake ranking).  I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission.

I have being doing DD on Solana for weeks and finally got in around $3.50, in for the long term. Admittedly I am a little worried I'm getting in at fully diluted mc of close to $2b but honestly I think it can be much more even. 

A few questions if you'll entertain:
1) when dilution comes (80-90% by eoy?) How does it come on the market? Will they release in a way that takes into account the price action so as to not destroy the technicals, or is it a regular trickling release, or released but locked for certain time, etc? Would like to learn about the mechanics and thinking behind token releases. 

1.1) on August 14, 2020 the MC doubled, is that due to a release in coins? Is there anywhere to check for how/why the MC calculation changed, so one can see record of releases in the past? To an noob, it's weird to see a coins mc go up but price flat. Would also love to learn about thinking behind releasing coins gradually for new tokens as well. 

2) on the tech side, what are some other L1 solutions you think has promise? I have been looking around and honestly cannot find anyone even close to SOL's credibility.

Good to hear from someone that has used AVAX. Felt to me like it came out of nowhere and then all the sudden there are shills for it everywhere.

So far I've just used Serum via SolFlare's DEX, primarily to buy and sell SRM and FTT. The transactions were fast and cheap. Much mo betta than my experience with Uniswap last summer.

,SolanaGoddess,,,,"Reposting my comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/kpjlez/how_solana_plans_to_handle_90_of_the_tokens/).

I'll caveat this by saying I'm not an expert. I'm a crypto professional who's been following the project, reading the transparency reports, and have close friends who work at trading desks and have been accumulating SOL.

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98. Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock?

None of this is investment advice, and I will admit I'm heavily biased as I have accumulated the large, large majority of my portfolio in SOL. But I think over the next few days the market will start to take notice of these facts. TheCryptoDog (with &gt;250k followers) has been tweeting this too: [https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784)

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98. Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock?",True,False,0,1609796145,,False,0,gi3zu3w,False,t3_kq6fh5,True,t1_gi3os9u,/r/solana/comments/kq6fh5/weekly_price_trade_discussion_from_january_4_to/gi3zu3w/,,1620435926.0,1,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,,t2_9mxdgzmc,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

Quick question though please; when you say ""Solana **can** reach over 50k transactions per second while keeping costs to $10 per 1 million transactions."" - let's say the network is only processing 5k TPS at a certain time - does that mean that the lower number of transactions, the higher the per/transaction fee?

i.e; if we say 50k TPS is an ""optimal"" level of transactions per second and equates to the stated  0.00001 $ per transaction - the level of TPS drops to 5k, does the network then start to run at a ""sub-optimal"" level and therefore each transaction will cost more as a result?",True,,0,1613476488,,False,0,gnmz4e1,True,t3_lklazt,True,t1_gnkvud6,/r/solana/comments/lklazt/how_are_transaction_fees_calculated/gnmz4e1/,,,1,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1489160951.0,t2_162s63,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gnmz4e1,1626986491.0,

That page focuses on slashing as a way to enforce the rule that validators are only allowed to vote on one fork for some period of time.  This makes sense because requiring validators to be committed to a fork is the mechanism whereby consensus is created.

However, there is also mention from time to time of more egregious slashing penalties for ""malicious"" validator behavior.  It wasn't made clear in the docs but I'm guessing that this would be done by the 'central authority' who would decide to hard code the slash in code and put it in the next software release.  The validators would then 'vote' for that by taking that version of the software.  Once a majority of validators have done so, the slash is accepted by virtue of being enforced since the slash is now running on the majority of nodes.

This puts a lot of power in the hands of the developers who control the software.  Because I think we can all assume that validators *want* to stay up to date with software releases and so there is *a lot* of inertia built into the system.  Certainly some less than optimal choices by the foundation could be carried through just on that inertia.  This is worrisome.

The comforting part is that the foundation is very motivated to do the right thing, knowing that the entire success of solana depends on validator and end-user mindshare, which would be highly compromised by nefarious actions on the part of the foundation.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I have been pondering the same questions.  A few points:

- I *think*, but do not know, that the Solana Foundation/founders are staking new Validators with about 200,000 SOL token.  If you look at the list of validators from solanabeach.io, you will notice that alot of the 'newer' smaller ones are staked with the same amount in the 200,000 range.  This suggests to me that there is a policy in Solana of doing that at the moment.  Also when I asked a similar question earlier I was told by a co-founder to 'set up a node and sign up for tds and earn a grant'.

- I have done some rough pricing out of the 'medium sized' recommended specs for a validator and it's in the $5,000 - $6,000 range if you include a GPU.  Right now silicon is very hard to come by which is a problem.  Incredibly inflated prices on GPUs, somewhat less but still terrible prices on CPUs.

- I have never colo'd so I don't know how much that costs.  I think that you can do it for less than $400 per month depending on where you are.  You need 1 Gbps fully unmetered which means you need to be in a colo facility.  I think that the only economical way to do that is with a rack mounted unit.  I am not an expert in rack mounted systems and from my research the simplest way to do it is with 4U form factor since you can fit basically stock PC parts in.

- I do not know what you mean by ""I'm in the US, so unfortunately unable to earn foundation rewards"".  I say that because I actually don't know anything, not because I am challenging what you say.  In what way are US citizens hamstrung with regards to the Solana foundation?  I sincerely do not know and would appreciate any info you have ...

As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.  Then maybe upgrade a few components into the minimum viable voting node and try that for a while.  And then if the economics are working, jump into a full node for the $many thousands that takes to set up.

I also encourage anyone with actual experience to share on this thread.

I think part of the reason that people are likely hesitant to share, however, is that existing validators do not want competition.  They want the ecosystem to only be healthy enough with enough validators to do the job, and no more than that, because more validators than strictly necessary just cuts into their profits.

EDIT: By the way, just keep in mind that if you don't risk anything, then you cannot hope for any rewards.  A few thousands of dollars risk is nothing compared to the potential payoff, but you do have to be prepared to lose some thousands and chalk it up to a moon shot that didn't work if it fails.",True,,0,1614192920,,1614193127.0,0,gom4l1x,False,t3_lrjr6l,False,t3_lrjr6l,/r/solana/comments/lrjr6l/validator_node_economics/gom4l1x/,,,4,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gom4l1x,1627047436.0,

Whereas other blockchains require validators to talk to one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF)

There are a total of 8 core innovations that allow the Solana network to operate at such speeds with sub-second confirmation times: [https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda)",True,False,0,1600974466,,False,0,g6ge2zy,False,t3_iz2l0q,False,t3_iz2l0q,/r/solana/comments/iz2l0q/solanas_consensus_algorithm/g6ge2zy/,,1613243462.0,6,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,,t2_48o4a4e8,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

At this point that stake account is earning ~4,000 SOL every three days.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"Solana has been tested to actually achieve 50,000 TPS on real hardware and networks.  However, you need people out there to actually submit 50,000 TPS for there to be that many transactions to even process, and right now there are only about 1,000 transactions per second being submitted (with most of those being votes).

So there is a lot of unused capacity in the Solana network right now.  It will take some time before enough apps and things have been built on Solana for those transaction counts to start creeping up into the tens of thousands.

I don't know anything about DOT.  Does it have a real, functioning, working network right now or is it just another idea waiting to be realized (which for most, never seems to happen)?

I bought 3 bitcoins in 2011.  Should have bought much more but I could see that the transaction rate would never be sufficient to do what people were claiming it would do at the time, which was become a global currency used by end-users everywhere.  So I lost interest.  I sold two of them when they were at $600 apiece, figuring that a 20x return was about the best I could expect.  I still have the last one, which I will hold until it either nets me enough money that I don't need any more, or it becomes worthless.

By the way, in 2011 I was also really concerned with the 'bitcoin founder' holding millions of BTC that he/she/they minted in the first year or two before bitcoin was even public.  I thought, why would I get involved in a currency where one single entity already owns most of it?  Unfortunately I did not realize that most/all of that bitcoin was lost, the private keys probably never even stored but thrown away immediately.  Surely if they were kept someone would have sold some of those bitcoin by now.

My point being, my understanding back then of the early mover advantage - I thought I had already missed the boat on Bitcoin in 2011, not realize that *I* was the early mover - really cost me a lot.  I am hoping not to make that same mistake with Solana.  Even though I missed the true early mover period (having been aware of this for years now but not even bothering to get involved until recently) I accept that I am still an early mover and will stick with it.",True,,0,1617060799,,1617061058.0,0,gsqsvjn,False,t3_mfyoqj,False,t3_mfyoqj,/r/solana/comments/mfyoqj/1000_tps_on_a_coin_thats_barely_used_for_now_with/gsqsvjn/,,,6,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gsqsvjn,1627306514.0,

Currently, there are what I consider to be 4 major groups of validators:

(1). The big guns.  This is almost everyone in the top 12 - 15.  These validators have many millions staked to them and usually are quite professional organizations who have made a business of staking.  They are great choices from a reliability standpoint, but many do not offer particularly great commission.  A few offer very low or zero commission, but this will not last (although you might as well take advantage of it while you can right?!).  HOWEVER, these are already the most-staked validators which means that staking to them is kinda bad for the network.  So if you really want to do what is best for Solana you will only stake *some* of your tokens there, and spread the rest lower.

(2). The middle-of-the-pack: these are larger although not nearly as large as the big ones, and they range from like around 300,000 stake through 3 or 4 million stake.  I think that most are still quite well run - they seem to be just as reliable as the largest ones, and I've been waching very closely for a couple of weeks.  There are maybe 20 - 30 validators to pick in this range.   I think that all of them would be a fine choice.  Be aware though that many in the 1.5 - 3.5 million stake range are actually in what I am calling category 3, but these are obvious as category 3 has 100% commission so you would never want to stake with them anyway (as you'd make 0%, and they'd make 100%, off of your stake).

(3). There is some very large whale who appears to be self-staking about 50 million SOL.  It may be a group of whales who got together or something.  Anyway, this is a large group of about 20 validators with 1.5 - 3.5 million SOL staked *each* and a 100% commission.  They don't want your stake.  Don't stake with them.

(4). The Hetzner crowd.  This is a huge number of validators that are almost all located in Hetzner low-cost data centers in Europe.  They are all staked with around 200,000 - 230,000 SOL.  They were staked by the Solana Foundation as part of the program to encourage new validators to start up.  Someone figured out that the cheapest way to do this was to sign up for a 100 Euro monthly plan from Hetzner and start pumping out validators.  I am not saying it's all one person or a small group of people, but I have no doubt that it's a community that together figured out how to run a bunch of validators in Europe for the lowest possible cost.  Literally half of the mainnet validators in existence are these.  I find that they tend to be the least reliable and provide the worst return.  I staked with some of them before I knew much about Solana and they had the worst performance (but still it was only like 1% APY different from my best performance - so not a huge difference -- but you *did* say ""max rewards"", so ...).  As long as the price of SOL stays high, these validators will keep going, but I would imagine that they are the most price-sensitive, because if the price of SOL goes down, they will be the first to become unprofitable and some may stop validating.  I don't know for sure.  All of them I am sure would love to have your stake because they are all competing in a very large pool of over 250 validators with almost no way to differentiate between them.  Also they almost all have high commissions - 10% - which means that because of being overall the least reliable, highest commission, and most concentrated in one data center (Hetzner), they are probably the worst choice for someone looking for ""max value"".

Of course there is a 5th category - small validators with 30,000 or less - some validators having less than 5,000 staked.  I have no idea what these validators are doing since you're almost certainly losing money running a validator at this level of stake.  I wish them luck though ...",True,,0,1616892213,,1616892425.0,0,gsj3jt8,False,t3_meiwg6,False,t1_gshz1dp,/r/solana/comments/meiwg6/choosing_a_validator_for_max_rewards/gsj3jt8/,,,11,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 150, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

Currently, there are what I consider to be 4 major groups of validators:

(1). The big guns.  This is almost everyone in the top 12 - 15.  These validators have many millions staked to them and usually are quite professional organizations who have made a business of staking.  They are great choices from a reliability standpoint, but many do not offer particularly great commission.  A few offer very low or zero commission, but this will not last (although you might as well take advantage of it while you can right?!).  HOWEVER, these are already the most-staked validators which means that staking to them is kinda bad for the network.  So if you really want to do what is best for Solana you will only stake *some* of your tokens there, and spread the rest lower.

(2). The middle-of-the-pack: these are larger although not nearly as large as the big ones, and they range from like around 300,000 stake through 3 or 4 million stake.  I think that most are still quite well run - they seem to be just as reliable as the largest ones, and I've been waching very closely for a couple of weeks.  There are maybe 20 - 30 validators to pick in this range.   I think that all of them would be a fine choice.  Be aware though that many in the 1.5 - 3.5 million stake range are actually in what I am calling category 3, but these are obvious as category 3 has 100% commission so you would never want to stake with them anyway (as you'd make 0%, and they'd make 100%, off of your stake).

(3). There is some very large whale who appears to be self-staking about 50 million SOL.  It may be a group of whales who got together or something.  Anyway, this is a large group of about 20 validators with 1.5 - 3.5 million SOL staked *each* and a 100% commission.  They don't want your stake.  Don't stake with them.

(4). The Hetzner crowd.  This is a huge number of validators that are almost all located in Hetzner low-cost data centers in Europe.  They are all staked with around 200,000 - 230,000 SOL.  They were staked by the Solana Foundation as part of the program to encourage new validators to start up.  Someone figured out that the cheapest way to do this was to sign up for a 100 Euro monthly plan from Hetzner and start pumping out validators.  I am not saying it's all one person or a small group of people, but I have no doubt that it's a community that together figured out how to run a bunch of validators in Europe for the lowest possible cost.  Literally half of the mainnet validators in existence are these.  I find that they tend to be the least reliable and provide the worst return.  I staked with some of them before I knew much about Solana and they had the worst performance (but still it was only like 1% APY different from my best performance - so not a huge difference -- but you *did* say ""max rewards"", so ...).  As long as the price of SOL stays high, these validators will keep going, but I would imagine that they are the most price-sensitive, because if the price of SOL goes down, they will be the first to become unprofitable and some may stop validating.  I don't know for sure.  All of them I am sure would love to have your stake because they are all competing in a very large pool of over 250 validators with almost no way to differentiate between them.  Also they almost all have high commissions - 10% - which means that because of being overall the least reliable, highest commission, and most concentrated in one data center (Hetzner), they are probably the worst choice for someone looking for ""max value"".

Of course there is a 5th category - small validators with 30,000 or less - some validators having less than 5,000 staked.  I have no idea what these validators are doing since you're almost certainly losing money running a validator at this level of stake.  I wish them luck though ...",True,,0,1616892213,,1616892425.0,0,gsj3jt8,False,t3_meiwg6,False,t1_gshz1dp,/r/solana/comments/meiwg6/choosing_a_validator_for_max_rewards/gsj3jt8/,,,11,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 150, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

,JayPBanks,,,,"That‚Äôs not how it works my friend. Market caps are literally based on free market price x tokens. You will see different sources base it off circulating, total, max. 

All you need to worry about (long term) is fully diluted supply x current price. If you think the current state of development is worth less than a max supply cap then it‚Äôs a good buy. 

Here is a good way to understand:
Solana is a layer 1 network, therefore it should be compared against other layer 1s (ETH, XTZ, XLM etc). You also need to factor in network functionality/capability (smart contracts, tx time etc) 

When you compare these networks, you ideally would be looking at all of them fully diluted with current state of development. 

Solana is currently valued at 30% of similar layer 1s. SOL is actually much better technologically than most layer 1s. It is easily worth the same as as many in the top 20.

Tron ($1B) 
Cardano ($2B)
Tezos ($2B)
EOS ($2.5B)
XLM ($1.5B)

In my opinion, Solana is worthy of being in that range. All of those are not even fully diluted for each network. Here is another example:

Algorand is a very comparable network to Solana as far as development, team, functionality etc..

ALGO circulating mcap is $194M but fully diluted is $2.5B. Solana is barely 10% fully diluted to Algorand max mcap but is a very comparable project. So if you‚Äôre buying ALGO at these prices over Solana then you‚Äôre saying it is 10x better fully diluted. This is laughable if anybody truly believes that. 

If you‚Äôre investing long term then you should look at the token distribution relative to when you believe you‚Äôll close your position. All of the networks I named should be valued in the range of $1B-$5B fully diluted mcap. 

Hopefully this helps. I started a financial support group last month to help people understand the complexities here. This is a simplified synopsis and should be taken lightly. Only for perspective. Good luck.

I say that because I actually don't know anything, not because I am challenging what you say.  In what way are US citizens hamstrung with regards to the Solana foundation?  I sincerely do not know and would appreciate any info you have ...

US entities are unable to get SOL rewards for participating in their test net initiatives, like TdS for example (so the recommendation to get started there is useless for me unfortunately). You're able to start up a node on the mainnet, but unless you'd been doing it for a while or had acquired a large amount of SOL, I don't see a realistic way in if you're an individual in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.

I thought about this as well and am mulling it over. Not a bad idea at all. If I recall I think you can get on their testnet to get familiar with it.

a. The fact that there is no comprehensive description of how the system works that can be scrutinized by experts.  There are some high level descriptions available of the various pieces but nothing comprehensive.  I am pretty sure that most of it just evolved in code as the developers figured out how to make it work.  As a result, I don't think anyone can say for sure whether or not there are fundamental weaknesses that haven't been realized yet.

b. It seems to require an awful lot of network communication between peers and not all of the network is decentralized -- there are unique and specific endpoints that most users have to go through.  I suspect that the validators, even though they mostly coordinate through decentralized means, probably still have some dependence on centralized servers for some aspects.  This is concerning because it creates a single point, or small number of points, of potential failure.

c. Many of the 'core' features that seem like they must be necessary to allow the system to work without being shepherded by enthusiasts, and which would be necessary in the face of attack by bad actors, do not seem to exist.  For example, slashing, which would be necessary to provide negative feedback to prevent attempts at double spends and such, are just placeholders with promises that ""we think it will probably work"", but as far as I can tell, no implementation at all.  So there are fundamental parts that are incomplete and I think the whole thing is working only because initial adopters, early enthusiasts, and the founders are working hard to keep everything going despite the whole thing not being complete yet.

d. This is not a concern about Solana itself but it is a concern just about the value of SOL tokens, which is only of interest to anyone hoping to 'get rich' off of early adoption.  SOL are not difficult to generate (that's the whole point of PoS over PoW) relative to the value that they provide.  The only reason to buy a SOL is to use it to pay for some transactions, but when transactions are very very cheap, you don't need to buy much SOL.  I think Bitcoin has shown that you don't actually need to be able to do anything *practically useful* with a cryptocurrency for people to place short term value on it (my theory is that its value goes to 0 when coins can no longer be minted and the only way for miners to make money is on transactions that people have no need to or desire to engage in), but when there is no (or very limited) artificial scarcity as in SOL, I do not know if utility is enough to give it much 'hype value'.  It's going up continuously right now but I don't know if that's because of clever pumping by whales, overall cryptocurrency hype, or actual interest by a large number of people.  I suspect it's a combination of all three but I don't know the exact ratios.",True,,0,1614187211,,1614187406.0,0,golpazt,False,t3_lrdnhm,False,t3_lrdnhm,/r/solana/comments/lrdnhm/solana_has_me_intrigued/golpazt/,,,10,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_golpazt,1627046834.0,
,danr00,,,,"So, you've got a right to be worried, things do look rather precarious. If you're chasing a token you can ride from rank &gt;100 all the way through to top 10, I can see why Solana might seem pointless, as the ship appears to have already sailed. Despite the fact there's a transparency report (cute name) what's going to happen post 7th of Jan, isn't really known yet (to us at least). Truth be told, it does look like a bitconnect level meme silently gestating.

Just some things to consider:

* People in the project; There are names / faces / reputations that are tied to this project, they are real people, with real credentials, I'm not sure if this means much to you, but to me it means culpability if things do go wrong.
* The project itself; have you actually tried to transact using sol? have a go, download a wallet on your phone / pc and send some between two devices, it's near instant, which is impressive for a token that also handles smart contacts.
* The investments; Obviously a double edged sword, but, initial investors are what helped this token exist in the first place, this also helps with marketing (which some tokens / coins sorely miss)
* Connections; Binance is on board, there is also a connection with Coinbase (see: Staking via Coinbase custody), whether this manifests into something like a listing or not, remains to be seen.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"There are efforts currently underway to create what are called ""stake pools"".  These are going to be a network-supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its SOL to validators.  The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right.  It's sort of a second layer of staking, where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security.

I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months.

Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster - 'stake boss' is a thing soon to be released (from what I have read) by Block Logic, the company that does validators.app.  Stake Boss is not a true stake pool - there is no token created to represent membership, it's a much more direct mechanism where you simply re-assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security.  In this case you're basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you, that manager being Stake Boss.  It's similar to what stake pools will be in practice.

Keep in mind that it's not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top; if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing, you may be fine with that.  You're basically paying to have your stake managed, which is a perfectly valid service that you may find worth the cost.

Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools (and possibly Stake Boss, although I don't know Block Logic's exact plans, only they know) will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around.  Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know, some may spread only a little bit, it will be up to how the pool is managed.

So when those come online, there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage.

If you are not in the USA, then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators -- it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the ""Tour de SOL"" whereby they prove the quality of their systems, and once they pass all the hurdles, then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225,000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself.  More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program.  However, this is only available to non-US participants, and it also only happens occasionally, and furthermore, I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators.

I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through ""connections"".  The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL.  Those institutional investors don't even seem to care that much about the quality of validation - the highest stake validator, Chorus One, was down for more than 9 hours last epoch, which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators - and yet Chorus One didn't lose any stake because of it, instead they seem to just be gaining more ...

So to some degree, stake begets more stake, which makes it even harder for those trying to enter.  You are going to have to rely on connections, if you have them, and handouts from the foundation and stake pools, if and when those become available.

Once you have some stake and are in the system, you can then try to attract more, with lower commission, better service, better returns, additional services offered, and ... marketing.  Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists.  This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention.  We'll see ....

p.s. if you are considering running a validator, you may want to consult my spreadsheet of expected Validator returns.  You will have to make a copy of the sheet to be able to edit the values, but it will allow you to play with the numbers, put in what you might expect to achieve ... it calculates expected profit and also calculates what the amount of SOL you'd have to have staked to your validator is in order to break even.

,PlantD0ctor,,,,"I started following Solana because of the initial leak and disclosure of the deal between Kin and Sol. My thesis was that Sol would gain significant credibility for their POH approach if it could demonstrate the real world transaction volumes provided by Kin. This would provide a very real win win for both Kin and Sol. Based on this I increased my position in Kin and bought into Sol. 

From the outside looking in, it does seem as though Sol has acted in bad faith and not lived up to the spirit of the agreement that they had with Kin. That said, I sincerely hope that there is something going on behind closed doors that explains everything that has transpired.

I see this happen alot - people mix things that are true and verifiable, with things that are theoretical and not implemented, and it causes a lot of confusion.

Inflation is implemented and happening right now.  It's around 8% per year, and will reduce a little bit each year, until it hits a constant 1.5% in about 11 years.  Here is all the details on that:

https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/ed_overview/ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_protocol_based_rewards

Slashing - the mechanism for punishing validators who break the rules - is NOT implemented.  It's all theory right now.

The only concrete thing that slashing has been proposed to be used for is for punishing validators who break the voting rules -- the rules are that validators are not supposed to 'switch forks' for a certain amount of time after voting on a fork (if there are two forks and a validator chooses to vote on fork A and not B, then that validator is committed to only voting on fork A for a certain period of time; if the validator wants to switch to fork B because it believes that fork has become the better fork, it must wait to do so but not voting on fork A for a while until it has satisfied the waiting period, then it can switch to voting on fork B; this is to provide the mechanism that forces validators to commit to forks which then allows forks to win or lose; if every validator voted on every fork, then no fork would ever die and there would just be more and more forks).

But there is noting right now preventing a validator from breaking those rules and voting on multiple forks at once.  In fact, validators are kind of economically incentivized to do so because they will be guaranteed to get more votes in, which makes more money.  As far as I know, validators are currently being honest and following the fork voting rules; but if they are doing so, it's just out of honesty.  There is no penalty for being dishonest, because there is no slashing implemented.  (Also, i would take expertise and work to modify the validator code to allow this kind of multi-fork voting, and nobody with the time and expertise has been motivated to do that, as far as I know.)

Then there are nebulous claims that slashing could be implemented to deal with provably malicious validators - for example a validator which can be shown to have tried to consistently cheat with false transactions or something like that, or which has a pattern of creating unnecessary forks so flagrantly that it must be malicious, etc.  The mechanism for this slashing has never been fully explained, just hinted at.  But because deciding on guilt would involve some degree of human judgement, it's hard to see how this would happen without the Solana Foundation just coding the slash directly into the validator code and convincing all the validators to accept that new software that enforces the slash.  The foundation has great power here because most validators will just blindly go along with whatever the foundation says, and will install whatever new version of the validator software the foundation makes.

If this all seems a little unsatisfactory to you, then we're in agreement.  I think the foundation needs to implement a mechanism for automated slashing of validators who violate vote rules.  But I guess this will take some time.

In the meantime, talking about slashing like it exists now, is misleading.",True,,0,1617939209,,1617939557.0,0,gtw4bnz,False,t3_mn27en,False,t1_gtvsl39,/r/solana/comments/mn27en/new_to_solana/gtw4bnz/,,,9,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtw4bnz,1628361439.0,False

What will Solana talk about in this Webinar?
It will be a recap on DeFi. 
But, what is DeFi?
Decentralized Finance (or more simply DeFi) refers to an ecosystem of financial applications developed on the basis of network blockchain. 

More precisely, the term Decentralized Finance can refer to a movement that aims to create an ecosystem of financial services open source, permissionless and transparent, which is available to all and operates without any central authority. Users would retain full control of their assets, interacting with this ecosystem through decentralized (dapp) peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I have been pondering the same questions.  A few points:

- I *think*, but do not know, that the Solana Foundation/founders are staking new Validators with about 200,000 SOL token.  If you look at the list of validators from solanabeach.io, you will notice that alot of the 'newer' smaller ones are staked with the same amount in the 200,000 range.  This suggests to me that there is a policy in Solana of doing that at the moment.  Also when I asked a similar question earlier I was told by a co-founder to 'set up a node and sign up for tds and earn a grant'.

- I have done some rough pricing out of the 'medium sized' recommended specs for a validator and it's in the $5,000 - $6,000 range if you include a GPU.  Right now silicon is very hard to come by which is a problem.  Incredibly inflated prices on GPUs, somewhat less but still terrible prices on CPUs.

- I have never colo'd so I don't know how much that costs.  I think that you can do it for less than $400 per month depending on where you are.  You need 1 Gbps fully unmetered which means you need to be in a colo facility.  I think that the only economical way to do that is with a rack mounted unit.  I am not an expert in rack mounted systems and from my research the simplest way to do it is with 4U form factor since you can fit basically stock PC parts in.

- I do not know what you mean by ""I'm in the US, so unfortunately unable to earn foundation rewards"".  I say that because I actually don't know anything, not because I am challenging what you say.  In what way are US citizens hamstrung with regards to the Solana foundation?  I sincerely do not know and would appreciate any info you have ...

As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.  Then maybe upgrade a few components into the minimum viable voting node and try that for a while.  And then if the economics are working, jump into a full node for the $many thousands that takes to set up.

I also encourage anyone with actual experience to share on this thread.

I think part of the reason that people are likely hesitant to share, however, is that existing validators do not want competition.  They want the ecosystem to only be healthy enough with enough validators to do the job, and no more than that, because more validators than strictly necessary just cuts into their profits.

EDIT: By the way, just keep in mind that if you don't risk anything, then you cannot hope for any rewards.  A few thousands of dollars risk is nothing compared to the potential payoff, but you do have to be prepared to lose some thousands and chalk it up to a moon shot that didn't work if it fails.",True,,0,1614192920,,1614193127.0,0,gom4l1x,False,t3_lrjr6l,False,t3_lrjr6l,/r/solana/comments/lrjr6l/validator_node_economics/gom4l1x/,,,4,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gom4l1x,1627047436.0,

Cool. I want to ask you about blockchain's space cost: With Bitcoin, in order to occupy space on the blockchain (store transactions), you have to pay a high fee because you only have 1MB every 10 minutes (or a little more if everyone used Segwit) of space available.

Here I am NOT talking about ""deep"" decentralization arguments like ""blockchain has to remain small in order for everyone to download it"" because as long as there are even few thousands of nodes distributed around the globe that can operate I can't see any real threat.

I am talking about the possibility of an eventual attacker to, relatively cheaply, occupy disk space on nodes.

And maybe I didn't get how Solana works at all, but even 50k of legit transactions per second looks a lot to be stored. How much is the average transaction size? (I can't find this info, along with the actual blockchain size too).

And the supply is only going to keep increasing due to inflation.

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).  I don't mind at the outset where they are using that SOL as leverage to build the ecosystem (via rewards and staking grants, and eventually staking pool grants).

False,nossocc,,,,"I think Solana is a very promising project. In my opinion a problem with the crypto space is that a lot of the community and developers are quite new engineers. Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?"" I don't know. But in terms of a long term investment in my opinion Solana is solid, it's just that right now it's probably overvalued like everything else.

The fact that Solana only proves relative time is no problem for the application I envision. 

Let us say we have the following configuration:

1) Both the device that will be challenged, and the challenging hardware are controlled by the attacker

2) the attacker also controls the local Solana node that is physically close to the device to be challenged. The fact it is part of the Solana network and cannot let bad behavior be detected limits its options, but it still has options.

3) the challenge hardware takes PoH Hash N as input into its challenge query data, and stores the response from the device as a user-generated hash in PoH hash N+1.

I was wondering whether an upper bound on time could be observed and validated by the Solana ledger. In my example above, I am looking for a way for the remote validators to put a cap on Delta T\_max, in [this schematic](https://imgur.com/a/NtRr62e). 

The dashed vertical lines are ""synchronization"" lines (I did not read the white paper in detail yet, so I am just postulating there is such a mechanism), the small red lines are individual PoH hashes, nodes 1 and 2 are ""honest"" nodes, and node 3 runs faster first, to get ahead a little, then gives extra time to the device to compute a counterfeit response to the challenge, and resumes fast hashing to meet the next synchronization deadline.

I am looking for a way where the challenge response validators would only accept the response to the challenge if some conditions, allowing to cap Delta T Max, are met. 

In other words, how could the local Solana node reliably prove to the network that the challenge response was made with a Delta T\_max of less than, say, 1 ¬µs?

The point is to give strong assurance to the network that the external device did not have enough time to forge a counterfeit response before the challenge data became obsolete, and therefore, that it had to use the honest way to answer, as it would be the only way to submit an answer in time.

Two Possible Scenarios

The first scenario - If the price will continue its unstoppable surge then, it may reach up to $4.5 -$5 in no time after the potential test of the recent resistance that turns into support around 32,500- 33,000sats on a daily chart. From there, we need to see the price to rebound.

The second scenario - If the price will follow the Elliot wave count.

,DigitalInstincts,founder,,Raj (Co-Founder),"Hey! I'm the Solana Labs COO, Raj Gokal. Thanks for the question! I'll get right to the answer:

Solana is completely open. Any validators can join the network. It's a PoS system called ""[Tower BFT](https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79)"" based on pBFT, but delegation is an option for any token holders. You can see a list of all the current validators, their performance, and stake weights at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io), and even go become a validator by dropping into the [validator docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator).

There is no maximum number of nodes that the network can manage or will allow. There will never be a limit to the number of nodes that can join. The network is completely open and permissionless, and always will be.

Our block propagation protocol ""[Turbine](https://medium.com/solana-labs/turbine-solanas-block-propagation-protocol-solves-the-scalability-trilemma-2ddba46a51db)"" allows for a ""logarithmic"" increase of finality times with the number of nodes. This means the network *does* slow down a bit with every new node, but *decreasingly* so with every successive node. We expect to see confirmation times in the sub-second range through tens of thousands of nodes.

SOL projects are just in that early phase and simply not fully built out yet.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"The validators with 0% commission are running at a loss right now trying to gather stake.  It is also possible that they own a lot of SOL on their own and run their own validator.  In that case, it doesn't matter what commission they choose because all the SOL is going to go to themselves anyway.  So maybe they then choose 0% in hopes of attracting some stake that they can take advantage of someday.

At any rate, validators with 0% commission will eventually raise it once they have collected enough stake so that they can finally make some SOL.  So don't expect 0% commission to last.  Forbole is a good example - they were 0% commission for a while and just switched to 9% commission.

The reason for a large number of 10% commission validators is because a lot of them were started by people taking advantage of the Solana Foundation passing out stake as part of a program to attract new validators.  I suspect the foundation put a requirement that these validators charge no more than 10% commission, and most of them chose to go with the maximum to get the most SOL out of the foundation stake delegation.  They are all probably aware that they have little chance of attracting other stake but they started a validator knowing that the compromise was that they'd get guaranteed stake from the foundation and are happy to just make the most they can off of that.

In the ranges of commission between 0% and 10%, you have a variety of commissions chosen by each validator to try to maximize their growth while at the same time maximizing current SOL take where they can get it.  Everyone has their own way to decide what the best commission is.

I have tracked the gains on several stake accounts and sampled a lot of data.  It turns out that the difference between 0% commission and 8% commission is only about 1% difference in yearly earnings on stake.  So it actually doesn't even matter all that much what the commission is -- unless you are super concerned with every last percent of return.  You have to balance the needs of the Solana network (spreading stake to some validators with a slightly higher commission) against your desire to earn the absolute best possible return (down to a 1% difference).",True,,0,1617212091,,False,0,gsxqpxd,False,t3_mh3tdu,True,t3_mh3tdu,/r/solana/comments/mh3tdu/delegate_to_who/gsxqpxd/,,,2,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gsxqpxd,1627317391.0,

Just some things to consider:

* People in the project; There are names / faces / reputations that are tied to this project, they are real people, with real credentials, I'm not sure if this means much to you, but to me it means culpability if things do go wrong.
* The project itself; have you actually tried to transact using sol? have a go, download a wallet on your phone / pc and send some between two devices, it's near instant, which is impressive for a token that also handles smart contacts.
* The investments; Obviously a double edged sword, but, initial investors are what helped this token exist in the first place, this also helps with marketing (which some tokens / coins sorely miss)
* Connections; Binance is on board, there is also a connection with Coinbase (see: Staking via Coinbase custody), whether this manifests into something like a listing or not, remains to be seen.
* It's Chad Ethereum
* Consistent announcements

False,GhettoCryptoz,volunteer,,Dom (Volunteer Mod),"Here‚Äôs my understanding to date, I'm only assisting with community moderation. Not actually part of the team. But here goes: 

In it‚Äôs simplest form Proof of History (PoH) is a clock for blockchain.

However, unlike traditional methods where messages within the network are timestamped. Proof of History is a methodology to prove whether a certain message occurred sometime before or after an event. 

For example ‚Äì when you take a selfie with yourself and a newspaper article in it. You are essentially creating proof that your photograph was taken AFTER the newspaper was published. This is exactly what Proof of History does ‚Äì it enables the network to create a historical record to prove that a specific event occurred at a specific moment of time. You can learn more about PoH here: 

And it can do so in an objective, and decentralised manner. 

What does this mean in layman‚Äôs terms? 
Well this essentially means that nodes downstream can then verify the time and order of events within the network WITHOUT witnessing them directly. 

It‚Äôs important to note that PoH is NOT a consensus protocol. It instead adds valuable data (an objective measure of time) to the blockchain.                                                                                   

By adding this valuable data, it allows Solana to optimize other elements of the system without compromising key features or security. Some of these features include ‚ÄúAvalanche‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of Replication‚Äù, and together they allow Solana to achieve sub-second finality and maintain high throughput with minimal loss in finality time - even after the number of nodes on the network increase substantially. 

* Proof of Replication - To get slightly technical on how PoH allows Solana to optimize Proof of Replication (PoRep) by having a sense of time on the blokckchain, the network then doesn‚Äôt need to re-order the CBC blocks. Traditional systems, have to re-order the blocks because they don‚Äôt have an agreed sense of time, and this process is typically expensive. 
* Avalanche - I won‚Äôt get into the technical details of Avalanche ‚Äì and I‚Äôll let you learn from the master himself (the CTO of Solana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=144s

Quick question though please; when you say ""Solana **can** reach over 50k transactions per second while keeping costs to $10 per 1 million transactions."" - let's say the network is only processing 5k TPS at a certain time - does that mean that the lower number of transactions, the higher the per/transaction fee?

i.e; if we say 50k TPS is an ""optimal"" level of transactions per second and equates to the stated  0.00001 $ per transaction - the level of TPS drops to 5k, does the network then start to run at a ""sub-optimal"" level and therefore each transaction will cost more as a result?",True,,0,1613476488,,False,0,gnmz4e1,True,t3_lklazt,True,t1_gnkvud6,/r/solana/comments/lklazt/how_are_transaction_fees_calculated/gnmz4e1/,,,1,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1489160951.0,t2_162s63,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gnmz4e1,1626986491.0,

,DigitalInstincts,founder,,Raj (Co-Founder),"Hey! I'm the Solana Labs COO, Raj Gokal. Thanks for the question! I'll get right to the answer:

Solana is completely open. Any validators can join the network. It's a PoS system called ""[Tower BFT](https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79)"" based on pBFT, but delegation is an option for any token holders. You can see a list of all the current validators, their performance, and stake weights at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io), and even go become a validator by dropping into the [validator docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator).

There is no maximum number of nodes that the network can manage or will allow. There will never be a limit to the number of nodes that can join. The network is completely open and permissionless, and always will be.

Our block propagation protocol ""[Turbine](https://medium.com/solana-labs/turbine-solanas-block-propagation-protocol-solves-the-scalability-trilemma-2ddba46a51db)"" allows for a ""logarithmic"" increase of finality times with the number of nodes. This means the network *does* slow down a bit with every new node, but *decreasingly* so with every successive node. We expect to see confirmation times in the sub-second range through tens of thousands of nodes.

You can learn more about the 8 innovations that make this all possible, including Turbine and Tower BFT, [here](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda)!",True,False,0,1591931859,,False,0,ftrn90q,False,t3_h0xv1d,True,t3_h0xv1d,/r/solana/comments/h0xv1d/solana_open_consensus/ftrn90q/,,1597793936.0,2,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,dark,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Raj (Co-Founder)'}]",richtext,1459515207.0,t2_wsxfq,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,True,[],,,,,,

My point is, if you are investing long term, then short term price due to token releases should not matter. If you want a short term option, then Solana may not be the best choice. Everybody has different metrics they look at. Most people do not understand the underlying dynamics so if the open market is buying a token with low liquidity then the price will go far past it‚Äôs actually value. 

Then you also need to factor in market manipulation, liquidity, tokenomics etc..

2. Verifiers respond as fast as they can.  this is where the leader can basically pick and choose their favorite verifiers and do some censorship up until 2/3+1 majority requirement.  but, so can every leader, and everyones ""choice"" of censorship is encoded into the chain.

,SolanaLabs,,,,"Hey! Happy to help explain. Solana is a PoS network that uses an innovation called 'Proof of History' before consensus to reach speeds of 50,000 tps +. Proof of History (PoH) is a globally-available, permissionless source of time in the network that works before consensus. POH is not a consensus protocol or anti-Sybil mechanism. Rather, POH is a solution to the clock problem.

Whereas other blockchains require validators to talk to one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF)

There are a total of 8 core innovations that allow the Solana network to operate at such speeds with sub-second confirmation times: [https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda)",True,False,0,1600974466,,False,0,g6ge2zy,False,t3_iz2l0q,False,t3_iz2l0q,/r/solana/comments/iz2l0q/solanas_consensus_algorithm/g6ge2zy/,,1613243462.0,6,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,,t2_48o4a4e8,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,,,

For delegators this means:

Do not delegate to a single validator, spread your SOL across multiple.
Do not delegate to the validators who already have enough power to stop the network (scroll down https://solanabeach.io/validators, it has a line showing how many validators make up the 33% stake).

You can see a tweet thread between me and Zaki that pointed out how broken CMC has been for several months:


Tweet thread where CMC committed to making the fix happen: https://twitter.com/zmanian/status/1292642715725832192


You can see on CoinGecko that the circ supply increase was much more gradual. We finally got CMC to commit to timely updates (now in the form of the API endpoint that CoinGecko and¬†explorer.solana.com/supply¬†have used for many months) which we were happy about. But because their historical graph only updates when they update the number, this resulted in a supposed ""spike"" in circ supply. The reality is that the graph just represents the changes in what CMC was tracking, not actual change in circ supply.

I see this happen alot - people mix things that are true and verifiable, with things that are theoretical and not implemented, and it causes a lot of confusion.

Inflation is implemented and happening right now.  It's around 8% per year, and will reduce a little bit each year, until it hits a constant 1.5% in about 11 years.  Here is all the details on that:

https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/ed_overview/ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_protocol_based_rewards

Slashing - the mechanism for punishing validators who break the rules - is NOT implemented.  It's all theory right now.

The only concrete thing that slashing has been proposed to be used for is for punishing validators who break the voting rules -- the rules are that validators are not supposed to 'switch forks' for a certain amount of time after voting on a fork (if there are two forks and a validator chooses to vote on fork A and not B, then that validator is committed to only voting on fork A for a certain period of time; if the validator wants to switch to fork B because it believes that fork has become the better fork, it must wait to do so but not voting on fork A for a while until it has satisfied the waiting period, then it can switch to voting on fork B; this is to provide the mechanism that forces validators to commit to forks which then allows forks to win or lose; if every validator voted on every fork, then no fork would ever die and there would just be more and more forks).

But there is noting right now preventing a validator from breaking those rules and voting on multiple forks at once.  In fact, validators are kind of economically incentivized to do so because they will be guaranteed to get more votes in, which makes more money.  As far as I know, validators are currently being honest and following the fork voting rules; but if they are doing so, it's just out of honesty.  There is no penalty for being dishonest, because there is no slashing implemented.  (Also, i would take expertise and work to modify the validator code to allow this kind of multi-fork voting, and nobody with the time and expertise has been motivated to do that, as far as I know.)

Then there are nebulous claims that slashing could be implemented to deal with provably malicious validators - for example a validator which can be shown to have tried to consistently cheat with false transactions or something like that, or which has a pattern of creating unnecessary forks so flagrantly that it must be malicious, etc.  The mechanism for this slashing has never been fully explained, just hinted at.  But because deciding on guilt would involve some degree of human judgement, it's hard to see how this would happen without the Solana Foundation just coding the slash directly into the validator code and convincing all the validators to accept that new software that enforces the slash.  The foundation has great power here because most validators will just blindly go along with whatever the foundation says, and will install whatever new version of the validator software the foundation makes.

If this all seems a little unsatisfactory to you, then we're in agreement.  I think the foundation needs to implement a mechanism for automated slashing of validators who violate vote rules.  But I guess this will take some time.

In the meantime, talking about slashing like it exists now, is misleading.",True,,0,1617939209,,1617939557.0,0,gtw4bnz,False,t3_mn27en,False,t1_gtvsl39,/r/solana/comments/mn27en/new_to_solana/gtw4bnz/,,,9,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtw4bnz,1628361439.0,False

,aeyakovenko,founder,,Anatoly (Co-Founder),"Delegated POS typically refers to EOS style voting, where some fixed number of block producers are elected to run the network.  Solana/Cosmos/Tezos/eth2 are PoS networks with programable staking (not sure about eth2 yet).

The reason why any of this matters is that the smallest set of nodes that add up to the liveness threshold for consensus can censor any message in the network.  So the MIN set to get to 1/3 on solana can pick which traders/transfers land on the chain and in what order.  This is true for any network, and the only way to solve this is to maximize that set.

,JayPBanks,,,,"That‚Äôs not how it works my friend. Market caps are literally based on free market price x tokens. You will see different sources base it off circulating, total, max. 

All you need to worry about (long term) is fully diluted supply x current price. If you think the current state of development is worth less than a max supply cap then it‚Äôs a good buy. 

Here is a good way to understand:
Solana is a layer 1 network, therefore it should be compared against other layer 1s (ETH, XTZ, XLM etc). You also need to factor in network functionality/capability (smart contracts, tx time etc) 

When you compare these networks, you ideally would be looking at all of them fully diluted with current state of development. 

Solana is currently valued at 30% of similar layer 1s. SOL is actually much better technologically than most layer 1s. It is easily worth the same as as many in the top 20.

Tron ($1B) 
Cardano ($2B)
Tezos ($2B)
EOS ($2.5B)
XLM ($1.5B)

In my opinion, Solana is worthy of being in that range. All of those are not even fully diluted for each network. Here is another example:

Algorand is a very comparable network to Solana as far as development, team, functionality etc..

ALGO circulating mcap is $194M but fully diluted is $2.5B. Solana is barely 10% fully diluted to Algorand max mcap but is a very comparable project. So if you‚Äôre buying ALGO at these prices over Solana then you‚Äôre saying it is 10x better fully diluted. This is laughable if anybody truly believes that. 

If you‚Äôre investing long term then you should look at the token distribution relative to when you believe you‚Äôll close your position. All of the networks I named should be valued in the range of $1B-$5B fully diluted mcap. 

Hopefully this helps. I started a financial support group last month to help people understand the complexities here. This is a simplified synopsis and should be taken lightly. Only for perspective. Good luck.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"And since you asked, I'm going to give you even more info than you ever wanted to know.

Currently, there are what I consider to be 4 major groups of validators:

(1). The big guns.  This is almost everyone in the top 12 - 15.  These validators have many millions staked to them and usually are quite professional organizations who have made a business of staking.  They are great choices from a reliability standpoint, but many do not offer particularly great commission.  A few offer very low or zero commission, but this will not last (although you might as well take advantage of it while you can right?!).  HOWEVER, these are already the most-staked validators which means that staking to them is kinda bad for the network.  So if you really want to do what is best for Solana you will only stake *some* of your tokens there, and spread the rest lower.

(2). The middle-of-the-pack: these are larger although not nearly as large as the big ones, and they range from like around 300,000 stake through 3 or 4 million stake.  I think that most are still quite well run - they seem to be just as reliable as the largest ones, and I've been waching very closely for a couple of weeks.  There are maybe 20 - 30 validators to pick in this range.   I think that all of them would be a fine choice.  Be aware though that many in the 1.5 - 3.5 million stake range are actually in what I am calling category 3, but these are obvious as category 3 has 100% commission so you would never want to stake with them anyway (as you'd make 0%, and they'd make 100%, off of your stake).

(3). There is some very large whale who appears to be self-staking about 50 million SOL.  It may be a group of whales who got together or something.  Anyway, this is a large group of about 20 validators with 1.5 - 3.5 million SOL staked *each* and a 100% commission.  They don't want your stake.  Don't stake with them.

(4). The Hetzner crowd.  This is a huge number of validators that are almost all located in Hetzner low-cost data centers in Europe.  They are all staked with around 200,000 - 230,000 SOL.  They were staked by the Solana Foundation as part of the program to encourage new validators to start up.  Someone figured out that the cheapest way to do this was to sign up for a 100 Euro monthly plan from Hetzner and start pumping out validators.  I am not saying it's all one person or a small group of people, but I have no doubt that it's a community that together figured out how to run a bunch of validators in Europe for the lowest possible cost.  Literally half of the mainnet validators in existence are these.  I find that they tend to be the least reliable and provide the worst return.  I staked with some of them before I knew much about Solana and they had the worst performance (but still it was only like 1% APY different from my best performance - so not a huge difference -- but you *did* say ""max rewards"", so ...).  As long as the price of SOL stays high, these validators will keep going, but I would imagine that they are the most price-sensitive, because if the price of SOL goes down, they will be the first to become unprofitable and some may stop validating.  I don't know for sure.  All of them I am sure would love to have your stake because they are all competing in a very large pool of over 250 validators with almost no way to differentiate between them.  Also they almost all have high commissions - 10% - which means that because of being overall the least reliable, highest commission, and most concentrated in one data center (Hetzner), they are probably the worst choice for someone looking for ""max value"".

Of course there is a 5th category - small validators with 30,000 or less - some validators having less than 5,000 staked.  I have no idea what these validators are doing since you're almost certainly losing money running a validator at this level of stake.  I wish them luck though ...",True,,0,1616892213,,1616892425.0,0,gsj3jt8,False,t3_meiwg6,False,t1_gshz1dp,/r/solana/comments/meiwg6/choosing_a_validator_for_max_rewards/gsj3jt8/,,,11,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 150, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

While applications would need to be reprogrammed, from a user perspective... if I  can earn 200% staking on SOL and 200% staking on ETH - what value does the application on ETH provide? And to address the real issue, if I earn 200% and then burn my gains to cover ETH gas fees, what real value is created?

What will Solana talk about in this Webinar?
It will be a recap on DeFi. 
But, what is DeFi?
Decentralized Finance (or more simply DeFi) refers to an ecosystem of financial applications developed on the basis of network blockchain. 

More precisely, the term Decentralized Finance can refer to a movement that aims to create an ecosystem of financial services open source, permissionless and transparent, which is available to all and operates without any central authority. Users would retain full control of their assets, interacting with this ecosystem through decentralized (dapp) peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.

It seems that Solana has over 1000 tps with it still not yet being mainstream. Ethereum on the other hand caps out at 15 tps. This big difference suggests that the concept of a ‚Äútransaction‚Äù is different in both networks.

To do the entire work of an Eth transaction in Solana, would this require multiple Solana transactions? What is the factor here? If 1 Eth tx is equivalent to 100 Sol tx, the improvement with Solana is still remarkable but not an improvement factor of 10k. Likewise, where are the 1000 tps coming from when there is not yet that much trading going on?

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"In my opinion 'wallet' is a concept that just creates confusion.  You don't need any wallet.  Any SOL 'system account' that can hold SOL or control staking delegation is just a public/private key pair, which is just a pair of long numbers.  That's ALL that you need.  You can generate a keypair and then store that data somewhere and always have a way to control your account from that data.  You don't need any software as you can just download the Solana command line client any time you need it, use it with keypair, and the uninstall it until you need it again.

There is a way to 'store' your public and private key as a sequence of 12 English words and a passcode you generate.  All you're really storing at that point is the data necessary to re-generate the public and private key pair (that data being encoded in 12 English words); but the nice thing is that you can write and store those 12 words anywhere (including on something like a laminated paper card that you keep under your mattress) and as long as you remember the passcode as well (probably a good idea to write this down too, or even better write down a 'reminder' that will help you remember it if you forget it, but won't help someone who doesn't know the passcode already guess it) and store that somewhere separate.

If you do that, then starting with just those 12 words and your remembered passcode, you can take any computer (that you trust!), download the Solana command line client, and do every transaction you need to, with no other software needing to be installed persistently.

In terms of the number of SOL 'system accounts' you need, I think you really only need 1.  I have one SOL system account (i.e. public/private key pair that I store encoded as 12 English words along with a passcode) and that is controlling 6 staking accounts to which I delegated my SOL and then staked to validators, all using the command line client.

That one SOL system account controls them all and that means that 'all my eggs are in one basket', so if you are truly paranoid, you could split your system account into multiple and then keep all of those 12 word groups and passcodes separately stored in separate safe locations and then use them like a bunch of smaller separate accounts instead of one big account.  However, at that point you have also increased your risk of making errors since you have that many more moving pieces to manage so you will have to decide for yourself what you are comfortable with.

If my SOL ever became worth ""real money"" I would definitely split it across more than on Solana system account, but for the time being, I am just fine with just one.

I periodically check my balances using the command line tool which forces me to repeat the process of acquiring those 12 words and remembering my passcode, so that I don't forget how the software works or  what my passcode is.

EDIT: I should point out that starting from those 12 words and passcode and using the Solana command line interface, I believe (although have never done this) that you can send SOL to any ""hosted wallet"" you want to, I think those services just provide a SOL address to send your SOL to (which you would do with the command line client) and then those services manage the SOL transactions from that SOL system account -- which they own and control by the way, so at that point you are 100% trusting a third party to hold your SOL for you -- and can trade them on their platform.

For example, I did try to create a Binance.us account although it seems like they will never validate me for trades since what happens on that site seems to be up to the whims of fate and phases of the moon - but they are happy to tell me about a SOL address that I can send my SOL to so that they can own it on my behalf and theoretically trade it for other stuff.",True,,0,1614045537,,1614105154.0,0,goeurdi,False,t3_lq2nug,True,t1_goed3op,/r/solana/comments/lq2nug/omg/goeurdi/,,,1,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 125, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'When you come across a feel-good thing.', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': None, 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_5f123e3d-4f48-42f4-9c11-e98b566d5897', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Wholesome', 'penny_donate': None, 'penny_price': None, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92932f465d58e4c16b12b6eac4ca07d27e3d11c0', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d11484a208d68a318bf9d4fcf371171a1cb6a7ef', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febdf28b6f39f7da7eb1365325b85e0bb49a9f63', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4406a2d88bf86fa3dc8a45aacf7e0c7bdccc4fb', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19555b13e3e196b62eeb9160d1ac1d1b372dcb0b', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92932f465d58e4c16b12b6eac4ca07d27e3d11c0', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d11484a208d68a318bf9d4fcf371171a1cb6a7ef', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=febdf28b6f39f7da7eb1365325b85e0bb49a9f63', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4406a2d88bf86fa3dc8a45aacf7e0c7bdccc4fb', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19555b13e3e196b62eeb9160d1ac1d1b372dcb0b', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_goeurdi,1627036554.0,

Currently, there are what I consider to be 4 major groups of validators:

(1). The big guns.  This is almost everyone in the top 12 - 15.  These validators have many millions staked to them and usually are quite professional organizations who have made a business of staking.  They are great choices from a reliability standpoint, but many do not offer particularly great commission.  A few offer very low or zero commission, but this will not last (although you might as well take advantage of it while you can right?!).  HOWEVER, these are already the most-staked validators which means that staking to them is kinda bad for the network.  So if you really want to do what is best for Solana you will only stake *some* of your tokens there, and spread the rest lower.

(2). The middle-of-the-pack: these are larger although not nearly as large as the big ones, and they range from like around 300,000 stake through 3 or 4 million stake.  I think that most are still quite well run - they seem to be just as reliable as the largest ones, and I've been waching very closely for a couple of weeks.  There are maybe 20 - 30 validators to pick in this range.   I think that all of them would be a fine choice.  Be aware though that many in the 1.5 - 3.5 million stake range are actually in what I am calling category 3, but these are obvious as category 3 has 100% commission so you would never want to stake with them anyway (as you'd make 0%, and they'd make 100%, off of your stake).

(3). There is some very large whale who appears to be self-staking about 50 million SOL.  It may be a group of whales who got together or something.  Anyway, this is a large group of about 20 validators with 1.5 - 3.5 million SOL staked *each* and a 100% commission.  They don't want your stake.  Don't stake with them.

(4). The Hetzner crowd.  This is a huge number of validators that are almost all located in Hetzner low-cost data centers in Europe.  They are all staked with around 200,000 - 230,000 SOL.  They were staked by the Solana Foundation as part of the program to encourage new validators to start up.  Someone figured out that the cheapest way to do this was to sign up for a 100 Euro monthly plan from Hetzner and start pumping out validators.  I am not saying it's all one person or a small group of people, but I have no doubt that it's a community that together figured out how to run a bunch of validators in Europe for the lowest possible cost.  Literally half of the mainnet validators in existence are these.  I find that they tend to be the least reliable and provide the worst return.  I staked with some of them before I knew much about Solana and they had the worst performance (but still it was only like 1% APY different from my best performance - so not a huge difference -- but you *did* say ""max rewards"", so ...).  As long as the price of SOL stays high, these validators will keep going, but I would imagine that they are the most price-sensitive, because if the price of SOL goes down, they will be the first to become unprofitable and some may stop validating.  I don't know for sure.  All of them I am sure would love to have your stake because they are all competing in a very large pool of over 250 validators with almost no way to differentiate between them.  Also they almost all have high commissions - 10% - which means that because of being overall the least reliable, highest commission, and most concentrated in one data center (Hetzner), they are probably the worst choice for someone looking for ""max value"".

Of course there is a 5th category - small validators with 30,000 or less - some validators having less than 5,000 staked.  I have no idea what these validators are doing since you're almost certainly losing money running a validator at this level of stake.  I wish them luck though ...",True,,0,1616892213,,1616892425.0,0,gsj3jt8,False,t3_meiwg6,False,t1_gshz1dp,/r/solana/comments/meiwg6/choosing_a_validator_for_max_rewards/gsj3jt8/,,,11,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 150, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

Truth be told, it does look like a bitconnect level meme silently gestating.

Just some things to consider:

* People in the project; There are names / faces / reputations that are tied to this project, they are real people, with real credentials, I'm not sure if this means much to you, but to me it means culpability if things do go wrong.
* The project itself; have you actually tried to transact using sol? have a go, download a wallet on your phone / pc and send some between two devices, it's near instant, which is impressive for a token that also handles smart contacts.
* The investments; Obviously a double edged sword, but, initial investors are what helped this token exist in the first place, this also helps with marketing (which some tokens / coins sorely miss)
* Connections; Binance is on board, there is also a connection with Coinbase (see: Staking via Coinbase custody), whether this manifests into something like a listing or not, remains to be seen.
* It's Chad Ethereum
* Consistent announcements

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"There are efforts currently underway to create what are called ""stake pools"".  These are going to be a network-supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its SOL to validators.  The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right.  It's sort of a second layer of staking, where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security.

I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months.

Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster - 'stake boss' is a thing soon to be released (from what I have read) by Block Logic, the company that does validators.app.  Stake Boss is not a true stake pool - there is no token created to represent membership, it's a much more direct mechanism where you simply re-assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security.  In this case you're basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you, that manager being Stake Boss.  It's similar to what stake pools will be in practice.

Keep in mind that it's not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top; if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing, you may be fine with that.  You're basically paying to have your stake managed, which is a perfectly valid service that you may find worth the cost.

Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools (and possibly Stake Boss, although I don't know Block Logic's exact plans, only they know) will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around.  Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know, some may spread only a little bit, it will be up to how the pool is managed.

So when those come online, there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage.

If you are not in the USA, then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators -- it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the ""Tour de SOL"" whereby they prove the quality of their systems, and once they pass all the hurdles, then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225,000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself.  More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program.  However, this is only available to non-US participants, and it also only happens occasionally, and furthermore, I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators.

I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through ""connections"".  The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL.  Those institutional investors don't even seem to care that much about the quality of validation - the highest stake validator, Chorus One, was down for more than 9 hours last epoch, which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators - and yet Chorus One didn't lose any stake because of it, instead they seem to just be gaining more ...

So to some degree, stake begets more stake, which makes it even harder for those trying to enter.  You are going to have to rely on connections, if you have them, and handouts from the foundation and stake pools, if and when those become available.

Once you have some stake and are in the system, you can then try to attract more, with lower commission, better service, better returns, additional services offered, and ... marketing.  Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists.  This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention.  We'll see ....

p.s. if you are considering running a validator, you may want to consult my spreadsheet of expected Validator returns.  You will have to make a copy of the sheet to be able to edit the values, but it will allow you to play with the numbers, put in what you might expect to achieve ... it calculates expected profit and also calculates what the amount of SOL you'd have to have staked to your validator is in order to break even.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree.  The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0% commission, like Everstake.

I also agree that no-commission validation is not sustainable.  These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base.  I don't quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though, given that they've attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere. 

I run a validator and I have 8% commission which I think is pretty close to the average.

Within a given commission range, you can also look at the total number of votes being cast, since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting.  Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible, then the overall take will be as large as possible (but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers).

On validators.app, you can see this in the ""Skipped Vote % (distance from leader)"" metric.  The closer to 0, the better (so -0.40% is better than -1.0%), because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer.

So basically there are two factors: how close to optimally the validator is voting (represented by very small skipped vote %) and what commission the validator is taking.  Of the two, unless the skipped vote % is very high, the commission will make the larger difference.

My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0.25% of the very best (represented by values like -0.24% on validators.app).  But I charge 8% commission.

Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network - it makes it more centralized and reduces its security.  So if you want to do what's best for Solana itself, you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators.  Maybe something like 3/4 of your stake on big low-fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators?

That's what I did when I started.  I picked 6 - two in the top 10, two in the 10 - 30 range, and two in the 30 - 100 range (in total stake ranking).  I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission.

,DigitalInstincts,founder,,Raj (Co-Founder),"Hey! I'm the Solana Labs COO, Raj Gokal. Thanks for the question! I'll get right to the answer:

Solana is completely open. Any validators can join the network. It's a PoS system called ""[Tower BFT](https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79)"" based on pBFT, but delegation is an option for any token holders. You can see a list of all the current validators, their performance, and stake weights at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io), and even go become a validator by dropping into the [validator docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator).

There is no maximum number of nodes that the network can manage or will allow. There will never be a limit to the number of nodes that can join. The network is completely open and permissionless, and always will be.

Our block propagation protocol ""[Turbine](https://medium.com/solana-labs/turbine-solanas-block-propagation-protocol-solves-the-scalability-trilemma-2ddba46a51db)"" allows for a ""logarithmic"" increase of finality times with the number of nodes. This means the network *does* slow down a bit with every new node, but *decreasingly* so with every successive node. We expect to see confirmation times in the sub-second range through tens of thousands of nodes.

You can learn more about the 8 innovations that make this all possible, including Turbine and Tower BFT, [here](https://medium.com/solana-labs/7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda)!",True,False,0,1591931859,,False,0,ftrn90q,False,t3_h0xv1d,True,t3_h0xv1d,/r/solana/comments/h0xv1d/solana_open_consensus/ftrn90q/,,1597793936.0,2,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,dark,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Raj (Co-Founder)'}]",richtext,1459515207.0,t2_wsxfq,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,,0.0,,,,True,[],,,,,,

I have never used Raydium or Serum, but those two are the services that you are relying on to properly execute your transaction and it sounds like one or both of them failed you.  You should contact their support I think.

I personally have only ever used the Solana command line client and it has never failed me.  Sometimes it doesn't complete transactions but it never leaves things in a bad state -- the transaction if failed just didn't happen and I submit the command again until it succeeds.

Sometimes I get a failure from the command line client but then if I check a little later, I find that the transaction has actually been posted to the block chain so it went through and the error from the client was spurious.

Maybe, and this is just a guess, those services you use are 'conservative' in that if any part of the transaction fails, they halt any attempt at completing the transaction until some time period has passed.  In that case, I would expect that all is needed is some patience as you want for the transaction to finally succeed.  If this is what is happening (and I don't know if it is or not, it's just a theory), then I would recommend that you contact those sites and let them know that you'd appreciate more visibility into your transactions, such as being notified if a transaction is pending or failed and retrying or whatever, instead of being told nothing.

2. Verifiers respond as fast as they can.  this is where the leader can basically pick and choose their favorite verifiers and do some censorship up until 2/3+1 majority requirement.  but, so can every leader, and everyones ""choice"" of censorship is encoded into the chain.  Basically, if you censor someone, expect them to censor you back equally.
3.  right now we have a bare bones gossip protocol that sends random requests, but checkout this issue to optimize convergence, https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/302
4. It's because we can do optimistic concurrency control.  Basically, all the verifiers can optimistically vote assuming that everyone else will vote as well without observing anyone else vote.  When they actually observe the votes later they can trust the PoH data structure without witnessing the votes directly.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"There are efforts currently underway to create what are called ""stake pools"".  These are going to be a network-supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its SOL to validators.  The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right.  It's sort of a second layer of staking, where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security.

I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months.

Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster - 'stake boss' is a thing soon to be released (from what I have read) by Block Logic, the company that does validators.app.  Stake Boss is not a true stake pool - there is no token created to represent membership, it's a much more direct mechanism where you simply re-assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security.  In this case you're basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you, that manager being Stake Boss.  It's similar to what stake pools will be in practice.

Keep in mind that it's not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top; if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing, you may be fine with that.  You're basically paying to have your stake managed, which is a perfectly valid service that you may find worth the cost.

Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools (and possibly Stake Boss, although I don't know Block Logic's exact plans, only they know) will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around.  Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know, some may spread only a little bit, it will be up to how the pool is managed.

So when those come online, there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage.

If you are not in the USA, then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators -- it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the ""Tour de SOL"" whereby they prove the quality of their systems, and once they pass all the hurdles, then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225,000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself.  More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program.  However, this is only available to non-US participants, and it also only happens occasionally, and furthermore, I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators.

I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through ""connections"".  The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL.  Those institutional investors don't even seem to care that much about the quality of validation - the highest stake validator, Chorus One, was down for more than 9 hours last epoch, which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators - and yet Chorus One didn't lose any stake because of it, instead they seem to just be gaining more ...

So to some degree, stake begets more stake, which makes it even harder for those trying to enter.  You are going to have to rely on connections, if you have them, and handouts from the foundation and stake pools, if and when those become available.

Once you have some stake and are in the system, you can then try to attract more, with lower commission, better service, better returns, additional services offered, and ... marketing.  Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists.  This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention.  We'll see ....

p.s. if you are considering running a validator, you may want to consult my spreadsheet of expected Validator returns.  You will have to make a copy of the sheet to be able to edit the values, but it will allow you to play with the numbers, put in what you might expect to achieve ... it calculates expected profit and also calculates what the amount of SOL you'd have to have staked to your validator is in order to break even.

Perhaps part of the confusion here is that some people seem to be asking questions about the fundamental design and expected ultimate outcome, and others are focusing on the current partial realization of that design.

Ultimately there is no central authority because someone else could come along with better software and take mindshare of validators and create a duopoly of control.  Repeat the process and eventually there is a plurality of vendors providing software and therefore influencing the overall workings of the network.

I don't think there has ever been nor will ever be any kind of system like this that wasn't highly ""centralized"" (if that's the term we're choosing to describe this) at the outset and centralized to some degree even after that.  Bitcoin for example was highly dependent on the original source code base and I'm pretty sure that the cabal of developers who were working on it early on were the centralized authority of bitcoin.  I didn't follow the history very closely (stopped watching in 2011 when it was clear that bitcoin would never scale) but there was a split with bitcoin cash wasn't there?  Imagine if all the developers had agreed with the changes that BCH wanted to make.  Then I am 100% confident that there would have been no split, just a change in the bitcoin protocol enforced via mindshare of the majority of bitcoin developers, and following from them everyone who took the bitcoin software.  That's exactly what you're calling a ""central authority"".  They are unavoidable.

However, even the ""central authority"" doesn't have complete control.  Anyone can come along and erode that authority if they can make better software that validators want to take.

And I would expect Solana to evolve in that direction, where the foundation is actively working to reduce their own authority by adding more automated mechanisms to the Solana protocol that don't rely or even accept any central oversight.  Slashing is an interesting example.  I don't know how they are thinking to decentralize it.  Allow validators to propose a slash and then have all the other validators vote on it?  Seems most logical.  Maybe the slash proposal would have a URL in it where the validator proposing the slash could lay out their case?

1. Its not their fault or problem that ETH was not scalable and able to handle the amount of transactions that come through the block chain or able to handle the data needed on transactions. Innovation takes trial and error. They tried ETH cause at the time it was the best option, then quickly realized that it was going to work. Didn't screw any ETH supporters, invest in ETH not KIN if thats your priority.
2. The money raised has went to incredible developments. Its not Kin's fault that they got hit with the lawsuit and had to dig themselves out of the whole. I applaud them for not laying down and fighting back at the SEC.
3. They went to stellar cause stellar could handle more transactions than ETH but guess what, they maxed out that block chain too. Their are people and apps sitting on the sidelines right now ready to join in the ecosystem as soon as it can scale so the move to Solana is the only way to make that happen. You say they joined stellar probably just cause they received funding. That's false and if that was true than when Solana pulled their funding they offered to kin, then why is kin still coming over to Solana?

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98.

False,[deleted],,,,"Solana is not ignoring decentralization. Are there more decentralised networks out there? Maybe. There's always tradeoffs in building software.

Regarding the requirements, if you look up the prices of those components, you get to ~ $8000 (1 processor, 4ssds, 128gb ram) but let's say it was $10,000. That is ~$54,000 cheaper than running an eth2 node(requires 32eth, ~$64K). Sure there are staking pools on eth2 but solana can and likely will have them too.

The question is whether people want to become a validator on a network like Solana which has (~6 times) cheaper validator entry requirements (and more scalability without sharding) than eth2 but not as much name recognition and higher operational costs. Time will tell us the answer.

Q1. To be announce. Mobile wallets is just. An option for having a sol on a mobile wallet ü§£
FYI. Sol has many marketplace you can see sol on biggest exchange. So mobile wallet? What for? 

Q2. Road map? We have binance research you can see few of the roadmap there and more to come. Basically Solana is a high-performance, permissionless blockchain that features support for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Have any idea what does means?

Q3. Good you know solana well, you just broke some of your bone on solana from selling your bag on low price. Good job, mobile wallet improvement? Yah sure, its like etherium to eth 2.0..evolving blockchain but same gas fee and poor transaction speed. but solana is better than etherium. Its just like eth come first in the space. So no questions for that. Just the bunch of freaking gas!!
Solana will be the second and the future.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"There are efforts currently underway to create what are called ""stake pools"".  These are going to be a network-supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its SOL to validators.  The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right.  It's sort of a second layer of staking, where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security.

I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months.

Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster - 'stake boss' is a thing soon to be released (from what I have read) by Block Logic, the company that does validators.app.  Stake Boss is not a true stake pool - there is no token created to represent membership, it's a much more direct mechanism where you simply re-assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security.  In this case you're basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you, that manager being Stake Boss.  It's similar to what stake pools will be in practice.

Keep in mind that it's not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top; if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing, you may be fine with that.  You're basically paying to have your stake managed, which is a perfectly valid service that you may find worth the cost.

Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools (and possibly Stake Boss, although I don't know Block Logic's exact plans, only they know) will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around.  Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know, some may spread only a little bit, it will be up to how the pool is managed.

So when those come online, there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage.

If you are not in the USA, then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators -- it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the ""Tour de SOL"" whereby they prove the quality of their systems, and once they pass all the hurdles, then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225,000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself.  More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program.  However, this is only available to non-US participants, and it also only happens occasionally, and furthermore, I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators.

I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through ""connections"".  The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL.  Those institutional investors don't even seem to care that much about the quality of validation - the highest stake validator, Chorus One, was down for more than 9 hours last epoch, which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators - and yet Chorus One didn't lose any stake because of it, instead they seem to just be gaining more ...

So to some degree, stake begets more stake, which makes it even harder for those trying to enter.  You are going to have to rely on connections, if you have them, and handouts from the foundation and stake pools, if and when those become available.

Once you have some stake and are in the system, you can then try to attract more, with lower commission, better service, better returns, additional services offered, and ... marketing.  Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists.  This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention.  We'll see ....

p.s. if you are considering running a validator, you may want to consult my spreadsheet of expected Validator returns.  You will have to make a copy of the sheet to be able to edit the values, but it will allow you to play with the numbers, put in what you might expect to achieve ... it calculates expected profit and also calculates what the amount of SOL you'd have to have staked to your validator is in order to break even.

Cool. I want to ask you about blockchain's space cost: With Bitcoin, in order to occupy space on the blockchain (store transactions), you have to pay a high fee because you only have 1MB every 10 minutes (or a little more if everyone used Segwit) of space available.

I am talking about the possibility of an eventual attacker to, relatively cheaply, occupy disk space on nodes.

Ethereum was the first blockhain to offer turing complete smart-contracts. It was a feat in itself. Absolute performance was not the focus in the beginning (even though it is faster than BTC). Today it has to compose with a lot of legacy code and apps which makes implementing changes complicated.
2. Politics.  
Scaling is also a matter of strategy and therefore politics. Ethereum has been plagued by them for some time (Endless Eth 2.0 and scaling debates). It seems Rollups are a way to make governance easier and put the burden of platform evolutions back on devs (c.f Vitalik's words on Rollup Centric Future of Ethereum).
3. Tech

2. The state of mind of the development team is an essential factor. I think it takes time for something to grow. Along the way, you will get setbacks. Therefore you need to stay strong in your vision. And communicate with your community to keep a solid foundation. For example, Solana is a big competitor of Ethereum. They won‚Äôt allow Solana to come into their space without a ‚Äúfight‚Äù.

3. Solana was launched in March 2020. So to me, it's relatively new. And for a while, DiFi was focussing on Ethereum.

I think the user base is fluid. To me, moving chains is not like leaving Facebook to \[insert social media site here\], where if you move to another network - you potentially lose the value of the network = your connections / friends.

While applications would need to be reprogrammed, from a user perspective... if I  can earn 200% staking on SOL and 200% staking on ETH - what value does the application on ETH provide? And to address the real issue, if I earn 200% and then burn my gains to cover ETH gas fees, what real value is created?  This is what I think that cyrpto defi heads like me are figuring out, especially with the launch of Raydium. I am no whale, so the fees matter...

There is reported to be good amount of development for SOL right now. All the tools are almost in place. Wallets, stable coins, DEX, AMM, Etc. But, I do think one of the biggest pieces missing is a marketplace like AAVE.  I do hope a discussion about an AAVE / SOL application could be taking place as AAVE supported the recent SOL hackathon.... That last comment is pure FUD BTW.

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98.

Two Possible Scenarios

The second scenario - If the price will follow the Elliot wave count.

If you dig through ACTUAL DATA you will see that the APY is at best around 8.25% right now.  That's if you use a 0% commission validator (there aren't many) that gets the best returns.  TBH my validator (Blade Validator) is about the best return validator out there right now and I'm not too shy to say it.  But the difference between the best and middle of the pack is only about 0.5% APY so we're not talking huge differences here.  Your best bet is to spread stake around to give yourself the greatest security and also to help the network by supporting the most validators.

If you are so inclined, you can research the actual APY using the solana command line client.  You can go to solanabeach.io, find a validator, click on it, and then find its largest stake account.  Then you use the solana command line client to query about that stake account and see its recent returns.  That will tell you the APY being achieved by that validator (the APY is the same for all stake accounts staked to a validator; I always pick the largest just because the numbers are biggest and thus least subject to rounding errors).

For example, using my validator:

At solanabeach.io, I click the menu icon in the upper right and switch to Validators view.

Then in the list I see Blade Validator at spot 45.  I click on that to go to a details page for that validator.  Scrolling down to the Delegators list I see the largest Stake Account at the top of the list and click on it.

Now I am on a Stake Account Details page, and I go to the Address and use the copy icon to copy the address.

Then I go to my terminal and use the solana command line client like so to get details of that stake account:

I can see here every epoch for the past 6 epochs and the APY for each epoch.

It's currently at 8.23%.  It went up from 7.74% because I just set my commission to 0% last epoch, it was 8% previously.  So you can see that the difference in returns from an 8% commission validator and a 0% commission validator is about 0.5% APY.  Not a huge difference, but not insignificant either.

You can do the above with any validator, choosing its largest stake account and then using solana stake-account command to find out what kind of APY that validator has been achieving.  Here are some examples for the most recent epoch:

    Chorus One: 7.40% APY
    Everstake: 8.09% APY
    melea.xyz: 8.17% APY
    Forbole: 7.47% APY
    moonlet.io: 7.79% APY

Everstake and melea.xyz are 0% commission validators which is why they are the best APY in this list.  But they're still not as good as my validator.  Why?  Because my validator has 0% commission AND the best vote performance, and vote performance determines overall payout.",True,,0,1617556021,,1617556499.0,0,gtd3voe,False,t3_mjhyrh,False,t1_gtbjmnn,/r/solana/comments/mjhyrh/how_do_i_stake/gtd3voe/,,,5,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 80, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Everything is better with a good hug', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_8352bdff-3e03-4189-8a08-82501dd8f835', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Hugz', 'penny_donate': 0, 'penny_price': 0, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a23bf7f08b633508dedf457f2704c522b94a04', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f2f16e71d2929e3d7275060af3ad6b851dbfb1', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca487311563425e195699a4d7e4c57a98cbfde8b', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b4eedcffb1c09a826e7837532c52979760f1d2b', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d5ab237eb71a9f02bb3bf9ad5ee43741918d6c', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69997ace3ef4ffc099b81d774c2c8f1530602875', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9519d1999ef9dce5c8a9f59369cb92f52d95319', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f076c6434fb2d2f9075991810fd845c40fa73fc6', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85527145e0c4b754306a30df29e584fd16187636', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8843cdf82c3b741d7af057c14076dcd2621e811', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtd3voe,1628409656.0,False

I say that because I actually don't know anything, not because I am challenging what you say.  In what way are US citizens hamstrung with regards to the Solana foundation?  I sincerely do not know and would appreciate any info you have ...

US entities are unable to get SOL rewards for participating in their test net initiatives, like TdS for example (so the recommendation to get started there is useless for me unfortunately). You're able to start up a node on the mainnet, but unless you'd been doing it for a while or had acquired a large amount of SOL, I don't see a realistic way in if you're an individual in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.

I thought about this as well and am mulling it over. Not a bad idea at all. If I recall I think you can get on their testnet to get familiar with it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think part of the reason that people are likely hesitant to share, however, is that existing validators do not want competition.

2. Generate your own keypair using: solana-keygen new -o inflation.json  
. Keep it safe, if you are successfully elected during the *Voting Period* this keypair can be used to enable full-inflation via: solana feature activate inflation.json  
.
3. Submit your nomination! Fork the [solana project 2](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana), apply the contents of [this 2](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/14724) template to your fork and submit a pull request. You‚Äôll be adding the two keys generated above to the template: *Vote Address* from step 1 and *Enable Address* from step 2 along with an identifier labelled with the placeholder ""my\_name‚Äù. The core team will help you merge your PR but you might be required to make minor formatting or other changes to ensure that it compiles successfully.

Once these steps are completed, you will have submitted a nomination for *Inflation Candidate*!

### Then what happens?

At the close of the *Nomination Period* (next Friday), a new Solana build will be shipped that includes all of the nominations described above (i.e. the release will include all of the nominee pull requests). If that release is adopted by the majority of the validators on the network, the [Feature Proposals 1](https://spl.solana.com/feature-proposal) for all of the *Inflation Candidates* will be then initiated by the Solana Foundation and the *Voting Period* will begin.

As mentioned above, a new release will be generated that includes all of the nominations submitted over the *Nomination Period*. The *Voting Period* will begin if/when 95% of the validators upgrade to that release version on Mainnet Beta. From past upgrades, we expect this to take a few days so it is likely that the *Voting Period* may begin Tuesday or Wednesday (Feb 9th or 10th) the following week.

During the *Voting Period* the Solana Foundation will post the instructions on how to vote along with the *Inflation Candidate* identifiers and *Vote Addresses* that were collected during the *Nomination Period*.

Once any *Inflation Candidate* receives &gt;66% of the Vote SPL Tokens submitted to their Feature Proposal acceptance address, they will automatically be able to enable the full-inflation feature for Mainnet Beta, using the inflation.json  
 keypair they generated which contains the *Enable Address*.

The fact that Solana only proves relative time is no problem for the application I envision. 

Let us say we have the following configuration:

1) Both the device that will be challenged, and the challenging hardware are controlled by the attacker

2) the attacker also controls the local Solana node that is physically close to the device to be challenged. The fact it is part of the Solana network and cannot let bad behavior be detected limits its options, but it still has options.

3) the challenge hardware takes PoH Hash N as input into its challenge query data, and stores the response from the device as a user-generated hash in PoH hash N+1.

I was wondering whether an upper bound on time could be observed and validated by the Solana ledger. In my example above, I am looking for a way for the remote validators to put a cap on Delta T\_max, in [this schematic](https://imgur.com/a/NtRr62e). 

The dashed vertical lines are ""synchronization"" lines (I did not read the white paper in detail yet, so I am just postulating there is such a mechanism), the small red lines are individual PoH hashes, nodes 1 and 2 are ""honest"" nodes, and node 3 runs faster first, to get ahead a little, then gives extra time to the device to compute a counterfeit response to the challenge, and resumes fast hashing to meet the next synchronization deadline.

I am looking for a way where the challenge response validators would only accept the response to the challenge if some conditions, allowing to cap Delta T Max, are met. 

In other words, how could the local Solana node reliably prove to the network that the challenge response was made with a Delta T\_max of less than, say, 1 ¬µs?

The point is to give strong assurance to the network that the external device did not have enough time to forge a counterfeit response before the challenge data became obsolete, and therefore, that it had to use the honest way to answer, as it would be the only way to submit an answer in time.

I think the user base is fluid. To me, moving chains is not like leaving Facebook to \[insert social media site here\], where if you move to another network - you potentially lose the value of the network = your connections / friends.

While applications would need to be reprogrammed, from a user perspective... if I  can earn 200% staking on SOL and 200% staking on ETH - what value does the application on ETH provide? And to address the real issue, if I earn 200% and then burn my gains to cover ETH gas fees, what real value is created?  This is what I think that cyrpto defi heads like me are figuring out, especially with the launch of Raydium. I am no whale, so the fees matter...

There is reported to be good amount of development for SOL right now. All the tools are almost in place. Wallets, stable coins, DEX, AMM, Etc. But, I do think one of the biggest pieces missing is a marketplace like AAVE.

And the supply is only going to keep increasing due to inflation.

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).  I don't mind at the outset where they are using that SOL as leverage to build the ecosystem (via rewards and staking grants, and eventually staking pool grants).  But I think that eventually they need to have a plan to burn that once Solana is wholly self-sustaining because one entity controlling 1/4 of the supply forever just seems bad.

2. Verifiers respond as fast as they can.  this is where the leader can basically pick and choose their favorite verifiers and do some censorship up until 2/3+1 majority requirement.  but, so can every leader, and everyones ""choice"" of censorship is encoded into the chain.  Basically, if you censor someone, expect them to censor you back equally.
3.  right now we have a bare bones gossip protocol that sends random requests, but checkout this issue to optimize convergence, https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/302

And the supply is only going to keep increasing due to inflation.

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).  I don't mind at the outset where they are using that SOL as leverage to build the ecosystem (via rewards and staking grants, and eventually staking pool grants).  But I think that eventually they need to have a plan to burn that once Solana is wholly self-sustaining because one entity controlling 1/4 of the supply forever just seems bad.

Just some things to consider:

* People in the project; There are names / faces / reputations that are tied to this project, they are real people, with real credentials, I'm not sure if this means much to you, but to me it means culpability if things do go wrong.
* The project itself; have you actually tried to transact using sol? have a go, download a wallet on your phone / pc and send some between two devices, it's near instant, which is impressive for a token that also handles smart contacts.
* The investments; Obviously a double edged sword, but, initial investors are what helped this token exist in the first place, this also helps with marketing (which some tokens / coins sorely miss)
* Connections; Binance is on board, there is also a connection with Coinbase (see: Staking via Coinbase custody), whether this manifests into something like a listing or not, remains to be seen.
* It's Chad Ethereum
* Consistent announcements

Two Possible Scenarios

The first scenario - If the price will continue its unstoppable surge then, it may reach up to $4.5 -$5 in no time after the potential test of the recent resistance that turns into support around 32,500- 33,000sats on a daily chart. From there, we need to see the price to rebound.

The second scenario - If the price will follow the Elliot wave count.

As an example, USDC just launched on SOL, and SOL is now the 2nd largest token network with 3.2% of the market. That was money moving from one chain to another, not new money. I think the user base is fluid. To me, moving chains is not like leaving Facebook to \[insert social media site here\], where if you move to another network - you potentially lose the value of the network = your connections / friends.

While applications would need to be reprogrammed, from a user perspective... if I  can earn 200% staking on SOL and 200% staking on ETH - what value does the application on ETH provide? And to address the real issue, if I earn 200% and then burn my gains to cover ETH gas fees, what real value is created?  This is what I think that cyrpto defi heads like me are figuring out, especially with the launch of Raydium. I am no whale, so the fees matter...

There is reported to be good amount of development for SOL right now. All the tools are almost in place. Wallets, stable coins, DEX, AMM, Etc. But, I do think one of the biggest pieces missing is a marketplace like AAVE.

The only remaining fees will be on lower and lower valued bitcoin.  Some miners may remain and maybe just barely break even on transaction fees on an ever lower valued bitcoin.

The hash rates will get easier, making it easier for those to remain to generate blocks.  But they will be competing for transaction fees of smaller and smaller value.  Eventually it will all reduce down to the point where bitcoin is actually valued according to its fitness for its original purpose: it will be an anonymous decentralized cryptocurrency whose tokens are as valuable as its use as a transaction processing network.

,SolanaGoddess,,,,"I'll caveat this by saying I'm not an expert. I'm a crypto professional who's been following the project, reading the transparency reports, and have close friends who work at trading desks and have been accumulating SOL.

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98. Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock?

None of this is investment advice, and I will admit I'm heavily biased as I have accumulated the large, large majority of my portfolio in SOL. But I think over the next few days the market will start to take notice of these facts. TheCryptoDog (with &gt;250k followers) has been tweeting this too: [https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784)

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree.  The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0% commission, like Everstake.

I also agree that no-commission validation is not sustainable.  These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base.  I don't quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though, given that they've attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere. 

I run a validator and I have 8% commission which I think is pretty close to the average.

Within a given commission range, you can also look at the total number of votes being cast, since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting.  Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible, then the overall take will be as large as possible (but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers).

On validators.app, you can see this in the ""Skipped Vote % (distance from leader)"" metric.  The closer to 0, the better (so -0.40% is better than -1.0%), because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer.

So basically there are two factors: how close to optimally the validator is voting (represented by very small skipped vote %) and what commission the validator is taking.  Of the two, unless the skipped vote % is very high, the commission will make the larger difference.

My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0.25% of the very best (represented by values like -0.24% on validators.app).  But I charge 8% commission.

Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network - it makes it more centralized and reduces its security.  So if you want to do what's best for Solana itself, you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators.  Maybe something like 3/4 of your stake on big low-fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators?

That's what I did when I started.  I picked 6 - two in the top 10, two in the 10 - 30 range, and two in the 30 - 100 range (in total stake ranking).  I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission.

2. The state of mind of the development team is an essential factor. I think it takes time for something to grow. Along the way, you will get setbacks. Therefore you need to stay strong in your vision. And communicate with your community to keep a solid foundation. For example, Solana is a big competitor of Ethereum. They won‚Äôt allow Solana to come into their space without a ‚Äúfight‚Äù.

3. Solana was launched in March 2020. So to me, it's relatively new. And for a while, DiFi was focussing on Ethereum. With the heavy gas fees, people are now looking for alternatives, where speed and costs are essential. Solana brings speed and cheap transaction fees. Although 50000 TPS still need to be proven.

1. Its not their fault or problem that ETH was not scalable and able to handle the amount of transactions that come through the block chain or able to handle the data needed on transactions. Innovation takes trial and error. They tried ETH cause at the time it was the best option, then quickly realized that it was going to work. Didn't screw any ETH supporters, invest in ETH not KIN if thats your priority.
2. The money raised has went to incredible developments. Its not Kin's fault that they got hit with the lawsuit and had to dig themselves out of the whole. I applaud them for not laying down and fighting back at the SEC.
3. They went to stellar cause stellar could handle more transactions than ETH but guess what, they maxed out that block chain too. Their are people and apps sitting on the sidelines right now ready to join in the ecosystem as soon as it can scale so the move to Solana is the only way to make that happen. You say they joined stellar probably just cause they received funding.

It's why I got super excited about Bitcoin in 2011 but only bought 3 coins once I realized that the entire design is self-limiting in its transaction processing speed which means that it can never serve the purpose that it pretended to serve, which was as an anonymous decentralized form of money.  What I unfortunately did not realize at the time was that the market valuation of Bitcoin was not going to be based on its actual fitness for its supposed purpose, but more on speculation and hype.  Had I realized that I would be a much richer person than I am now :)

Solana gets me excited about cryptocurrency in the way that the original Bitcoin whitepaper did back then, but with Solana I see a system that can actually achieve the transaction speed and cost necessary to actually operate as a currency.  What I do not know is how much hype is necessary to allow Solana to thrive and whether or not that level of hype will be achieved.

There are also many aspects of Solana that I wonder about the technical soundness of, mostly because I do not understand Solana.  There is no clear, comprehensive, and complete white paper like there was for Bitcoin.  I read the Bitcoin whitepaper and could understand everything about it.

To celebrate these milestones, the Solana Foundation will be releasing a bi-weekly ecosystem update highlighting the vast array of projects using the Solana blockchain. Among these projects include unique wallet solutions, decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, staking platforms, digital games, storage solutions, and much more.

However, you need people out there to actually submit 50,000 TPS for there to be that many transactions to even process, and right now there are only about 1,000 transactions per second being submitted (with most of those being votes).

So there is a lot of unused capacity in the Solana network right now.  It will take some time before enough apps and things have been built on Solana for those transaction counts to start creeping up into the tens of thousands.

I don't know anything about DOT.  Does it have a real, functioning, working network right now or is it just another idea waiting to be realized (which for most, never seems to happen)?

I bought 3 bitcoins in 2011.  Should have bought much more but I could see that the transaction rate would never be sufficient to do what people were claiming it would do at the time, which was become a global currency used by end-users everywhere.  So I lost interest.  I sold two of them when they were at $600 apiece, figuring that a 20x return was about the best I could expect.  I still have the last one, which I will hold until it either nets me enough money that I don't need any more, or it becomes worthless.

By the way, in 2011 I was also really concerned with the 'bitcoin founder' holding millions of BTC that he/she/they minted in the first year or two before bitcoin was even public.  I thought, why would I get involved in a currency where one single entity already owns most of it?  Unfortunately I did not realize that most/all of that bitcoin was lost, the private keys probably never even stored but thrown away immediately.  Surely if they were kept someone would have sold some of those bitcoin by now.

My point being, my understanding back then of the early mover advantage - I thought I had already missed the boat on Bitcoin in 2011, not realize that *I* was the early mover - really cost me a lot.  I am hoping not to make that same mistake with Solana.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I personally am concerned by a few things:

a. The fact that there is no comprehensive description of how the system works that can be scrutinized by experts.  There are some high level descriptions available of the various pieces but nothing comprehensive.  I am pretty sure that most of it just evolved in code as the developers figured out how to make it work.  As a result, I don't think anyone can say for sure whether or not there are fundamental weaknesses that haven't been realized yet.

b. It seems to require an awful lot of network communication between peers and not all of the network is decentralized -- there are unique and specific endpoints that most users have to go through.  I suspect that the validators, even though they mostly coordinate through decentralized means, probably still have some dependence on centralized servers for some aspects.  This is concerning because it creates a single point, or small number of points, of potential failure.

c. Many of the 'core' features that seem like they must be necessary to allow the system to work without being shepherded by enthusiasts, and which would be necessary in the face of attack by bad actors, do not seem to exist.  For example, slashing, which would be necessary to provide negative feedback to prevent attempts at double spends and such, are just placeholders with promises that ""we think it will probably work"", but as far as I can tell, no implementation at all.  So there are fundamental parts that are incomplete and I think the whole thing is working only because initial adopters, early enthusiasts, and the founders are working hard to keep everything going despite the whole thing not being complete yet.

d. This is not a concern about Solana itself but it is a concern just about the value of SOL tokens, which is only of interest to anyone hoping to 'get rich' off of early adoption.  SOL are not difficult to generate (that's the whole point of PoS over PoW) relative to the value that they provide.  The only reason to buy a SOL is to use it to pay for some transactions, but when transactions are very very cheap, you don't need to buy much SOL.  I think Bitcoin has shown that you don't actually need to be able to do anything *practically useful* with a cryptocurrency for people to place short term value on it (my theory is that its value goes to 0 when coins can no longer be minted and the only way for miners to make money is on transactions that people have no need to or desire to engage in), but when there is no (or very limited) artificial scarcity as in SOL, I do not know if utility is enough to give it much 'hype value'.  It's going up continuously right now but I don't know if that's because of clever pumping by whales, overall cryptocurrency hype, or actual interest by a large number of people.  I suspect it's a combination of all three but I don't know the exact ratios.",True,,0,1614187211,,1614187406.0,0,golpazt,False,t3_lrdnhm,False,t3_lrdnhm,/r/solana/comments/lrdnhm/solana_has_me_intrigued/golpazt/,,,10,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_golpazt,1627046834.0,

,silverknight781,,,,"Jay thank you so much for your explanation here and later in this thread, it's rare to find real finance people willing to explain to us noobs. 

I have being doing DD on Solana for weeks and finally got in around $3.50, in for the long term. Admittedly I am a little worried I'm getting in at fully diluted mc of close to $2b but honestly I think it can be much more even. 

A few questions if you'll entertain:
1) when dilution comes (80-90% by eoy?) How does it come on the market? Will they release in a way that takes into account the price action so as to not destroy the technicals, or is it a regular trickling release, or released but locked for certain time, etc? Would like to learn about the mechanics and thinking behind token releases. 

1.1) on August 14, 2020 the MC doubled, is that due to a release in coins? Is there anywhere to check for how/why the MC calculation changed, so one can see record of releases in the past? To an noob, it's weird to see a coins mc go up but price flat. Would also love to learn about thinking behind releasing coins gradually for new tokens as well.

Higher market cap &gt; higher block reward &gt; more mining farms until block reward only slightly above electricity cost &gt; bad for environment. It is only a matter of time until PoW based approaches need to be banned on a regulatory level for this reason alone. On top of it, it leads to scarce markets (Nvidia GPUs) which is a problem economically. Furthermore, the larger the mining farms need to be, the more it centralizes the entire operation, removing the security aspect as well because the few single miners can decide when to double spend etc. It may be a dead end, but PoS will eventually be more secure IMO. 

In ETH1 they sort of manage it for now by lowering block rewards every now and then to adjust for market cap, but that only works because they can sort of centrally update things like reward rates via network updates ‚Äì the blockchain itself does not use $ price as a factor to compute mining rewards.

Other PoW approaches like IOTA also dont convince me as it basically requires users of the network to burn the energy to make transactions. A battery powered IoT device should not need to do any computations more than necessary, such as PoW computations, just to do a tx.

With Solana, I like that Proof of History only seems to require a single CPU to continuously burn cycles to compute SHA hashes.

,silverknight781,,,,"Jay thank you so much for your explanation here and later in this thread, it's rare to find real finance people willing to explain to us noobs. 

I have being doing DD on Solana for weeks and finally got in around $3.50, in for the long term. Admittedly I am a little worried I'm getting in at fully diluted mc of close to $2b but honestly I think it can be much more even. 

A few questions if you'll entertain:
1) when dilution comes (80-90% by eoy?) How does it come on the market? Will they release in a way that takes into account the price action so as to not destroy the technicals, or is it a regular trickling release, or released but locked for certain time, etc? Would like to learn about the mechanics and thinking behind token releases. 

1.1) on August 14, 2020 the MC doubled, is that due to a release in coins? Is there anywhere to check for how/why the MC calculation changed, so one can see record of releases in the past? To an noob, it's weird to see a coins mc go up but price flat. Would also love to learn about thinking behind releasing coins gradually for new tokens as well. 

2) on the tech side, what are some other L1 solutions you think has promise? I have been looking around and honestly cannot find anyone even close to SOL's credibility.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I have been pondering the same questions.  A few points:

- I *think*, but do not know, that the Solana Foundation/founders are staking new Validators with about 200,000 SOL token.  If you look at the list of validators from solanabeach.io, you will notice that alot of the 'newer' smaller ones are staked with the same amount in the 200,000 range.  This suggests to me that there is a policy in Solana of doing that at the moment.  Also when I asked a similar question earlier I was told by a co-founder to 'set up a node and sign up for tds and earn a grant'.

- I have done some rough pricing out of the 'medium sized' recommended specs for a validator and it's in the $5,000 - $6,000 range if you include a GPU.  Right now silicon is very hard to come by which is a problem.  Incredibly inflated prices on GPUs, somewhat less but still terrible prices on CPUs.

- I have never colo'd so I don't know how much that costs.  I think that you can do it for less than $400 per month depending on where you are.  You need 1 Gbps fully unmetered which means you need to be in a colo facility.  I think that the only economical way to do that is with a rack mounted unit.  I am not an expert in rack mounted systems and from my research the simplest way to do it is with 4U form factor since you can fit basically stock PC parts in.

- I do not know what you mean by ""I'm in the US, so unfortunately unable to earn foundation rewards"".  I say that because I actually don't know anything, not because I am challenging what you say.  In what way are US citizens hamstrung with regards to the Solana foundation?  I sincerely do not know and would appreciate any info you have ...

As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.  Then maybe upgrade a few components into the minimum viable voting node and try that for a while.  And then if the economics are working, jump into a full node for the $many thousands that takes to set up.

I also encourage anyone with actual experience to share on this thread.

I think part of the reason that people are likely hesitant to share, however, is that existing validators do not want competition.  They want the ecosystem to only be healthy enough with enough validators to do the job, and no more than that, because more validators than strictly necessary just cuts into their profits.

EDIT: By the way, just keep in mind that if you don't risk anything, then you cannot hope for any rewards.  A few thousands of dollars risk is nothing compared to the potential payoff, but you do have to be prepared to lose some thousands and chalk it up to a moon shot that didn't work if it fails.",True,,0,1614192920,,1614193127.0,0,gom4l1x,False,t3_lrjr6l,False,t3_lrjr6l,/r/solana/comments/lrjr6l/validator_node_economics/gom4l1x/,,,4,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gom4l1x,1627047436.0,

I just tried to create another new one, it showed up. I cancel it, it was deleted, the usdt went to unsettled status, I settled them, usdt back in the balance. I compared the steps in the # between the two orders and I don't see any differences between them in the steps. In an another one # I see the cancel and later again in an another one the settle funds transaction.

UPDATE: after (like) another hour of searching...

So I started to look step by step through all the single steps with the order creation transaction and checked all the addresses that were used during that creation. While doing this I recognized, the market address raydium for the ray-usdt pair did changed. So I added manually in the url the old one address that was in my order creation # for the market et voil√† suddenly I could see my order! The pair is quoted as RAY/USDT-V2 whatever USDT-V2 now means. So I did all the steps, cancel, settle and all funds now back in my wallet.

False,GhettoCryptoz,volunteer,,Dom (Volunteer Mod),"Here‚Äôs my understanding to date, I'm only assisting with community moderation. Not actually part of the team. But here goes: 

In it‚Äôs simplest form Proof of History (PoH) is a clock for blockchain.

However, unlike traditional methods where messages within the network are timestamped. Proof of History is a methodology to prove whether a certain message occurred sometime before or after an event. 

For example ‚Äì when you take a selfie with yourself and a newspaper article in it. You are essentially creating proof that your photograph was taken AFTER the newspaper was published. This is exactly what Proof of History does ‚Äì it enables the network to create a historical record to prove that a specific event occurred at a specific moment of time. You can learn more about PoH here: 

And it can do so in an objective, and decentralised manner. 

What does this mean in layman‚Äôs terms? 
Well this essentially means that nodes downstream can then verify the time and order of events within the network WITHOUT witnessing them directly. 

It‚Äôs important to note that PoH is NOT a consensus protocol. It instead adds valuable data (an objective measure of time) to the blockchain.                                                                                   

By adding this valuable data, it allows Solana to optimize other elements of the system without compromising key features or security. Some of these features include ‚ÄúAvalanche‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of Replication‚Äù, and together they allow Solana to achieve sub-second finality and maintain high throughput with minimal loss in finality time - even after the number of nodes on the network increase substantially. 

* Proof of Replication - To get slightly technical on how PoH allows Solana to optimize Proof of Replication (PoRep) by having a sense of time on the blokckchain, the network then doesn‚Äôt need to re-order the CBC blocks. Traditional systems, have to re-order the blocks because they don‚Äôt have an agreed sense of time, and this process is typically expensive. 
* Avalanche - I won‚Äôt get into the technical details of Avalanche ‚Äì and I‚Äôll let you learn from the master himself (the CTO of Solana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=144s

US entities are unable to get SOL rewards for participating in their test net initiatives, like TdS for example (so the recommendation to get started there is useless for me unfortunately).

&gt;As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.

I thought about this as well and am mulling it over. Not a bad idea at all. If I recall I think you can get on their testnet to get familiar with it.

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).

So, i replied with one sentence like yous asked for.

**You Question :** Is it designed to support or replace ? If so what ?

**Answer:** Solana wasn't created to "" replace or to be a killer "" for other blockchains like some are claiming, Solana is just focusing on developing its own blockchain, make the blockchain technology even more revolutionary, solve real use cases thanks to its 8 Innovations, you can read more about those specific innovations in this link below :

,silverknight781,,,,"Jay thank you so much for your explanation here and later in this thread, it's rare to find real finance people willing to explain to us noobs. 

I have being doing DD on Solana for weeks and finally got in around $3.50, in for the long term. Admittedly I am a little worried I'm getting in at fully diluted mc of close to $2b but honestly I think it can be much more even. 

A few questions if you'll entertain:
1) when dilution comes (80-90% by eoy?) How does it come on the market? Will they release in a way that takes into account the price action so as to not destroy the technicals, or is it a regular trickling release, or released but locked for certain time, etc? Would like to learn about the mechanics and thinking behind token releases. 

1.1) on August 14, 2020 the MC doubled, is that due to a release in coins? Is there anywhere to check for how/why the MC calculation changed, so one can see record of releases in the past? To an noob, it's weird to see a coins mc go up but price flat. Would also love to learn about thinking behind releasing coins gradually for new tokens as well. 

2) on the tech side, what are some other L1 solutions you think has promise? I have been looking around and honestly cannot find anyone even close to SOL's credibility.

besides being cumbersome to read through and difficult to use they only mint .svg and .png files. that means no video files which is out of the question for me at the moment. the other huge one is that this would limit the sales of my NFT's to the [Solible.com](https://Solible.com) platform which receives a fraction of the traffic that a major platform like Nifty, Opensea, or even Rareble and Superrare.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"Valdators *may lose money in the future if slashing is implemented* if they attempt to be malicious.

I see this happen alot - people mix things that are true and verifiable, with things that are theoretical and not implemented, and it causes a lot of confusion.

Inflation is implemented and happening right now.  It's around 8% per year, and will reduce a little bit each year, until it hits a constant 1.5% in about 11 years.  Here is all the details on that:

https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/ed_overview/ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_protocol_based_rewards

Slashing - the mechanism for punishing validators who break the rules - is NOT implemented.  It's all theory right now.

The only concrete thing that slashing has been proposed to be used for is for punishing validators who break the voting rules -- the rules are that validators are not supposed to 'switch forks' for a certain amount of time after voting on a fork (if there are two forks and a validator chooses to vote on fork A and not B, then that validator is committed to only voting on fork A for a certain period of time; if the validator wants to switch to fork B because it believes that fork has become the better fork, it must wait to do so but not voting on fork A for a while until it has satisfied the waiting period, then it can switch to voting on fork B; this is to provide the mechanism that forces validators to commit to forks which then allows forks to win or lose; if every validator voted on every fork, then no fork would ever die and there would just be more and more forks).

But there is noting right now preventing a validator from breaking those rules and voting on multiple forks at once.  In fact, validators are kind of economically incentivized to do so because they will be guaranteed to get more votes in, which makes more money.  As far as I know, validators are currently being honest and following the fork voting rules; but if they are doing so, it's just out of honesty.  There is no penalty for being dishonest, because there is no slashing implemented.  (Also, i would take expertise and work to modify the validator code to allow this kind of multi-fork voting, and nobody with the time and expertise has been motivated to do that, as far as I know.)

Then there are nebulous claims that slashing could be implemented to deal with provably malicious validators - for example a validator which can be shown to have tried to consistently cheat with false transactions or something like that, or which has a pattern of creating unnecessary forks so flagrantly that it must be malicious, etc.  The mechanism for this slashing has never been fully explained, just hinted at.  But because deciding on guilt would involve some degree of human judgement, it's hard to see how this would happen without the Solana Foundation just coding the slash directly into the validator code and convincing all the validators to accept that new software that enforces the slash.  The foundation has great power here because most validators will just blindly go along with whatever the foundation says, and will install whatever new version of the validator software the foundation makes.

If this all seems a little unsatisfactory to you, then we're in agreement.  I think the foundation needs to implement a mechanism for automated slashing of validators who violate vote rules.  But I guess this will take some time.

In the meantime, talking about slashing like it exists now, is misleading.",True,,0,1617939209,,1617939557.0,0,gtw4bnz,False,t3_mn27en,False,t1_gtvsl39,/r/solana/comments/mn27en/new_to_solana/gtw4bnz/,,,9,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtw4bnz,1628361439.0,False

It's why I got super excited about Bitcoin in 2011 but only bought 3 coins once I realized that the entire design is self-limiting in its transaction processing speed which means that it can never serve the purpose that it pretended to serve, which was as an anonymous decentralized form of money.  What I unfortunately did not realize at the time was that the market valuation of Bitcoin was not going to be based on its actual fitness for its supposed purpose, but more on speculation and hype.  Had I realized that I would be a much richer person than I am now :)

Solana gets me excited about cryptocurrency in the way that the original Bitcoin whitepaper did back then, but with Solana I see a system that can actually achieve the transaction speed and cost necessary to actually operate as a currency.  What I do not know is how much hype is necessary to allow Solana to thrive and whether or not that level of hype will be achieved.

There are also many aspects of Solana that I wonder about the technical soundness of, mostly because I do not understand Solana.  There is no clear, comprehensive, and complete white paper like there was for Bitcoin.  I read the Bitcoin whitepaper and could understand everything about it.  With Solana there are bits and pieces of generalized algorithms described but most of the technical details are probably just artifacts of how the code happens to be written.  That is disappointing to me.

That page focuses on slashing as a way to enforce the rule that validators are only allowed to vote on one fork for some period of time.  This makes sense because requiring validators to be committed to a fork is the mechanism whereby consensus is created.

However, there is also mention from time to time of more egregious slashing penalties for ""malicious"" validator behavior.  It wasn't made clear in the docs but I'm guessing that this would be done by the 'central authority' who would decide to hard code the slash in code and put it in the next software release.  The validators would then 'vote' for that by taking that version of the software.  Once a majority of validators have done so, the slash is accepted by virtue of being enforced since the slash is now running on the majority of nodes.

This puts a lot of power in the hands of the developers who control the software.  Because I think we can all assume that validators *want* to stay up to date with software releases and so there is *a lot* of inertia built into the system.  Certainly some less than optimal choices by the foundation could be carried through just on that inertia.  This is worrisome.

The comforting part is that the foundation is very motivated to do the right thing, knowing that the entire success of solana depends on validator and end-user mindshare, which would be highly compromised by nefarious actions on the part of the foundation.

In the end I think it's a pipe dream for anyone to think that any of these systems is truly decentralized.

üö® NOTICE - SPL Wrapped USDT is being phased out! üö®

With the recent launch of native SPL USDT on Solana, the ecosystem is phasing out SPL Wrapped USDT (WUSDT). 

If you are currently providing liquidity/farming RAY-WUSDT, you will need to migrate to a new RAY-USDT pool soon. We are working on a migration tool to make the process as straightforward as possible. 

We're also considering to add a WUSDT-to-USDT converter directly into 'Swap' so everyone can simply select the two assets and swap to convert.

The new RAY-USDT pool will go live in approx 24 hrs. Make sure to cancel any open RAY-WUSDT orders you have on the trading DEX page before that.

I'll caveat this by saying I'm not an expert. I'm a crypto professional who's been following the project, reading the transparency reports, and have close friends who work at trading desks and have been accumulating SOL.

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98. Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock?

None of this is investment advice, and I will admit I'm heavily biased as I have accumulated the large, large majority of my portfolio in SOL. But I think over the next few days the market will start to take notice of these facts. TheCryptoDog (with &gt;250k followers) has been tweeting this too: [https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784)

And the supply is only going to keep increasing due to inflation.

Also the foundation seems pretty greedy.  They locked a huge amount of SOL up for themselves.  And they have methods for increasing their supply (part of the transaction fees includes a percentage going directly to the foundation, which currently is 0%, but could be raised in future).  I don't mind at the outset where they are using that SOL as leverage to build the ecosystem (via rewards and staking grants, and eventually staking pool grants).

That page focuses on slashing as a way to enforce the rule that validators are only allowed to vote on one fork for some period of time.  This makes sense because requiring validators to be committed to a fork is the mechanism whereby consensus is created.

However, there is also mention from time to time of more egregious slashing penalties for ""malicious"" validator behavior.  It wasn't made clear in the docs but I'm guessing that this would be done by the 'central authority' who would decide to hard code the slash in code and put it in the next software release.  The validators would then 'vote' for that by taking that version of the software.  Once a majority of validators have done so, the slash is accepted by virtue of being enforced since the slash is now running on the majority of nodes.

This puts a lot of power in the hands of the developers who control the software.  Because I think we can all assume that validators *want* to stay up to date with software releases and so there is *a lot* of inertia built into the system.  Certainly some less than optimal choices by the foundation could be carried through just on that inertia.  This is worrisome.

2. Politics.  
Scaling is also a matter of strategy and therefore politics. Ethereum has been plagued by them for some time (Endless Eth 2.0 and scaling debates).

Proof of History (PoH) is a globally-available, permissionless source of time in the network that works before consensus. POH is not a consensus protocol or anti-Sybil mechanism. Rather, POH is a solution to the clock problem.

Whereas other blockchains require validators to talk to one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF)

False,nossocc,,,,"I think Solana is a very promising project. In my opinion a problem with the crypto space is that a lot of the community and developers are quite new engineers. Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?"" I don't know. But in terms of a long term investment in my opinion Solana is solid, it's just that right now it's probably overvalued like everything else.

,TangeloNightmare,founder,,Eric (Co-Founder),"Thanks for the question u/Omisebro, I think some of the confusion may just be terminology. Let me try to clarify

&gt;I was intrigued by Solana and it‚Äôs team, but when I read it was using a derivative of DPoS and PBFT I was pretty disappointed. From my understanding PBFT l doesn‚Äôt scale well at all with additional nodes, which means there will need to be white-listed nodes to keep scalability reasonable. Even PoH (while smart and cool) is just an incremental improvement and doesn‚Äôt result in a revolutionary iteration of BFT that solves it‚Äôs inherent terrible scalability with added nodes

Actually PoH does address this side effect of traditional PBFT. It separates the time component from the consensus component. I.e. in traditional PBFT, the network proceeds (time) in a lock-step fashion, each step requiring the network to come to consensus, so the bottleneck, wrt to progression, is the network communication overhead necessary to agree on the ordering of the transactions to come to consensus. This means that more nodes --&gt; more communication --&gt; more time to consensus --&gt; scaling problems. This is, in effect, one of the main drivers of the ""inherent terrible scalability with added nodes"" you refer to (another component is the data propagation component, PoH helps here too and you can read about how [here](https://solana.com/turbine/) if interested).

PoH (i.e. the data structure of the Solana blockchain) provides a cryptographically verifiable sense of ordering to the messages, so nodes that receive the PoH data stream can trust/verify the ordering of the transactions on their own, without the node, and the network, having to put the breaks on transaction processing to wait for the rest of the nodes to agree on an ordering before continuing. So if I'm a Solana node, I can keep processing/validating transactions that are being broadcast from the rotating leaders ""optimistically"", without having the start/stop nature of traditional PBFT.  In the language of the [CAP theorem](https://towardsdatascience.com/cap-theorem-and-distributed-database-management-systems-5c2be977950e), you might say that Solana is an 'availability/liveness' preferring chain, rather than traditional PBFT which leans toward 'consistency'. 

Our consensus mechanism ([TowerBFT](https://solana.com/tower-bft/)), is then layered on top of this - resolving forks that may arise rather than being the limiting factor in network progression.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So it seems from the documentation that stake will be delegated to nodes (how many will be on mainnet? 21?) so these delegators get to choose who is whitelisted? Even then what dies Solana have in place to prevent the alleged cartels that have formed in EOS?

I think this may be where some of the terminology confusion comes in. Perhaps DPOS isn't the correct terminology (has EOS fully appropriated this terminology?).  We allow delegation of stake to validators -  while at the same time our validator network is fully permissionless (in fact, with our incentivized testnet just about to kick off, you should feel free to [spin a validator node up yourself](https://solana-labs.github.io/book-edge/testnet-participation.html)). 

To be clear: there is no whitelist for validators/delegators on our network.  On mainnet, anyone can become a validator, accept delegations, earn rewards, etc.

We've done test of the network, spinning up 200 GPU nodes across multiple regions for benchmarking purposes (50ktps!), but there are no (lower or upper) requirements on the number of mainnet nodes. We expect the number of mainnet nodes to be driven more by the economics of the validation ecosystem :)",True,False,0,1569050646,,False,0,f0xwjo8,False,t3_d6it97,True,t3_d6it97,/r/solana/comments/d6it97/how_does_solana_intend_to_prevent_validator/f0xwjo8/,,1577308424.0,3,,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,dark,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Eric (Co-Founder)'}]",richtext,1524159918.0,t2_17wvk126,False,,r/solana,{},False,False,[],[],False,[],0.0,,,,False,,,,,,,

In it‚Äôs simplest form Proof of History (PoH) is a clock for blockchain.

However, unlike traditional methods where messages within the network are timestamped. Proof of History is a methodology to prove whether a certain message occurred sometime before or after an event. 

For example ‚Äì when you take a selfie with yourself and a newspaper article in it. You are essentially creating proof that your photograph was taken AFTER the newspaper was published. This is exactly what Proof of History does ‚Äì it enables the network to create a historical record to prove that a specific event occurred at a specific moment of time. You can learn more about PoH here: 

And it can do so in an objective, and decentralised manner. 

What does this mean in layman‚Äôs terms? 
Well this essentially means that nodes downstream can then verify the time and order of events within the network WITHOUT witnessing them directly. 

It‚Äôs important to note that PoH is NOT a consensus protocol. It instead adds valuable data (an objective measure of time) to the blockchain.                                                                                   

By adding this valuable data, it allows Solana to optimize other elements of the system without compromising key features or security. Some of these features include ‚ÄúAvalanche‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of Replication‚Äù, and together they allow Solana to achieve sub-second finality and maintain high throughput with minimal loss in finality time - even after the number of nodes on the network increase substantially. 

* Proof of Replication - To get slightly technical on how PoH allows Solana to optimize Proof of Replication (PoRep) by having a sense of time on the blokckchain, the network then doesn‚Äôt need to re-order the CBC blocks. Traditional systems, have to re-order the blocks because they don‚Äôt have an agreed sense of time, and this process is typically expensive. 
* Avalanche - I won‚Äôt get into the technical details of Avalanche ‚Äì and I‚Äôll let you learn from the master himself (the CTO of Solana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=144s

3. They went to stellar cause stellar could handle more transactions than ETH but guess what, they maxed out that block chain too.

False,nossocc,,,,"I think Solana is a very promising project. In my opinion a problem with the crypto space is that a lot of the community and developers are quite new engineers. Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?"" I don't know. But in terms of a long term investment in my opinion Solana is solid, it's just that right now it's probably overvalued like everything else.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree.  The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0% commission, like Everstake.

I also agree that no-commission validation is not sustainable.  These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base.  I don't quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though, given that they've attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere. 

I run a validator and I have 8% commission which I think is pretty close to the average.

Within a given commission range, you can also look at the total number of votes being cast, since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting.  Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible, then the overall take will be as large as possible (but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers).

On validators.app, you can see this in the ""Skipped Vote % (distance from leader)"" metric.  The closer to 0, the better (so -0.40% is better than -1.0%), because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer.

So basically there are two factors: how close to optimally the validator is voting (represented by very small skipped vote %) and what commission the validator is taking.  Of the two, unless the skipped vote % is very high, the commission will make the larger difference.

My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0.25% of the very best (represented by values like -0.24% on validators.app).  But I charge 8% commission.

Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network - it makes it more centralized and reduces its security.  So if you want to do what's best for Solana itself, you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators.  Maybe something like 3/4 of your stake on big low-fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators?

That's what I did when I started.  I picked 6 - two in the top 10, two in the 10 - 30 range, and two in the 30 - 100 range (in total stake ranking).  I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission.  The overall difference was only like 1% APY but still perceptible.",True,,0,1616890469,,False,0,gsj0er9,False,t3_meiwg6,True,t1_gshz1dp,/r/solana/comments/meiwg6/choosing_a_validator_for_max_rewards/gsj0er9/,,,2,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gsj0er9,1627294853.0,

We‚Äôre happy to announce the opening of the *Nomination Period* for *Inflation Candidates*. This is the first of three steps in the community governance process proposed [here 1](https://forums.solana.com/t/proposal-for-community-vote-process-to-enable-full-inflation-on-mainnet-beta/1060) for enabling full inflation on Mainnet Beta!

### Nomination Period - What is it?

Starting today, Friday Jan 29th at 9:00am PST and over the next 7 days, ending Friday Feb 5th at 9:00am PST, the Solana Foundation will be collecting nominations of folks who are interested in becoming eligible to become an *Inflation Candidate* and potentially garner enough community votes to be granted the ability to enable [full inflation 5](https://forums.solana.com/t/final-inflation-parameter-proposal-and-steps-to-implementation/977/4) on Mainnet Beta

### How to nominate an Inflation Candidate?

There are three steps to becoming a nomination candidate

1. Email **nominations@solana.foundation** and we will respond providing you with a unique pubkey. This address will be used to identify the candidate‚Äôs Inflation Candidate Feature Proposal.
2. Generate your own keypair using: solana-keygen new -o inflation.json  
. Keep it safe, if you are successfully elected during the *Voting Period* this keypair can be used to enable full-inflation via: solana feature activate inflation.json  
.
3. Submit your nomination! Fork the [solana project 2](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana), apply the contents of [this 2](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/14724) template to your fork and submit a pull request. You‚Äôll be adding the two keys generated above to the template: *Vote Address* from step 1 and *Enable Address* from step 2 along with an identifier labelled with the placeholder ""my\_name‚Äù. The core team will help you merge your PR but you might be required to make minor formatting or other changes to ensure that it compiles successfully.

Once these steps are completed, you will have submitted a nomination for *Inflation Candidate*!

### Then what happens?

At the close of the *Nomination Period* (next Friday), a new Solana build will be shipped that includes all of the nominations described above (i.e. the release will include all of the nominee pull requests). If that release is adopted by the majority of the validators on the network, the [Feature Proposals 1](https://spl.solana.com/feature-proposal) for all of the *Inflation Candidates* will be then initiated by the Solana Foundation and the *Voting Period* will begin.

As mentioned above, a new release will be generated that includes all of the nominations submitted over the *Nomination Period*. The *Voting Period* will begin if/when 95% of the validators upgrade to that release version on Mainnet Beta. From past upgrades, we expect this to take a few days so it is likely that the *Voting Period* may begin Tuesday or Wednesday (Feb 9th or 10th) the following week.

During the *Voting Period* the Solana Foundation will post the instructions on how to vote along with the *Inflation Candidate* identifiers and *Vote Addresses* that were collected during the *Nomination Period*.

Once any *Inflation Candidate* receives &gt;66% of the Vote SPL Tokens submitted to their Feature Proposal acceptance address, they will automatically be able to enable the full-inflation feature for Mainnet Beta, using the inflation.json  
 keypair they generated which contains the *Enable Address*.

The Solana Foundation does not support, endorse, or object to any vote, measure, or decision put forward to the Solana ecosystem. The Solana Foundation does not vote on Solana voting proposals and does not participate in the voting process outside of, from time to time, providing administrative support to certain aspects of the voting process.

The fact that Solana only proves relative time is no problem for the application I envision. 

Let us say we have the following configuration:

1) Both the device that will be challenged, and the challenging hardware are controlled by the attacker

2) the attacker also controls the local Solana node that is physically close to the device to be challenged. The fact it is part of the Solana network and cannot let bad behavior be detected limits its options, but it still has options.

3) the challenge hardware takes PoH Hash N as input into its challenge query data, and stores the response from the device as a user-generated hash in PoH hash N+1.

I was wondering whether an upper bound on time could be observed and validated by the Solana ledger. In my example above, I am looking for a way for the remote validators to put a cap on Delta T\_max, in [this schematic](https://imgur.com/a/NtRr62e). 

The dashed vertical lines are ""synchronization"" lines (I did not read the white paper in detail yet, so I am just postulating there is such a mechanism), the small red lines are individual PoH hashes, nodes 1 and 2 are ""honest"" nodes, and node 3 runs faster first, to get ahead a little, then gives extra time to the device to compute a counterfeit response to the challenge, and resumes fast hashing to meet the next synchronization deadline.

I am looking for a way where the challenge response validators would only accept the response to the challenge if some conditions, allowing to cap Delta T Max, are met. 

In other words, how could the local Solana node reliably prove to the network that the challenge response was made with a Delta T\_max of less than, say, 1 ¬µs?

The point is to give strong assurance to the network that the external device did not have enough time to forge a counterfeit response before the challenge data became obsolete, and therefore, that it had to use the honest way to answer, as it would be the only way to submit an answer in time.

In it‚Äôs simplest form Proof of History (PoH) is a clock for blockchain.

However, unlike traditional methods where messages within the network are timestamped. Proof of History is a methodology to prove whether a certain message occurred sometime before or after an event. 

For example ‚Äì when you take a selfie with yourself and a newspaper article in it. You are essentially creating proof that your photograph was taken AFTER the newspaper was published. This is exactly what Proof of History does ‚Äì it enables the network to create a historical record to prove that a specific event occurred at a specific moment of time. You can learn more about PoH here: 

And it can do so in an objective, and decentralised manner. 

What does this mean in layman‚Äôs terms? 
Well this essentially means that nodes downstream can then verify the time and order of events within the network WITHOUT witnessing them directly. 

It‚Äôs important to note that PoH is NOT a consensus protocol. It instead adds valuable data (an objective measure of time) to the blockchain.                                                                                   

By adding this valuable data, it allows Solana to optimize other elements of the system without compromising key features or security. Some of these features include ‚ÄúAvalanche‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of Replication‚Äù, and together they allow Solana to achieve sub-second finality and maintain high throughput with minimal loss in finality time - even after the number of nodes on the network increase substantially. 

* Proof of Replication - To get slightly technical on how PoH allows Solana to optimize Proof of Replication (PoRep) by having a sense of time on the blokckchain, the network then doesn‚Äôt need to re-order the CBC blocks. Traditional systems, have to re-order the blocks because they don‚Äôt have an agreed sense of time, and this process is typically expensive. 
* Avalanche - I won‚Äôt get into the technical details of Avalanche ‚Äì and I‚Äôll let you learn from the master himself (the CTO of Solana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt_gDRXHrHQ&amp;t=144s

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98. Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock?

None of this is investment advice, and I will admit I'm heavily biased as I have accumulated the large, large majority of my portfolio in SOL.

I see this happen alot - people mix things that are true and verifiable, with things that are theoretical and not implemented, and it causes a lot of confusion.

Inflation is implemented and happening right now.  It's around 8% per year, and will reduce a little bit each year, until it hits a constant 1.5% in about 11 years.  Here is all the details on that:

https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/ed_overview/ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_protocol_based_rewards

Slashing - the mechanism for punishing validators who break the rules - is NOT implemented.  It's all theory right now.

The only concrete thing that slashing has been proposed to be used for is for punishing validators who break the voting rules -- the rules are that validators are not supposed to 'switch forks' for a certain amount of time after voting on a fork (if there are two forks and a validator chooses to vote on fork A and not B, then that validator is committed to only voting on fork A for a certain period of time; if the validator wants to switch to fork B because it believes that fork has become the better fork, it must wait to do so but not voting on fork A for a while until it has satisfied the waiting period, then it can switch to voting on fork B; this is to provide the mechanism that forces validators to commit to forks which then allows forks to win or lose; if every validator voted on every fork, then no fork would ever die and there would just be more and more forks).

But there is noting right now preventing a validator from breaking those rules and voting on multiple forks at once.  In fact, validators are kind of economically incentivized to do so because they will be guaranteed to get more votes in, which makes more money.  As far as I know, validators are currently being honest and following the fork voting rules; but if they are doing so, it's just out of honesty.  There is no penalty for being dishonest, because there is no slashing implemented.  (Also, i would take expertise and work to modify the validator code to allow this kind of multi-fork voting, and nobody with the time and expertise has been motivated to do that, as far as I know.)

Then there are nebulous claims that slashing could be implemented to deal with provably malicious validators - for example a validator which can be shown to have tried to consistently cheat with false transactions or something like that, or which has a pattern of creating unnecessary forks so flagrantly that it must be malicious, etc.  The mechanism for this slashing has never been fully explained, just hinted at.  But because deciding on guilt would involve some degree of human judgement, it's hard to see how this would happen without the Solana Foundation just coding the slash directly into the validator code and convincing all the validators to accept that new software that enforces the slash.  The foundation has great power here because most validators will just blindly go along with whatever the foundation says, and will install whatever new version of the validator software the foundation makes.

If this all seems a little unsatisfactory to you, then we're in agreement.  I think the foundation needs to implement a mechanism for automated slashing of validators who violate vote rules.  But I guess this will take some time.

I just tried to create another new one, it showed up. I cancel it, it was deleted, the usdt went to unsettled status, I settled them, usdt back in the balance. I compared the steps in the # between the two orders and I don't see any differences between them in the steps. In an another one # I see the cancel and later again in an another one the settle funds transaction.

UPDATE: after (like) another hour of searching...

So I started to look step by step through all the single steps with the order creation transaction and checked all the addresses that were used during that creation. While doing this I recognized, the market address raydium for the ray-usdt pair did changed. So I added manually in the url the old one address that was in my order creation # for the market et voil√† suddenly I could see my order! The pair is quoted as RAY/USDT-V2 whatever USDT-V2 now means. So I did all the steps, cancel, settle and all funds now back in my wallet.

Sorry if I miss a ""feature"" here at this point or missed an info or an update, but thats really annoying. I mean, I spend back than to trade hours and days on other famous eth-dex and ofc it was sometimes very buggy too. So, I am used to it.

Well it can take as long as you wish until you asked to UnStake / UnDelegate your staked SOl.

You can **UnStake / UnDelegate** whenever you want BUT keep in mind that you'll have to go through what is called **"" CoolDown""** , that may take till the the end of current Epoch during which you asked to **unstake**.

Two Possible Scenarios

The first scenario - If the price will continue its unstoppable surge then, it may reach up to $4.5 -$5 in no time after the potential test of the recent resistance that turns into support around 32,500- 33,000sats on a daily chart. From there, we need to see the price to rebound.

The second scenario - If the price will follow the Elliot wave count.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I personally am concerned by a few things:

a. The fact that there is no comprehensive description of how the system works that can be scrutinized by experts.  There are some high level descriptions available of the various pieces but nothing comprehensive.  I am pretty sure that most of it just evolved in code as the developers figured out how to make it work.  As a result, I don't think anyone can say for sure whether or not there are fundamental weaknesses that haven't been realized yet.

b. It seems to require an awful lot of network communication between peers and not all of the network is decentralized -- there are unique and specific endpoints that most users have to go through.  I suspect that the validators, even though they mostly coordinate through decentralized means, probably still have some dependence on centralized servers for some aspects.  This is concerning because it creates a single point, or small number of points, of potential failure.

c. Many of the 'core' features that seem like they must be necessary to allow the system to work without being shepherded by enthusiasts, and which would be necessary in the face of attack by bad actors, do not seem to exist.  For example, slashing, which would be necessary to provide negative feedback to prevent attempts at double spends and such, are just placeholders with promises that ""we think it will probably work"", but as far as I can tell, no implementation at all.  So there are fundamental parts that are incomplete and I think the whole thing is working only because initial adopters, early enthusiasts, and the founders are working hard to keep everything going despite the whole thing not being complete yet.

d. This is not a concern about Solana itself but it is a concern just about the value of SOL tokens, which is only of interest to anyone hoping to 'get rich' off of early adoption.  SOL are not difficult to generate (that's the whole point of PoS over PoW) relative to the value that they provide.  The only reason to buy a SOL is to use it to pay for some transactions, but when transactions are very very cheap, you don't need to buy much SOL.  I think Bitcoin has shown that you don't actually need to be able to do anything *practically useful* with a cryptocurrency for people to place short term value on it (my theory is that its value goes to 0 when coins can no longer be minted and the only way for miners to make money is on transactions that people have no need to or desire to engage in), but when there is no (or very limited) artificial scarcity as in SOL, I do not know if utility is enough to give it much 'hype value'.  It's going up continuously right now but I don't know if that's because of clever pumping by whales, overall cryptocurrency hype, or actual interest by a large number of people.  I suspect it's a combination of all three but I don't know the exact ratios.",True,,0,1614187211,,1614187406.0,0,golpazt,False,t3_lrdnhm,False,t3_lrdnhm,/r/solana/comments/lrdnhm/solana_has_me_intrigued/golpazt/,,,10,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,[],,False,,0.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_golpazt,1627046834.0,

,DigitalInstincts,founder,,Raj (Co-Founder),"Hey! I'm the Solana Labs COO, Raj Gokal. Thanks for the question! I'll get right to the answer:

Solana is completely open. Any validators can join the network. It's a PoS system called ""[Tower BFT](https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79)"" based on pBFT, but delegation is an option for any token holders. You can see a list of all the current validators, their performance, and stake weights at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io), and even go become a validator by dropping into the [validator docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator).

There is no maximum number of nodes that the network can manage or will allow. There will never be a limit to the number of nodes that can join. The network is completely open and permissionless, and always will be.

Our block propagation protocol ""[Turbine](https://medium.com/solana-labs/turbine-solanas-block-propagation-protocol-solves-the-scalability-trilemma-2ddba46a51db)"" allows for a ""logarithmic"" increase of finality times with the number of nodes. This means the network *does* slow down a bit with every new node, but *decreasingly* so with every successive node. We expect to see confirmation times in the sub-second range through tens of thousands of nodes.

However, you need people out there to actually submit 50,000 TPS for there to be that many transactions to even process, and right now there are only about 1,000 transactions per second being submitted (with most of those being votes).

So there is a lot of unused capacity in the Solana network right now.  It will take some time before enough apps and things have been built on Solana for those transaction counts to start creeping up into the tens of thousands.

I don't know anything about DOT.  Does it have a real, functioning, working network right now or is it just another idea waiting to be realized (which for most, never seems to happen)?

I bought 3 bitcoins in 2011.  Should have bought much more but I could see that the transaction rate would never be sufficient to do what people were claiming it would do at the time, which was become a global currency used by end-users everywhere.  So I lost interest.  I sold two of them when they were at $600 apiece, figuring that a 20x return was about the best I could expect.  I still have the last one, which I will hold until it either nets me enough money that I don't need any more, or it becomes worthless.

By the way, in 2011 I was also really concerned with the 'bitcoin founder' holding millions of BTC that he/she/they minted in the first year or two before bitcoin was even public.  I thought, why would I get involved in a currency where one single entity already owns most of it?  Unfortunately I did not realize that most/all of that bitcoin was lost, the private keys probably never even stored but thrown away immediately.  Surely if they were kept someone would have sold some of those bitcoin by now.

My point being, my understanding back then of the early mover advantage - I thought I had already missed the boat on Bitcoin in 2011, not realize that *I* was the early mover - really cost me a lot.  I am hoping not to make that same mistake with Solana.

I just tried to create another new one, it showed up. I cancel it, it was deleted, the usdt went to unsettled status, I settled them, usdt back in the balance. I compared the steps in the # between the two orders and I don't see any differences between them in the steps. In an another one # I see the cancel and later again in an another one the settle funds transaction.

UPDATE: after (like) another hour of searching...

So I started to look step by step through all the single steps with the order creation transaction and checked all the addresses that were used during that creation. While doing this I recognized, the market address raydium for the ray-usdt pair did changed. So I added manually in the url the old one address that was in my order creation # for the market et voil√† suddenly I could see my order! The pair is quoted as RAY/USDT-V2 whatever USDT-V2 now means. So I did all the steps, cancel, settle and all funds now back in my wallet.

Two Possible Scenarios

The first scenario - If the price will continue its unstoppable surge then, it may reach up to $4.5 -$5 in no time after the potential test of the recent resistance that turns into support around 32,500- 33,000sats on a daily chart. From there, we need to see the price to rebound.

The second scenario - If the price will follow the Elliot wave count.

US entities are unable to get SOL rewards for participating in their test net initiatives, like TdS for example (so the recommendation to get started there is useless for me unfortunately).

Many established engineers have their stable job and don't want go into something potentially so volatile. Solana engineers come from Qualcomm, they have a strong and experienced team, this is super important. When you are investigating, the most important thing you are investigating into is the people. The idea can be meh, but if it's a strong, experienced and passionate team, then they will succeed. The next point is Solana idea isn't just meh, it's good, they made a blockchain with very low price per transaction and very high number of transactions per second; basically they made a very fast and cheap blockchain. At present, the speed and transaction price is a problem in the crypto world. Great, but how does it compete with other popular projects in the space, Cardano and Polkadot? Those are solving a very different problem, so we can't even compare, but in terms of speed, they can't compete. But the main point is that Solana has an existing functioning blockchain on which many projects are being built, it's already a product. Cardano is still in the works, it doesn't have a real product yet. This may seem odd since the market cap of Cardano is like ten time larger than Solana. And this leads to the largest problem is the entire crypto space right now, everything is massively over valued and over hyped. So at present, the market cap of a project simply reflects it's hype and nothing about what it's actually doing. How can a project which doesn't deliver any product right now have a marketcap of $38bil...it's pretty wild, basically everyone is just trying to make money off of the hype. 

So should you invest into Solana? Well unfortunately at present the fundamentals of a project do not matter, so the question you need to answer is ""does the Solana team have the ability to hype their project up to some crazy level?""

The reason why any of this matters is that the smallest set of nodes that add up to the liveness threshold for consensus can censor any message in the network.  So the MIN set to get to 1/3 on solana can pick which traders/transfers land on the chain and in what order.  This is true for any network, and the only way to solve this is to maximize that set.

The fact that Solana only proves relative time is no problem for the application I envision. 

Let us say we have the following configuration:

1) Both the device that will be challenged, and the challenging hardware are controlled by the attacker

2) the attacker also controls the local Solana node that is physically close to the device to be challenged. The fact it is part of the Solana network and cannot let bad behavior be detected limits its options, but it still has options.

3) the challenge hardware takes PoH Hash N as input into its challenge query data, and stores the response from the device as a user-generated hash in PoH hash N+1.

I was wondering whether an upper bound on time could be observed and validated by the Solana ledger. In my example above, I am looking for a way for the remote validators to put a cap on Delta T\_max, in [this schematic](https://imgur.com/a/NtRr62e). 

The dashed vertical lines are ""synchronization"" lines (I did not read the white paper in detail yet, so I am just postulating there is such a mechanism), the small red lines are individual PoH hashes, nodes 1 and 2 are ""honest"" nodes, and node 3 runs faster first, to get ahead a little, then gives extra time to the device to compute a counterfeit response to the challenge, and resumes fast hashing to meet the next synchronization deadline.

I am looking for a way where the challenge response validators would only accept the response to the challenge if some conditions, allowing to cap Delta T Max, are met. 

In other words, how could the local Solana node reliably prove to the network that the challenge response was made with a Delta T\_max of less than, say, 1 ¬µs?

The point is to give strong assurance to the network that the external device did not have enough time to forge a counterfeit response before the challenge data became obsolete, and therefore, that it had to use the honest way to answer, as it would be the only way to submit an answer in time.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"It's not 12%.  It was 12% a month ago but has dropped.  I guess people are happy leaving 12% listed on sites like solanabeach.io even though it is incorrect because it looks better and no one is complaining about the misinformation.

If you dig through ACTUAL DATA you will see that the APY is at best around 8.25% right now.  That's if you use a 0% commission validator (there aren't many) that gets the best returns.  TBH my validator (Blade Validator) is about the best return validator out there right now and I'm not too shy to say it.  But the difference between the best and middle of the pack is only about 0.5% APY so we're not talking huge differences here.  Your best bet is to spread stake around to give yourself the greatest security and also to help the network by supporting the most validators.

If you are so inclined, you can research the actual APY using the solana command line client.  You can go to solanabeach.io, find a validator, click on it, and then find its largest stake account.  Then you use the solana command line client to query about that stake account and see its recent returns.  That will tell you the APY being achieved by that validator (the APY is the same for all stake accounts staked to a validator; I always pick the largest just because the numbers are biggest and thus least subject to rounding errors).

For example, using my validator:

At solanabeach.io, I click the menu icon in the upper right and switch to Validators view.

Then in the list I see Blade Validator at spot 45.  I click on that to go to a details page for that validator.  Scrolling down to the Delegators list I see the largest Stake Account at the top of the list and click on it.

Now I am on a Stake Account Details page, and I go to the Address and use the copy icon to copy the address.

Then I go to my terminal and use the solana command line client like so to get details of that stake account:

I can see here every epoch for the past 6 epochs and the APY for each epoch.

It's currently at 8.23%.  It went up from 7.74% because I just set my commission to 0% last epoch, it was 8% previously.  So you can see that the difference in returns from an 8% commission validator and a 0% commission validator is about 0.5% APY.  Not a huge difference, but not insignificant either.

You can do the above with any validator, choosing its largest stake account and then using solana stake-account command to find out what kind of APY that validator has been achieving.  Here are some examples for the most recent epoch:

    Chorus One: 7.40% APY
    Everstake: 8.09% APY
    melea.xyz: 8.17% APY
    Forbole: 7.47% APY
    moonlet.io: 7.79% APY

Everstake and melea.xyz are 0% commission validators which is why they are the best APY in this list.  But they're still not as good as my validator.  Why?  Because my validator has 0% commission AND the best vote performance, and vote performance determines overall payout.",True,,0,1617556021,,1617556499.0,0,gtd3voe,False,t3_mjhyrh,False,t1_gtbjmnn,/r/solana/comments/mjhyrh/how_do_i_stake/gtd3voe/,,,5,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 80, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Everything is better with a good hug', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_8352bdff-3e03-4189-8a08-82501dd8f835', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Hugz', 'penny_donate': 0, 'penny_price': 0, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a23bf7f08b633508dedf457f2704c522b94a04', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f2f16e71d2929e3d7275060af3ad6b851dbfb1', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca487311563425e195699a4d7e4c57a98cbfde8b', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b4eedcffb1c09a826e7837532c52979760f1d2b', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d5ab237eb71a9f02bb3bf9ad5ee43741918d6c', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69997ace3ef4ffc099b81d774c2c8f1530602875', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9519d1999ef9dce5c8a9f59369cb92f52d95319', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f076c6434fb2d2f9075991810fd845c40fa73fc6', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85527145e0c4b754306a30df29e584fd16187636', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8843cdf82c3b741d7af057c14076dcd2621e811', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtd3voe,1628409656.0,False

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"Maybe a misnomer but I think of it being 'centralized' in the sense of it still relying quite heavily on a single group - the Solana Foundation, run by the original founders - to keep it going.  It is not out of beta yet because it still does not support at least one absolutely critical feature - slashing - and without the support of the founders bringing out new software and slowly coaxing the network to life, it would not be self-sustaining (in my opinion).  There is a chance that it's already self-sustaining because enough validators may stick around indefinitely to keep it working, but without slashing and some other features, it is in a very precarious position.

Slashing is what is supposed to keep validators honest.  Right now there is nothing keeping them honest other than ... well ... honesty on the part of the validators.  A validator could violate the rules and nothing bad would happen.

EXCEPT that I think that it's probably likely that the foundation would have some way to manually slash a bad actor via a software release.  This is a way in which it is currently centralized: all of the algorithms and processes that are supposed to be built into Solana to make it secure and complete are not there yet, and everyone is depending on one central entity to bring those things online.  In that sense, it is controlled by that entity and thus centralized in a fashion.

However, once all the features are in place, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be considered a decentralized network.

With the recent launch of native SPL USDT on Solana, the ecosystem is phasing out SPL Wrapped USDT (WUSDT). 

If you are currently providing liquidity/farming RAY-WUSDT, you will need to migrate to a new RAY-USDT pool soon. We are working on a migration tool to make the process as straightforward as possible. 

We're also considering to add a WUSDT-to-USDT converter directly into 'Swap' so everyone can simply select the two assets and swap to convert.

The new RAY-USDT pool will go live in approx 24 hrs. Make sure to cancel any open RAY-WUSDT orders you have on the trading DEX page before that.

If you dig through ACTUAL DATA you will see that the APY is at best around 8.25% right now.  That's if you use a 0% commission validator (there aren't many) that gets the best returns.  TBH my validator (Blade Validator) is about the best return validator out there right now and I'm not too shy to say it.  But the difference between the best and middle of the pack is only about 0.5% APY so we're not talking huge differences here.  Your best bet is to spread stake around to give yourself the greatest security and also to help the network by supporting the most validators.

If you are so inclined, you can research the actual APY using the solana command line client.  You can go to solanabeach.io, find a validator, click on it, and then find its largest stake account.  Then you use the solana command line client to query about that stake account and see its recent returns.  That will tell you the APY being achieved by that validator (the APY is the same for all stake accounts staked to a validator; I always pick the largest just because the numbers are biggest and thus least subject to rounding errors).

For example, using my validator:

At solanabeach.io, I click the menu icon in the upper right and switch to Validators view.

Then in the list I see Blade Validator at spot 45.  I click on that to go to a details page for that validator.  Scrolling down to the Delegators list I see the largest Stake Account at the top of the list and click on it.

Now I am on a Stake Account Details page, and I go to the Address and use the copy icon to copy the address.

Then I go to my terminal and use the solana command line client like so to get details of that stake account:

I can see here every epoch for the past 6 epochs and the APY for each epoch.

It's currently at 8.23%.  It went up from 7.74% because I just set my commission to 0% last epoch, it was 8% previously.  So you can see that the difference in returns from an 8% commission validator and a 0% commission validator is about 0.5% APY.  Not a huge difference, but not insignificant either.

You can do the above with any validator, choosing its largest stake account and then using solana stake-account command to find out what kind of APY that validator has been achieving.  Here are some examples for the most recent epoch:

    Chorus One: 7.40% APY
    Everstake: 8.09% APY
    melea.xyz: 8.17% APY
    Forbole: 7.47% APY
    moonlet.io: 7.79% APY

Everstake and melea.xyz are 0% commission validators which is why they are the best APY in this list.  But they're still not as good as my validator.  Why?  Because my validator has 0% commission AND the best vote performance, and vote performance determines overall payout.",True,,0,1617556021,,1617556499.0,0,gtd3voe,False,t3_mjhyrh,False,t1_gtbjmnn,/r/solana/comments/mjhyrh/how_do_i_stake/gtd3voe/,,,5,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 80, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Everything is better with a good hug', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_8352bdff-3e03-4189-8a08-82501dd8f835', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Hugz', 'penny_donate': 0, 'penny_price': 0, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a23bf7f08b633508dedf457f2704c522b94a04', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f2f16e71d2929e3d7275060af3ad6b851dbfb1', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca487311563425e195699a4d7e4c57a98cbfde8b', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b4eedcffb1c09a826e7837532c52979760f1d2b', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d5ab237eb71a9f02bb3bf9ad5ee43741918d6c', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69997ace3ef4ffc099b81d774c2c8f1530602875', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9519d1999ef9dce5c8a9f59369cb92f52d95319', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f076c6434fb2d2f9075991810fd845c40fa73fc6', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85527145e0c4b754306a30df29e584fd16187636', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8843cdf82c3b741d7af057c14076dcd2621e811', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtd3voe,1628409656.0,False

Cool. I want to ask you about blockchain's space cost: With Bitcoin, in order to occupy space on the blockchain (store transactions), you have to pay a high fee because you only have 1MB every 10 minutes (or a little more if everyone used Segwit) of space available.

Here I am NOT talking about ""deep"" decentralization arguments like ""blockchain has to remain small in order for everyone to download it"" because as long as there are even few thousands of nodes distributed around the globe that can operate I can't see any real threat.

I am talking about the possibility of an eventual attacker to, relatively cheaply, occupy disk space on nodes.

And maybe I didn't get how Solana works at all, but even 50k of legit transactions per second looks a lot to be stored. How much is the average transaction size? (I can't find this info, along with the actual blockchain size too).

a. I discount this one because the code is open source, which is what matters at the end of the day. Documentation is great, but frequently does not match the actual code. Each crypto project is its own bug bounty program for black hat hackers. There is plenty of incentive for them to look for weaknesses in Solana. 

b Can you point to evidence of ""specific endpoints that most users have to go through?""

c Took a quick look at the code base and did not find any reference to slashing, could you point to the placeholder to which you refer?

d This one is a concern for me. Their inflation system is complicated and thus difficult to understand. I am concerned that as a venture capital backed project, they will not be able to resist the temptation to print their own money if / when there's a big market for it.

I think your theory about Bitcoin, when block rewards are gone, is valid for retail users, but if it becomes a settlement system for big institutions then the fee system should work. That said, it does seem like there is probably a more energy efficient way to do this.

Solana's price action has been quite curious the last few days. It seemed to become uncorrelated to the rest of the crypto market on Monday. It makes me wonder if they have hired a promoter to create interest by driving up the price.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"There are efforts currently underway to create what are called ""stake pools"".  These are going to be a network-supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its SOL to validators.  The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right.  It's sort of a second layer of staking, where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security.

I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months.

Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster - 'stake boss' is a thing soon to be released (from what I have read) by Block Logic, the company that does validators.app.  Stake Boss is not a true stake pool - there is no token created to represent membership, it's a much more direct mechanism where you simply re-assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security.  In this case you're basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you, that manager being Stake Boss.  It's similar to what stake pools will be in practice.

Keep in mind that it's not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top; if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing, you may be fine with that.  You're basically paying to have your stake managed, which is a perfectly valid service that you may find worth the cost.

Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools (and possibly Stake Boss, although I don't know Block Logic's exact plans, only they know) will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around.  Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know, some may spread only a little bit, it will be up to how the pool is managed.

So when those come online, there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage.

If you are not in the USA, then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators -- it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the ""Tour de SOL"" whereby they prove the quality of their systems, and once they pass all the hurdles, then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225,000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself.  More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program.  However, this is only available to non-US participants, and it also only happens occasionally, and furthermore, I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators.

I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through ""connections"".  The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL.  Those institutional investors don't even seem to care that much about the quality of validation - the highest stake validator, Chorus One, was down for more than 9 hours last epoch, which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators - and yet Chorus One didn't lose any stake because of it, instead they seem to just be gaining more ...

So to some degree, stake begets more stake, which makes it even harder for those trying to enter.  You are going to have to rely on connections, if you have them, and handouts from the foundation and stake pools, if and when those become available.

Once you have some stake and are in the system, you can then try to attract more, with lower commission, better service, better returns, additional services offered, and ... marketing.  Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists.  This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention.  We'll see ....

p.s. if you are considering running a validator, you may want to consult my spreadsheet of expected Validator returns.  You will have to make a copy of the sheet to be able to edit the values, but it will allow you to play with the numbers, put in what you might expect to achieve ... it calculates expected profit and also calculates what the amount of SOL you'd have to have staked to your validator is in order to break even.

&gt;These protocol-based rewards, to be distributed to participating validation and replication clients, are to be a result of a global supply inflation rate, calculated per Solana epoch and distributed amongst the active validator set. As discussed further below, the per annum inflation rate is based on a pre-determined disinflationary schedule. This provides the network with monetary supply predictability which supports long term economic stability and security.

Just some things to consider:

* People in the project; There are names / faces / reputations that are tied to this project, they are real people, with real credentials, I'm not sure if this means much to you, but to me it means culpability if things do go wrong.
* The project itself; have you actually tried to transact using sol? have a go, download a wallet on your phone / pc and send some between two devices, it's near instant, which is impressive for a token that also handles smart contacts.
* The investments; Obviously a double edged sword, but, initial investors are what helped this token exist in the first place, this also helps with marketing (which some tokens / coins sorely miss)
* Connections; Binance is on board, there is also a connection with Coinbase (see: Staking via Coinbase custody), whether this manifests into something like a listing or not, remains to be seen.
* It's Chad Ethereum

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"There are efforts currently underway to create what are called ""stake pools"".  These are going to be a network-supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its SOL to validators.  The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right.  It's sort of a second layer of staking, where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security.

I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months.

Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster - 'stake boss' is a thing soon to be released (from what I have read) by Block Logic, the company that does validators.app.  Stake Boss is not a true stake pool - there is no token created to represent membership, it's a much more direct mechanism where you simply re-assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security.  In this case you're basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you, that manager being Stake Boss.  It's similar to what stake pools will be in practice.

Keep in mind that it's not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top; if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing, you may be fine with that.  You're basically paying to have your stake managed, which is a perfectly valid service that you may find worth the cost.

Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools (and possibly Stake Boss, although I don't know Block Logic's exact plans, only they know) will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around.  Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know, some may spread only a little bit, it will be up to how the pool is managed.

So when those come online, there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage.

If you are not in the USA, then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators -- it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the ""Tour de SOL"" whereby they prove the quality of their systems, and once they pass all the hurdles, then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225,000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself.  More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program.  However, this is only available to non-US participants, and it also only happens occasionally, and furthermore, I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators.

I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through ""connections"".  The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL.  Those institutional investors don't even seem to care that much about the quality of validation - the highest stake validator, Chorus One, was down for more than 9 hours last epoch, which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators - and yet Chorus One didn't lose any stake because of it, instead they seem to just be gaining more ...

So to some degree, stake begets more stake, which makes it even harder for those trying to enter.  You are going to have to rely on connections, if you have them, and handouts from the foundation and stake pools, if and when those become available.

Once you have some stake and are in the system, you can then try to attract more, with lower commission, better service, better returns, additional services offered, and ... marketing.  Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists.  This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention.  We'll see ....

p.s. if you are considering running a validator, you may want to consult my spreadsheet of expected Validator returns.  You will have to make a copy of the sheet to be able to edit the values, but it will allow you to play with the numbers, put in what you might expect to achieve ... it calculates expected profit and also calculates what the amount of SOL you'd have to have staked to your validator is in order to break even.

I want to ask here to the executives to Solana one question. What has changed with Kin that now made you change your initial deal and declining the grant? 

Kin brings right now  exactly the same at the table when the deal was made. In fact right now it brings even more to the table with a 5x higher market cap and even more signifcant legal clarity.

I see this as the primary reason why block sizes in BTC and ETH are limited. In case of BTC (Lightning network) and ETH (Rollups) they try to create tech to reduce the amount of data that needs to be permanently stored by compressing multiple transactions into single one. The BTC approach I feel is poorly designed and IMO, won‚Äôt scale as it requires a complex network of payment channels that is hard to grow. The ETH rollup approach will help maybe 100-200x I feel. 

However, even with rollups in place, the data eventually outgrows what is feasible to store on a single node. In case of ETH, sharding will split up the data across multiple nodes. In case of Solana, it seems to be already the case that the data is split up across the network (but its not called ‚Äúsharding‚Äù). Solana also seems to have facilities to mark operations as non-mutable, which simplifies implementing a distributed caching system to provide data availability ‚Äì at least if code can be practically written to take advantage of this.

I didn't cover everything in the post above, but the carrot being dangled was the up to 1% of SOL tokens being given the the Kin Foundation.

Several other enticing parts of the migration to Solana were covered in a post I made awhile back.  [Enjoy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KinFoundation/comments/fhgfrd/change_my_mind_solana_is_a_beneficial_step/)

I sincerely do not know and would appreciate any info you have ...

US entities are unable to get SOL rewards for participating in their test net initiatives, like TdS for example (so the recommendation to get started there is useless for me unfortunately). You're able to start up a node on the mainnet, but unless you'd been doing it for a while or had acquired a large amount of SOL, I don't see a realistic way in if you're an individual in the US.

&gt;As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end, possibly very low end, build first and try out a non-voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes.

I thought about this as well and am mulling it over. Not a bad idea at all. If I recall I think you can get on their testnet to get familiar with it.

But because their historical graph only updates when they update the number, this resulted in a supposed ""spike"" in circ supply. The reality is that the graph just represents the changes in what CMC was tracking, not actual change in circ supply.

However, you need people out there to actually submit 50,000 TPS for there to be that many transactions to even process, and right now there are only about 1,000 transactions per second being submitted (with most of those being votes).

So there is a lot of unused capacity in the Solana network right now.  It will take some time before enough apps and things have been built on Solana for those transaction counts to start creeping up into the tens of thousands.

I don't know anything about DOT.  Does it have a real, functioning, working network right now or is it just another idea waiting to be realized (which for most, never seems to happen)?

I bought 3 bitcoins in 2011.  Should have bought much more but I could see that the transaction rate would never be sufficient to do what people were claiming it would do at the time, which was become a global currency used by end-users everywhere.  So I lost interest.  I sold two of them when they were at $600 apiece, figuring that a 20x return was about the best I could expect.  I still have the last one, which I will hold until it either nets me enough money that I don't need any more, or it becomes worthless.

By the way, in 2011 I was also really concerned with the 'bitcoin founder' holding millions of BTC that he/she/they minted in the first year or two before bitcoin was even public.  I thought, why would I get involved in a currency where one single entity already owns most of it?  Unfortunately I did not realize that most/all of that bitcoin was lost, the private keys probably never even stored but thrown away immediately.  Surely if they were kept someone would have sold some of those bitcoin by now.

My point being, my understanding back then of the early mover advantage - I thought I had already missed the boat on Bitcoin in 2011, not realize that *I* was the early mover - really cost me a lot.  I am hoping not to make that same mistake with Solana.

2. Verifiers respond as fast as they can.  this is where the leader can basically pick and choose their favorite verifiers and do some censorship up until 2/3+1 majority requirement.  but, so can every leader, and everyones ""choice"" of censorship is encoded into the chain.  Basically, if you censor someone, expect them to censor you back equally.
3.  right now we have a bare bones gossip protocol that sends random requests, but checkout this issue to optimize convergence, https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/302
4. It's because we can do optimistic concurrency control.  Basically, all the verifiers can optimistically vote assuming that everyone else will vote as well without observing anyone else vote.  When they actually observe the votes later they can trust the PoH data structure without witnessing the votes directly.

False,ZantetsuLastBlade2,,,,"I agree.  The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0% commission, like Everstake.

I also agree that no-commission validation is not sustainable.  These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base.  I don't quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though, given that they've attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere. 

I run a validator and I have 8% commission which I think is pretty close to the average.

Within a given commission range, you can also look at the total number of votes being cast, since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting.  Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible, then the overall take will be as large as possible (but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers).

On validators.app, you can see this in the ""Skipped Vote % (distance from leader)"" metric.  The closer to 0, the better (so -0.40% is better than -1.0%), because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer.

So basically there are two factors: how close to optimally the validator is voting (represented by very small skipped vote %) and what commission the validator is taking.  Of the two, unless the skipped vote % is very high, the commission will make the larger difference.

My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0.25% of the very best (represented by values like -0.24% on validators.app).  But I charge 8% commission.

Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network - it makes it more centralized and reduces its security.  So if you want to do what's best for Solana itself, you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators.  Maybe something like 3/4 of your stake on big low-fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators?

That's what I did when I started.  I picked 6 - two in the top 10, two in the 10 - 30 range, and two in the 30 - 100 range (in total stake ranking).  I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission.

I've already showed you what metrics I used in a valuation: that is supply and a working product for starter. And Solana has no working product or users and supply will increased come Jan 2021, so price will drop by then. Im not assigning a value since it is nothing but an idea at this point.

Go google every secondary offering in any market history and you never see price pump on such announcements.

Tweet thread where CMC committed to making the fix happen: https://twitter.com/zmanian/status/1292642715725832192


You can see on CoinGecko that the circ supply increase was much more gradual. We finally got CMC to commit to timely updates (now in the form of the API endpoint that CoinGecko and¬†explorer.solana.com/supply¬†have used for many months) which we were happy about. But because their historical graph only updates when they update the number, this resulted in a supposed ""spike"" in circ supply.

2. The money raised has went to incredible developments. Its not Kin's fault that they got hit with the lawsuit and had to dig themselves out of the whole. I applaud them for not laying down and fighting back at the SEC.
3. They went to stellar cause stellar could handle more transactions than ETH but guess what, they maxed out that block chain too. Their are people and apps sitting on the sidelines right now ready to join in the ecosystem as soon as it can scale so the move to Solana is the only way to make that happen.

,SolanaGoddess,,,,"I'll caveat this by saying I'm not an expert. I'm a crypto professional who's been following the project, reading the transparency reports, and have close friends who work at trading desks and have been accumulating SOL.

1. The unlock isn't as big as people are making it out to be. Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once. It's still big, but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and, unless they plan to release them all at once, will not enter the circulating supply. People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it's going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is \~10.5x current supply. The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation, which is \~5.3x current supply. It's still a lot, but the FUD is a little over the top.
2. The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year. SOL price has gone as high as $5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active. SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months. Back around April-May, it was trading at a steep 75% discount to spot. Lately it's traded around 5-10% discount, which is pretty normal for any lockup. Basically the weak hands have already been traded out.
3. SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months. FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago. This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures. Right now they're trading at $1.92, with spot at $1.98. Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock?

None of this is investment advice, and I will admit I'm heavily biased as I have accumulated the large, large majority of my portfolio in SOL. But I think over the next few days the market will start to take notice of these facts. TheCryptoDog (with &gt;250k followers) has been tweeting this too: [https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoDog/status/1343675194401910784)

Q2. Road map? We have binance research you can see few of the roadmap there and more to come. Basically Solana is a high-performance, permissionless blockchain that features support for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Have any idea what does means?

Q3. Good you know solana well, you just broke some of your bone on solana from selling your bag on low price. Good job, mobile wallet improvement? Yah sure, its like etherium to eth 2.0..evolving blockchain but same gas fee and poor transaction speed. but solana is better than etherium. Its just like eth come first in the space.

The cryptographic timestamps take real time to generate and are pre-image resistant. Meaning that the output of the latest SHA256 hash, is used to generate the next hash. Essentially forming a sequential hash chain that can't be faked. 

Transactions and votes are then appended within these hashes to mark an instance in time of when they occurred. In a way, this helps us cheat the two general problems by allowing nodes to **optimistically** progress before consensus. 

Then during the consensus process that follows - the system/nodes then checks the validity of these transactions/messages by having nodes on the network vote on the ledger each block (every 400ms) for what they believe to be the accurate version of the ledger based on the data they receive from the network. 

We call our consensus mechanism Tower BFT (you can read more on this here:  [https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79](https://medium.com/solana-labs/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79) ).

So your opaque blockchain on Solana and the founders stated ''we aim to burn the tokens'' is not really worth the electrons its printed with. You will burn those tokens by such and such a date or you will not..you make definitive statements Not weasely syntax leaving ambiguity and outs. Any way SOLANA does not SOLVE KINS LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. It will solve SOLANAS high market price by dragging Solana into the crosshairs of the SEC and providing a litigious future and uncertain outlook for SOL. This will allow all the weakhands to exit gracesfully and leave the bagholders waiting for muh moon launch. If you have made money with SOL be proactive and get out now, you like it so much you can probably buy back later for much much less.  Kin is not going to add value to SOLANA and Solana is not going to add value to KIN. Kin is a POISON PILL that will choke Solana. The SEC will finish the job Kin started.

I've already showed you what metrics I used in a valuation: that is supply and a working product for starter. And Solana has no working product or users and supply will increased come Jan 2021, so price will drop by then. Im not assigning a value since it is nothing but an idea at this point.

Go google every secondary offering in any market history and you never see price pump on such announcements.

If you dig through ACTUAL DATA you will see that the APY is at best around 8.25% right now.  That's if you use a 0% commission validator (there aren't many) that gets the best returns.  TBH my validator (Blade Validator) is about the best return validator out there right now and I'm not too shy to say it.  But the difference between the best and middle of the pack is only about 0.5% APY so we're not talking huge differences here.  Your best bet is to spread stake around to give yourself the greatest security and also to help the network by supporting the most validators.

If you are so inclined, you can research the actual APY using the solana command line client.  You can go to solanabeach.io, find a validator, click on it, and then find its largest stake account.  Then you use the solana command line client to query about that stake account and see its recent returns.  That will tell you the APY being achieved by that validator (the APY is the same for all stake accounts staked to a validator; I always pick the largest just because the numbers are biggest and thus least subject to rounding errors).

For example, using my validator:

At solanabeach.io, I click the menu icon in the upper right and switch to Validators view.

Then in the list I see Blade Validator at spot 45.  I click on that to go to a details page for that validator.  Scrolling down to the Delegators list I see the largest Stake Account at the top of the list and click on it.

Now I am on a Stake Account Details page, and I go to the Address and use the copy icon to copy the address.

Then I go to my terminal and use the solana command line client like so to get details of that stake account:

I can see here every epoch for the past 6 epochs and the APY for each epoch.

It's currently at 8.23%.  It went up from 7.74% because I just set my commission to 0% last epoch, it was 8% previously.  So you can see that the difference in returns from an 8% commission validator and a 0% commission validator is about 0.5% APY.  Not a huge difference, but not insignificant either.

You can do the above with any validator, choosing its largest stake account and then using solana stake-account command to find out what kind of APY that validator has been achieving.  Here are some examples for the most recent epoch:

    Chorus One: 7.40% APY
    Everstake: 8.09% APY
    melea.xyz: 8.17% APY
    Forbole: 7.47% APY
    moonlet.io: 7.79% APY

Everstake and melea.xyz are 0% commission validators which is why they are the best APY in this list.  But they're still not as good as my validator.  Why?  Because my validator has 0% commission AND the best vote performance, and vote performance determines overall payout.",True,,0,1617556021,,1617556499.0,0,gtd3voe,False,t3_mjhyrh,False,t1_gtbjmnn,/r/solana/comments/mjhyrh/how_do_i_stake/gtd3voe/,,,5,False,True,False,solana,t5_hcs2n,public,,,,[],text,1505361335.0,t2_cqgpowc,False,,,{},False,,"[{'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'award_type': 'global', 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'coin_price': 80, 'coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'days_of_premium': 0, 'description': 'Everything is better with a good hug', 'end_date': None, 'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png', 'icon_width': 2048, 'id': 'award_8352bdff-3e03-4189-8a08-82501dd8f835', 'is_enabled': True, 'is_new': False, 'name': 'Hugz', 'penny_donate': 0, 'penny_price': 0, 'resized_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a23bf7f08b633508dedf457f2704c522b94a04', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50f2f16e71d2929e3d7275060af3ad6b851dbfb1', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca487311563425e195699a4d7e4c57a98cbfde8b', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b4eedcffb1c09a826e7837532c52979760f1d2b', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/ks45ij6w05f61_oldHugz.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4d5ab237eb71a9f02bb3bf9ad5ee43741918d6c', 'width': 128}], 'resized_static_icons': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69997ace3ef4ffc099b81d774c2c8f1530602875', 'width': 16}, {'height': 32, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9519d1999ef9dce5c8a9f59369cb92f52d95319', 'width': 32}, {'height': 48, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f076c6434fb2d2f9075991810fd845c40fa73fc6', 'width': 48}, {'height': 64, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85527145e0c4b754306a30df29e584fd16187636', 'width': 64}, {'height': 128, 'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8843cdf82c3b741d7af057c14076dcd2621e811', 'width': 128}], 'start_date': None, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/fpm0r5ryq1361_PolarHugs.png', 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None}]",,False,,1.0,,,,False,[],,,,t1_gtd3voe,1628409656.0,False
