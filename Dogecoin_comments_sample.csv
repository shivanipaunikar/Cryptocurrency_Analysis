Someone questioned whether or not that would make a difference. His answer? Maybe.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:
&gt; what's wrong with a CPU? Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some
Which isn't exactly wrong but you just won't get that many, maybe 10k Doge per day or something while others are pumping out these coins.

To answer your last question about ""solo digging using Doge wallet"", its not worth it to solo dig, and from what I understand the miner in the wallet works.

And what you're saying about the ""average person cannot mine"", it implies that an average person cannot use google or other resources and extract the information he needs to get a miner up and running which would take a ""non average(?)"" person little time to set up.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

Instead you will want to keep bumping it up gradually. When do you stop? When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

Pool mining is the best option, but if you haven't got a graphics card to mine with I'd suggest buying 50000 Doge off ebay or investing in a graphics card. CPU mining for a scrypt coin wont get you anything, honestly. From a pool, you might get, what, a couple of thousand in a day.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

Usually this would be the case. Dogecoin difficulty, however, now equates to other established altcoins. People are jumping on this like crazy; the honeymoon period of 'it's still early...' is over, unfortunately.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

It's set quite low by default as to not significantly heat up your graphics card. DO NOT crank it up to 18.. it will cause your computer to be unstable. Instead you will want to keep bumping it up gradually. When do you stop? When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

Pool mining is the best option, but if you haven't got a graphics card to mine with I'd suggest buying 50000 Doge off ebay or investing in a graphics card. CPU mining for a scrypt coin wont get you anything, honestly. From a pool, you might get, what, a couple of thousand in a day.

Usually this would be the case. Dogecoin difficulty, however, now equates to other established altcoins. People are jumping on this like crazy; the honeymoon period of 'it's still early...' is over, unfortunately.

In the meantime, if you're bored, you could double check the following as a preventative measure.

Nope, you don't need to put anything into the dogecoin wallet, you will not be mining through it. Your rewards and everything will be managed through your scryptpool account and from there you can withdraw to your own wallet or set automatic payouts, what have you.

If you are running the .bat file and the command line window pops up try and see if you can get a glimpse of what the error message is before it disappears. It might say could not find port, or incorrect login info, or something else entirely.

If the port/url is the problem make sure you have the correct url and port in the .bat file, which for doge.scryptpools is:

     cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Everything up to and including the -O should be exactly the same. For the part after the -O that asks for the login info it should be changed but in the correct format

For example if my username to log in to doge.scryptpools.com is **doge** and the miner I want to use is named **shibe** and my password is **suchcoin** then the entire code would be

    cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O doge.shibe:suchcoin


save this as cudaminer.bat in the same folder as cudaminer.exe and then run the BATCH file. If it still throws an error it is some other problem I imagine.

Also before you do this make sure you have a miner set up on your doge.scryptpools account",dogecoin,1,swag,cdyjjk2,0,1386711036,t1_cdyjjk2

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

The reason total bitcoins increased at a linear rate had nothing to do with the amount of miners.  It has to do with difficulty.

The reason total bitcoins increased at a linear rate had nothing to do with the amount of miners.  It has to do with difficulty.

When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

Currently Bitcoin is trading for $900 and has a market capitalization of ~$10.8bil.  There are currently ~4.3 billion dogecoin in circulation and $1/per would require a market cap of $4.3 bil


This may be possible, but since one block is found every 60 seconds 1,440 new blocks of dogecoin are found per day, meaning at the current block reward, 0-1.4bil new dogecoin is mined every day, with an average of 700mil/day.  Since dogecoin doesn't have nearly the same amount of demand as bitcoin, having the same market caps is unlikely.  As demand for crytocurrencies centers on Bitcoin, the price per Bitcoin would probably have to rise dramatically before the price per doge got anywhere near $1 per.

That being said, I think doge has a good chance of rising to $1/1000 sometime within a few months.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:
&gt; what's wrong with a CPU? Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some
Which isn't exactly wrong but you just won't get that many, maybe 10k Doge per day or something while others are pumping out these coins.

To answer your last question about ""solo digging using Doge wallet"", its not worth it to solo dig, and from what I understand the miner in the wallet works.

And what you're saying about the ""average person cannot mine"", it implies that an average person cannot use google or other resources and extract the information he needs to get a miner up and running which would take a ""non average(?)"" person little time to set up.

Currently Bitcoin is trading for $900 and has a market capitalization of ~$10.8bil.  There are currently ~4.3 billion dogecoin in circulation and $1/per would require a market cap of $4.3 bil


This may be possible, but since one block is found every 60 seconds 1,440 new blocks of dogecoin are found per day, meaning at the current block reward, 0-1.4bil new dogecoin is mined every day, with an average of 700mil/day.  Since dogecoin doesn't have nearly the same amount of demand as bitcoin, having the same market caps is unlikely.  As demand for crytocurrencies centers on Bitcoin, the price per Bitcoin would probably have to rise dramatically before the price per doge got anywhere near $1 per.

That being said, I think doge has a good chance of rising to $1/1000 sometime within a few months.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

Dogecoin syncs just fine, there's no issue with downloading the blockchain/ making connections to the network.

I don't have a GPU, I'm just trying to mine with my laptop. That should still work right?

&gt; You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

So, to be clear, does that mean I copy/paste that code in with my info into a notepad file, rename it with the .bat extension, and put it in the folder which contains cudaminer.exe?

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

It's set quite low by default as to not significantly heat up your graphics card. DO NOT crank it up to 18.. it will cause your computer to be unstable. Instead you will want to keep bumping it up gradually. When do you stop? When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

In the meantime, if you're bored, you could double check the following as a preventative measure.

Nope, you don't need to put anything into the dogecoin wallet, you will not be mining through it. Your rewards and everything will be managed through your scryptpool account and from there you can withdraw to your own wallet or set automatic payouts, what have you.

If you are running the .bat file and the command line window pops up try and see if you can get a glimpse of what the error message is before it disappears. It might say could not find port, or incorrect login info, or something else entirely.

If the port/url is the problem make sure you have the correct url and port in the .bat file, which for doge.scryptpools is:

     cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Everything up to and including the -O should be exactly the same. For the part after the -O that asks for the login info it should be changed but in the correct format

For example if my username to log in to doge.scryptpools.com is **doge** and the miner I want to use is named **shibe** and my password is **suchcoin** then the entire code would be

    cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O doge.shibe:suchcoin


save this as cudaminer.bat in the same folder as cudaminer.exe and then run the BATCH file. If it still throws an error it is some other problem I imagine.

    setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100

    cgminer --scrypt [-I 19 --thread-concurrency 21712] &lt;-o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333&gt; -u (pool worker name) -p (pool worker password)

The part in [brackets] needs to be changed to reflect your card, use this to find the best settings for you: https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison

The part in &lt;these fuckers&gt; changes depending on your pool. Find the pool's settings. It'll likely be stratum+tcp://(website address):3333 or :3334 Use what's there

Remove the brackets and &lt;these things&gt; after you've got it copied. 

Once you have that file made, save it, and save it as ""dig_dogecoin.bat"", be sure that you have the menu bar selected at the bottom as ""All files,"" not ""Text files"". Save it in the folder where you unzipped cgminer.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

It's set quite low by default as to not significantly heat up your graphics card. DO NOT crank it up to 18.. it will cause your computer to be unstable. Instead you will want to keep bumping it up gradually. When do you stop? When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

Someone questioned whether or not that would make a difference. His answer? Maybe.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:
&gt; what's wrong with a CPU? Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some
Which isn't exactly wrong but you just won't get that many, maybe 10k Doge per day or something while others are pumping out these coins.

To answer your last question about ""solo digging using Doge wallet"", its not worth it to solo dig, and from what I understand the miner in the wallet works.

And what you're saying about the ""average person cannot mine"", it implies that an average person cannot use google or other resources and extract the information he needs to get a miner up and running which would take a ""non average(?)"" person little time to set up.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:

A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

If you don't set this cgminer will set your intensity to ""dynamic"" which means super-slow to play nice with everything on the system.

In the meantime, if you're bored, you could double check the following as a preventative measure.

Nope, you don't need to put anything into the dogecoin wallet, you will not be mining through it. Your rewards and everything will be managed through your scryptpool account and from there you can withdraw to your own wallet or set automatic payouts, what have you.

If you are running the .bat file and the command line window pops up try and see if you can get a glimpse of what the error message is before it disappears. It might say could not find port, or incorrect login info, or something else entirely.

If the port/url is the problem make sure you have the correct url and port in the .bat file, which for doge.scryptpools is:

     cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Everything up to and including the -O should be exactly the same. For the part after the -O that asks for the login info it should be changed but in the correct format

For example if my username to log in to doge.scryptpools.com is **doge** and the miner I want to use is named **shibe** and my password is **suchcoin** then the entire code would be

    cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O doge.shibe:suchcoin


save this as cudaminer.bat in the same folder as cudaminer.exe and then run the BATCH file. If it still throws an error it is some other problem I imagine.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

It's set quite low by default as to not significantly heat up your graphics card. DO NOT crank it up to 18.. it will cause your computer to be unstable. Instead you will want to keep bumping it up gradually. When do you stop? When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

I don't have a GPU, I'm just trying to mine with my laptop. That should still work right?

&gt; You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

So, to be clear, does that mean I copy/paste that code in with my info into a notepad file, rename it with the .bat extension, and put it in the folder which contains cudaminer.exe?

Someone questioned whether or not that would make a difference. His answer? Maybe.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:
&gt; what's wrong with a CPU? Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some
Which isn't exactly wrong but you just won't get that many, maybe 10k Doge per day or something while others are pumping out these coins.

To answer your last question about ""solo digging using Doge wallet"", its not worth it to solo dig, and from what I understand the miner in the wallet works.

And what you're saying about the ""average person cannot mine"", it implies that an average person cannot use google or other resources and extract the information he needs to get a miner up and running which would take a ""non average(?)"" person little time to set up.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

The reason total bitcoins increased at a linear rate had nothing to do with the amount of miners.  It has to do with difficulty.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

Since dogecoin doesn't have nearly the same amount of demand as bitcoin, having the same market caps is unlikely.  As demand for crytocurrencies centers on Bitcoin, the price per Bitcoin would probably have to rise dramatically before the price per doge got anywhere near $1 per.

That being said, I think doge has a good chance of rising to $1/1000 sometime within a few months.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

If you don't set this cgminer will set your intensity to ""dynamic"" which means super-slow to play nice with everything on the system. If you're serious about mining Dogecoins (and why on ~~Earth~~ `the moon` wouldn't you be?) you'll want to send everything else on your computer's performance to hell so you can get dat mad dank kilohash.

Also, whenever you change settings at runtime, it's a good idea to write a config. [S]ettings -&gt; [W]rite config file -&gt; saving to the default location will make it so ""cgminer"" will resume your current setup with no command line options.

Once you have a config, I suggest checking the [official cgminer SCRYPT readme](https://raw.github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/v3.7.2/SCRYPT-README) for settings you can change to fine-tweak your workload (doubled my hashrate for no cost).",dogecoin,2,prog,ce286z1,0,False,t1_ce286z1

2.) no. dogecoin digging gets a random reward based on the difficulty. the specific amount of coins is listed in the original forum thread iirc.

3) both. when difficulty increases, the value that the hash is converted into has to be lower, so it takes longer for a computer to find it. the difficulty increases as the global mining rate rises, to keep the amount of blocks per hour fairly consistent. the number of *dogecoins* decreases, once again seen in the forum thread.",dogecoin,1,,ce1xc6j,0,False,t1_ce1xc6j

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

Pool mining is the best option, but if you haven't got a graphics card to mine with I'd suggest buying 50000 Doge off ebay or investing in a graphics card. CPU mining for a scrypt coin wont get you anything, honestly. From a pool, you might get, what, a couple of thousand in a day.

Usually this would be the case. Dogecoin difficulty, however, now equates to other established altcoins. People are jumping on this like crazy; the honeymoon period of 'it's still early...' is over, unfortunately.

When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

In the meantime, if you're bored, you could double check the following as a preventative measure.

Nope, you don't need to put anything into the dogecoin wallet, you will not be mining through it. Your rewards and everything will be managed through your scryptpool account and from there you can withdraw to your own wallet or set automatic payouts, what have you.

If you are running the .bat file and the command line window pops up try and see if you can get a glimpse of what the error message is before it disappears. It might say could not find port, or incorrect login info, or something else entirely.

If the port/url is the problem make sure you have the correct url and port in the .bat file, which for doge.scryptpools is:

     cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Everything up to and including the -O should be exactly the same. For the part after the -O that asks for the login info it should be changed but in the correct format

For example if my username to log in to doge.scryptpools.com is **doge** and the miner I want to use is named **shibe** and my password is **suchcoin** then the entire code would be

    cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O doge.shibe:suchcoin


save this as cudaminer.bat in the same folder as cudaminer.exe and then run the BATCH file. If it still throws an error it is some other problem I imagine.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

Let the games begin !

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

Currently Bitcoin is trading for $900 and has a market capitalization of ~$10.8bil.  There are currently ~4.3 billion dogecoin in circulation and $1/per would require a market cap of $4.3 bil


This may be possible, but since one block is found every 60 seconds 1,440 new blocks of dogecoin are found per day, meaning at the current block reward, 0-1.4bil new dogecoin is mined every day, with an average of 700mil/day.  Since dogecoin doesn't have nearly the same amount of demand as bitcoin, having the same market caps is unlikely.  As demand for crytocurrencies centers on Bitcoin, the price per Bitcoin would probably have to rise dramatically before the price per doge got anywhere near $1 per.

That being said, I think doge has a good chance of rising to $1/1000 sometime within a few months.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

The reason total bitcoins increased at a linear rate had nothing to do with the amount of miners.  It has to do with difficulty.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

Let the games begin !

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

Someone questioned whether or not that would make a difference. His answer? Maybe.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:
&gt; what's wrong with a CPU? Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some
Which isn't exactly wrong but you just won't get that many, maybe 10k Doge per day or something while others are pumping out these coins.

To answer your last question about ""solo digging using Doge wallet"", its not worth it to solo dig, and from what I understand the miner in the wallet works.

Pool mining is the best option, but if you haven't got a graphics card to mine with I'd suggest buying 50000 Doge off ebay or investing in a graphics card. CPU mining for a scrypt coin wont get you anything, honestly. From a pool, you might get, what, a couple of thousand in a day.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

In the meantime, if you're bored, you could double check the following as a preventative measure.

Nope, you don't need to put anything into the dogecoin wallet, you will not be mining through it. Your rewards and everything will be managed through your scryptpool account and from there you can withdraw to your own wallet or set automatic payouts, what have you.

If you are running the .bat file and the command line window pops up try and see if you can get a glimpse of what the error message is before it disappears. It might say could not find port, or incorrect login info, or something else entirely.

If the port/url is the problem make sure you have the correct url and port in the .bat file, which for doge.scryptpools is:

     cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Everything up to and including the -O should be exactly the same. For the part after the -O that asks for the login info it should be changed but in the correct format

For example if my username to log in to doge.scryptpools.com is **doge** and the miner I want to use is named **shibe** and my password is **suchcoin** then the entire code would be

    cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O doge.shibe:suchcoin


save this as cudaminer.bat in the same folder as cudaminer.exe and then run the BATCH file. If it still throws an error it is some other problem I imagine.

Also before you do this make sure you have a miner set up on your doge.scryptpools account",dogecoin,1,swag,cdyjjk2,0,1386711036,t1_cdyjjk2

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

Dogecoin syncs just fine, there's no issue with downloading the blockchain/ making connections to the network. 

&gt; I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used this guide.

I don't have a GPU, I'm just trying to mine with my laptop. That should still work right?

&gt; You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

So, to be clear, does that mean I copy/paste that code in with my info into a notepad file, rename it with the .bat extension, and put it in the folder which contains cudaminer.exe?

&gt; Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

No bro, this is exactly what I need. I too have little coding experience lol.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins.

Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

Currently Bitcoin is trading for $900 and has a market capitalization of ~$10.8bil.  There are currently ~4.3 billion dogecoin in circulation and $1/per would require a market cap of $4.3 bil


This may be possible, but since one block is found every 60 seconds 1,440 new blocks of dogecoin are found per day, meaning at the current block reward, 0-1.4bil new dogecoin is mined every day, with an average of 700mil/day.  Since dogecoin doesn't have nearly the same amount of demand as bitcoin, having the same market caps is unlikely.  As demand for crytocurrencies centers on Bitcoin, the price per Bitcoin would probably have to rise dramatically before the price per doge got anywhere near $1 per.

That being said, I think doge has a good chance of rising to $1/1000 sometime within a few months.

Instead you will want to keep bumping it up gradually. When do you stop? When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

Pool mining is the best option, but if you haven't got a graphics card to mine with I'd suggest buying 50000 Doge off ebay or investing in a graphics card. CPU mining for a scrypt coin wont get you anything, honestly. From a pool, you might get, what, a couple of thousand in a day.

&gt;Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some

Usually this would be the case. Dogecoin difficulty, however, now equates to other established altcoins. People are jumping on this like crazy; the honeymoon period of 'it's still early...' is over, unfortunately.

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

Currently Bitcoin is trading for $900 and has a market capitalization of ~$10.8bil.  There are currently ~4.3 billion dogecoin in circulation and $1/per would require a market cap of $4.3 bil


This may be possible, but since one block is found every 60 seconds 1,440 new blocks of dogecoin are found per day, meaning at the current block reward, 0-1.4bil new dogecoin is mined every day, with an average of 700mil/day.  Since dogecoin doesn't have nearly the same amount of demand as bitcoin, having the same market caps is unlikely.  As demand for crytocurrencies centers on Bitcoin, the price per Bitcoin would probably have to rise dramatically before the price per doge got anywhere near $1 per.

That being said, I think doge has a good chance of rising to $1/1000 sometime within a few months.

Dogecoins are my first experience with cryptocoins.. but i imagine having an online wallet is faster (and thus more liquid). And perhaps the offline wallet also has the risk of all your doge disappearing if you lose it.

That said, questions I wonder if people could answer to me
A) is it safe to back up my offline wallet to say, skydrive or dropbox?

You choose 4 numbers. For example : 1234

If you hit all , you take 50 % of the total value of bets . If you hit 3 , half of the remaining 50% . If you hit 2 , a third of 50 % . The winner with the highest number has priority .
If there is a winner with 3:01 to 2 is first taken out of the winner with 3 digits and then removed 1/3 of what is left for the winner with 2 digits .

The award is divided by all winners .

It booked 50 % of bets for acertador 4 numbers and if there is no winner , accumulates for the next draw . The other half also accumulates. If there is a winner with any 3 numbers and 2 , the value is left will accumulate for another draw too.

The draw is held every day at 22h with live stream (if there was enough punters ) . Will be posted in this thread link .

The minimum bet is 100 Dogecoins and can be wagered until 21pm.

I will take 5 to 10 % of bet me. This will depend on the total value of bets , so that the winners can earn more coins .

Post to thread the stake and its license number .

I'll post before each draw , the total value of bets and how much I cashed .

The winner will receive the prize as soon as the draw is made .

Let the games begin !

If you are still having problems syncing dogecoin-qt, make sure you are properly saving dogecoin.conf as a CONF file and not a dogecoin.conf.text file, and that it contains the exact same code that is given. Pool mining doesn't require you to alter this file any. Restart dogecoin-qt and wait patiently while it makes a connection and syncs all the blocks.

I wanted to mine with my nvidia gpu so I used [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1sget2/guide_how_to_solo_mine_with_nvidia_gpu/) guide. I couldn't start it within the dogecoin-qt gui, it required me to start it on its own.

You don't have to place the cudaminer in the same folder as dogecoin-qt but inside whatever folder your cudaminer.exe is in you have to make a batch file (cudaminer.bat) with the following code:

 &gt;cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Make sure you put in whatever your login is for the pool site then a period then your miner's name and then a colon and then the miner password.

Finally after saving as .bat, run the cudaminer.bat file you just made and it should work.

Sorry if that was too painfully dumbed down but I have little to no coding expertise so I pretty much made every mistake possible figuring it out.

The reason total bitcoins increased at a linear rate had nothing to do with the amount of miners.  It has to do with difficulty.

In the meantime, if you're bored, you could double check the following as a preventative measure.

Nope, you don't need to put anything into the dogecoin wallet, you will not be mining through it. Your rewards and everything will be managed through your scryptpool account and from there you can withdraw to your own wallet or set automatic payouts, what have you.

If you are running the .bat file and the command line window pops up try and see if you can get a glimpse of what the error message is before it disappears. It might say could not find port, or incorrect login info, or something else entirely.

If the port/url is the problem make sure you have the correct url and port in the .bat file, which for doge.scryptpools is:

     cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O pool_login_name.miner_name:minerpassword

Everything up to and including the -O should be exactly the same. For the part after the -O that asks for the login info it should be changed but in the correct format

For example if my username to log in to doge.scryptpools.com is **doge** and the miner I want to use is named **shibe** and my password is **suchcoin** then the entire code would be

    cudaminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://doge.scryptpools.com:3333 -O doge.shibe:suchcoin


save this as cudaminer.bat in the same folder as cudaminer.exe and then run the BATCH file. If it still throws an error it is some other problem I imagine.

Someone questioned whether or not that would make a difference. His answer? Maybe.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:
&gt; what's wrong with a CPU? Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some
Which isn't exactly wrong but you just won't get that many, maybe 10k Doge per day or something while others are pumping out these coins.

To answer your last question about ""solo digging using Doge wallet"", its not worth it to solo dig, and from what I understand the miner in the wallet works.

And what you're saying about the ""average person cannot mine"", it implies that an average person cannot use google or other resources and extract the information he needs to get a miner up and running which would take a ""non average(?)"" person little time to set up.

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

It's set quite low by default as to not significantly heat up your graphics card. DO NOT crank it up to 18.. it will cause your computer to be unstable. Instead you will want to keep bumping it up gradually. When do you stop? When you start seeing the HW number go above 0 or when your computer starts getting really warm.. that will depend on your hardware and the asteroid support forums will probably give you better guidance than I can for your particular machine.

So you are mining these coins.. but they aren't going you you.. they are are being stored in the doge coin wallet of whoever runs the pool server you went with. You will need to download the dogecoin-qt wallet app for mac:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=361813.0

It will take a while for it to first start because it has to download and process the entire doge coin transaction history. Afterwards you will be good to go to receive your doge coins. To receive your doges from the pool, create a new receive address and then submit that in your account info on the pool site. Once you get a few doges you can either manually cash out or you could can setup the pool to auto payout every time you make X amount of doges.

For all of this make sure you remember your passwords and don't lose your wallet (the thing the dogecoin-qt app helps setup) Just like if you lost your actual wallet everything you worked for will be gone ;.;",dogecoin,1,technicianshibe,ce20tp6,0,False,t1_ce20tp6

I am going to take the example of bitcoin, but it is similar for the other crypto coins.
A ""miner"" in our case will be a GPU ( video card ). When you put a miner on the network, it starts calculating MHs. As an example, an AMD 7850, will output around 270 MHs ( Mega hash / seconds ). There is nothing to do on your side beside the initial setup. Once it starts mining, forget about it, it will keep on going 24/7.
THose MHs of calculation allow the miner to resolve "" share of works "". Those shares are the encoded part of the network , where the transactions are hidden. Most of the time, 99.99999 %, a share is useless. That is defined by the current "" difficulty "". The difficulty changes overtime, adapts itself to the number of miners on the network. The more miners, the harder it is to find an hidden transaction in a share. But... sometimes... your miner find a "" block "" of transaction, in a share. When it does, it generates 25 Bitcoins. They directly end up in your wallet.
In order for your wallet to really have those 25 bitcoins, this "" new block of transaction found "" has to be validated by the network ( other miners ).
The main issue is : the difficulty. ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty ).
Because of numbers of miners on the network actually, it is nearly impossible for a "" solo "" miner to find a block. Remember that your miner is competing with the other miners on the network to be the first to find the block. To overcome that, people choose to mine in "" pool "".
A pool is directed by a server who sends the "" Share of work "" to miners. When one block is found, the 25 BTC are dispatched between all the miners of the pool, proportional to the number of shares of work they solved in the current "" block round"". A pool that "" nuubies "" use is : "" Coinotron.com. The big ones : deepbit.net, ozcoin.net.

The reason total bitcoins increased at a linear rate had nothing to do with the amount of miners.  It has to do with difficulty.  The difficulty is recalculated every two weeks such that one block is produced on average every 10 minutes.  Thus, if you add more hashing power, difficulty scales and the same amount of bitcoins are mined.

If you're doing pooled mining I'd get cudaminer if you have an nVidia graphics card and cgminer if you have an ATI card. I fiddled with it for a long time and could never get the pooled mining on DogecoinQT to work.

Then to call it I made a minedogecoin.bat file and inside it I put the line

&gt;
cgminer.exe --scrypt  -o stratum+tcp://doge.cryptopool.it:3322 -u foxfaction.worker1 -p pass1

foxfaction being my username at the doge.cryptopool.it website, and worker1 being my worker name, and pass1 being that worker password. The syntax to call cudaminer is very similar


Of course if you just want to do solo mining, then none of this applies and you can use that QT program and select ""mine solo"", but your odds of actually solving a block and getting all the dogecoins for it are about 1 in 100,000 or so if you ran it for a whole day and had a good computer.

Someone questioned whether or not that would make a difference. His answer? Maybe.

You call him out on this being a dumb answer when in fact, maybe it does make a difference, just not to you. No having your username shorter does not increase your hashes per second but having a long one makes you mess it up when you try and edit it and what not. 

Also the person tells you that you are mining on a CPU and its going to be slow. You reply with:
&gt; what's wrong with a CPU? Dogecoin just started I mean it seems like I could get at least some
Which isn't exactly wrong but you just won't get that many, maybe 10k Doge per day or something while others are pumping out these coins.

To answer your last question about ""solo digging using Doge wallet"", its not worth it to solo dig, and from what I understand the miner in the wallet works.

And what you're saying about the ""average person cannot mine"", it implies that an average person cannot use google or other resources and extract the information he needs to get a miner up and running which would take a ""non average(?)"" person little time to set up.
