The strength with which the connection is made is different. If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

&gt; so her boyfriend would need to be adept enough to manually unpack and deserialise the address, repack it into an address without a payment ID, and then the train company needs to have published their address somewhere at some stage (unlikely if they only start using Monero from when stealth payment IDs are complete).

But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

Well, you know, seriousness. As in thinking about the best way to get things done, and putting in the effort to do them in the best way. The extra effort of maintaining a nym is active evidence of willingness to do that.

It's even evidence of willingness to give up ""geek fame"" in favor of more important things.

Can you substantiate that in any way, or is it just how you feel? Can you even explain what ""responsible"" means in that context?

Anybody, anonymous or not, can ditch any project, and especially a project like Monero, with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever. At most you might want to explain your reasons. Being a contributor to an open source project is not normally considered to indenture you to that project.

If somebody put in the effort to learn the code, and made real contributions, why would you think you had some right to expect that person to stick with the project when ""real life"" required otherwise? It's not even disreputable to quit a real JOB under those circumstances. It does not reflect on your good name to do so, unless you've made some kind of promise, which basically never happens.

Monero's value will come from usefulness (utility), not from overall scarcity and some numbers fudged on a spreadsheet. When it has utility there will be a natural and gradual price increase, as demand will slightly outstrip supply due to ever-increasing utility (a Monero network effect).

But all of this will take time - maybe even several years to play out.

Like any new technology, I understand the first of any kind is likely an alpha test. A new concept will go through all of the rigorous tests that society can throw at it, from practicality, ease of use, exploitability, manipulation, spoofing/knock-off and general acceptance. Being that Bitcoin is a ‘currency’ and also acts as a ‘stock’, I figured that it was subject to the whims of the global market, making it even more susceptible to long-term failure or obsolescence. From early implementation, I was concerned that large investors or organizations with access to large computing infrastructure would corner the market or ramp up the difficulty. I watched small investors purchase GPU mining equipment, invest in ASICS and then cloud mining until the difficulty was hardly worth the effort. We then saw companies go bankrupt, investors lose their money and scammers cash out. When Litecoin and Altcoins in general started to appear, I believed the second phase of Bitcoin was starting and eventually markets would start shifting towards other coins that were still small-scale minable. I still didn’t see any noticeable traits that made Altcoins stand apart from Bitcoins, they were just clones with minor changes to the mining process, but overall they were all macro-minable. The same problem was still apparent; centralization was still possible. I have been waiting for a solid ASIC-hard coin, with privacy features and a non-Meme-Joke/immature image to invest in. I personally believe that decentralization, privacy, ease-of-use, professional brand and a dedicated DevTeam are the key features needed for a long-term successful coin. Most of the other coins with these traits were all deemed as scam-coins or were pre-mined. I have been waiting for a CPU coin that has all of the previously mentioned features without the flaws and that is actively working towards making it easier for the commoner to participate in the market. So far, Monero is number 1 on my list with all of these traits and current promises of continued development for the traits I believe that will make a coin successful in the long-term. While most Bitcoin investors believe that as difficulty becomes out of reach for most people, the price will go up; I personally believe that people will start pulling their money from Bitcoin and investing in something that continues to create currency over a long-term. Scarcity alone doesn’t create demand. Activity and perceived value creates demand. Scarcity is only valued when alternative options are not present. Cryptocurrency clearly will always have more options, therefore believing that scarcity will perpetually drive up demand is a joke. The only reason it’s still dominant is because of it’s level of acceptance. When another coin can achieve the same acceptance, Bitcoin will have nothing left working for it other than it’s PR tenure, which is also due to expire when a better solution arises. 

tl;dr Monero didn’t find me, I found Monero. True decentralization is the key to successful long-term open source currency.

For instance, if a miner could purchase equipment upgrades in XMR, pay his electricity in XMR, and pay his rent in XMR, that's his costs covered. Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system. With fiat and BTC settlement bridges (ie. that have eventual settlement, not instant settlement) this can happen without the parties even knowing or caring what happens, and it can happen without affecting the price much - or at all.

Ultimately the aim is to create something useful and usable that is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. That is not to dissuade speculators entirely, but they will have to get in at the sub-$50 mark if they want to see speculative growth.

If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

As I mentioned in my reply to Hizonner just now, that's ONLY true if addresses are one-time or secret. Reusable addresses are actually a protection, because if Edward Snowden's address is public knowledge then your knowing it or having it on your phone cannot be an offence (not without LEA or whoever grossly overplaying their hand).

&gt; But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

It is just obfuscation, in a sense, but it's also not *that* weak, because an exchange (for instance) will then have a different ""address"" for each person, so it's very unlikely they'll ever publish their address without a payment ID.

To illustrate at a very basic, unstealthed level: let's say my address is ABC. Let's say Poloniex's address is DEF. Poloniex will no longer tell me to ""make a payment to DEF using payment ID 714"", they'll say ""make a payment to DEF714"". Your deposit address on Poloniex will be DEF837. Bob's address will be DEF419. Even if you are proficient and you can unpack the address to ""DEF"" searching for it won't reveal anything because Poloniex will never have publicly listed just that address for payment.

Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

&gt; At least in my case, I'm not asking to force everybody to use single-purpose addresses. I just would like an easier way of producing them that doesn't force me to incur extra fees or write my own wallet.

For some reason there are a handful of morons (I can't think of a more PC term for them) who insist on not reading dga's blog post all the way through, and make massive leaps in logic like the German gentleman in question. To quote [dga in a response to such a moron on Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.msg8578519#msg8578519):

&gt; Reading comprehension is hard for sockpuppets.  Something in the sock material seems to cloud their eyes.

&gt; To others reading the thread, while I'd of course encourage you to actually read what I wrote.

&gt; tl;dr:  Bytecoin was a scam, they crippled the miner, Monero inherited it when Monero was still ""bitmonero"", and it took a while before the Monero devs got the code fast by undoing the crap that Bytecoin had added.  During that time, I made some money.  After that time, I didn't.  That time has been over for a long time.

&gt; To their credit, the Monero devs have always been up-front that there's a lot of work to be done with respect to auditing, both in cryptography and design, and in implementation, and they've made credible progress at doing so.  One hopes that any baggage from the cryptonote/bytecoin fork has been priced in and is well understood by the community, given that the coin's been around for months and the developers have been very up front about these things and their plans for addressing those risks.

There is also precedent for this - Bitcoin had a network fork occur when they moved from BerkeleyDB to LevelDB due to BerkeleyDB unexpectedly being buggy and rejecting a block that was actually valid. I do not suspect we are likely to have a similar occurrence, but that incident is obviously on our minds.

To get to the meat of your question: of course this affects how miners relay transactions - received transactions and blocks require database access to be verified (eg. verify there are no key image violations), and thus have to be processed single-threaded in order. If the database version ends up dead-locking because of a rush of transactions / blocks *then new transactions / blocks can't be verified* and thus won't be relayed. When the deadlock is resolved mining nodes could find themselves secluded from the rest of the network, collectively mining a dead chain. Meanwhile in-RAM nodes will have just kept on chugging away, and if there is sufficient disparity between the two groups we will have an ugly fork that may take many hours to resolve (if at all).",,5,xmr,t1_cru0aoz,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, if a miner could purchase equipment upgrades in XMR, pay his electricity in XMR, and pay his rent in XMR, that's his costs covered. Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system. With fiat and BTC settlement bridges (ie. that have eventual settlement, not instant settlement) this can happen without the parties even knowing or caring what happens, and it can happen without affecting the price much - or at all.

Ultimately the aim is to create something useful and usable that is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. That is not to dissuade speculators entirely, but they will have to get in at the sub-$50 mark if they want to see speculative growth. That said, I'm not sure the sharp rises and crashes have been good for Bitcoin, and I'd much prefer Monero to reach some realistic level (say $100) and hover around there.

I will try to use our time productively by sharing some educational information that could hopefully trump this boring elevator music:

Governments are printing paper money like confetti and in the process they are diluting our purchasing power of our savings with inflation.  In the process the bankers are getting richer and governments are misappropriating taxpayer money whilst the poor have to bear the financial tax burden of bailouts of the financial system for the horrible behaviour of the corruptible politicians.  Everyone can associate with the induced business cycles by the Federal Reserve System.  I am sure you are most familiar with what happened in 2008 during the world-wide recession, Cyprus bank bail ins and numerous other examples.

With the invention of Bitcoin the power of money creation is systematically eroded from governments.   The cryptographically protected decentralised ledger of Bitcoin is a revolutionary breakthrough because it converts money into an incorruptible protocol, the use of which is totally voluntary in contrast with the fiat money that is issued by governments that’s  use is violently being enforced via legal tender laws and gangs with guns i.e. police and military.

Bitcoin is undeniably a great achievement in generating a worldwide decentralised consensus ledger in a frictionless way, which forms a very sounds basis for a monetary platform.  However, the traceability of transactions through the Bitcoin ledger undermines financial privacy that in the current digital age of Orwellian government surveillance is undermining human liberty.  Financial privacy is as much a human right as any other and needs protection, hence the invention of Monero.

Monero’s cryptographic protocol achieves what Bitcoin was intended to but couldn’t because of fundamental cryptographic limitations.  In the long run the anonymous Monero protocol could mean more for financial freedom and liberty than Bitcoin.  Whilst Bitcoin could end the reliance on a parasitic Federal Reserve System, Monero could also end government and third party spying on your everyday financial transactions.

So, my hope is that you would feel intrigued and inquisitive in Googling the revolution that is Monero for yourself.  See you on the online forums.  Google will lead you there.

Have a great day and I hope this elevator trip will be most memorable.  
Adios!

* There is a new website: http://www.getmonero.org 
     This features updated design
     There are sections for missives, a blog, the forum, and a work in progress knowledgebase
     There is a new design and research goals plan with a graphical map:  http://getmonero.org/design-goals/
     The website is open and stored in the git repository and the devs are welcoming community contribution

* There is a new research paper at  http://lab.monero.cc
     MRL4 - http://lab.monero.cc/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf
     The idea is they are researching anonymity vs mixin levels and how this can be improved.  This is a furtherization of MRL 001
     They talked about unlinkability and untraceability ... two different things.
     They talked about disallowing a 0 mixin transaction except under special circumstances.

* Age based associations (temporal associations):  There is also new understanding that it is possible to determine the age of coins moved in some circumstances.  The info is based on the way inputs are chosen.   This problem is less important than the MRL 004 problem, and very simple.  The risk is basically Panic when early coins are detected as being moved.

*  Towards the end of the talk they highlight the design and development goals I mention above ^^^  http://getmonero.org/design-goals/

* They discuss how important it is to have libraries finished for 3rd party implementations for things like iOs/Android etc so not only can the wallet be coded well, but others can develop apps etc via these tools.

* They defend the slow development pace (&lt;-that is semi editorial) by saying they are still carefully laying groundwork for an enterprise grade product as opposed to trying to just make things like wallets. For example the library development as opposed to a WALLET NOW.",,2,,t1_couhndi,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

In this particular instance the benefits far outweigh the risks, especially as the information is not so sensitive that we have to worry about CloudFlare's interception (Paymium, on the other hand, have a very different threat model).

&gt; TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

I fully agree - but it *does* protect our users from being sniffed at a coffee shop, at their place of work, and even by most state-level actors.

&gt; I'm honestly struggling to use Monero. There's no PPA, no deb package, nothing.

I know, and those are extremely low on our list of priorities right now.

&gt; Really, I don't like being that asshole who just complains without doing anything, but if you care to get more people on board, you should consider usability!

We don't have the resources or the time to do everything. We're just unpaid volunteers, slowly pecking away at this. Complaining won't, unfortunately, bring in more unpaid volunteers, so we are stuck at a bit of a stalemate. My honest suggestion to people like yourself who need ""more"" is to either do it yourself, or to come back in a couple of years when we've had opportunity to iron things out.",,1,xmr,t1_crnt6o0,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Either download the OS X binaries from the link there, or follow the instructions for getting the source from github and building yourself. There should be two executable files that you run from Terminal, bitmonerod and simplewallet.

3. from Terminal, run bitmonerod, and wait until the blockchain is sync'd. This will take hours from scratch, or you can download an intermediate one (linux version, not windows)

4. create a new wallet in Terminal using simpleminer: ./simpleminer --generate-new-wallet=YOURWALLETNAME.bin. Close simpleminer using the command 'exit', and then reopen your wallet with the command ./simpleminer --wallet-file=YOURWALLETNAME.bin. This insures that you know your password. Make a copy of the three YOURWALLETNAME files that you created as a backup.

5. Transfer MRO from exchange to your wallet. YOURWALLETNAME.bin.address.txt contains your public key that the exchange needs (or you can type 'address' in simplewallet). Once transferred, refresh your wallet ('refresh' from within simplewallet), and you should see your coins.

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing. To make matters worse, we spent the first 6 months with completely mixed objectives, whilst still coming to grips with cryptography and a codebase we were unfamiliar with, whilst still patching a never-ending list of rapidly emerging issues, whilst getting to know *each other* as members of the core team, whilst still having to work to make a living.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets. So we start researching a bloom-filter style viewkey lookup, then we get hammered on ""breaking exploits"" from BCX. So we start figuring out what the exploit could-possibly-maybe-not-sure-who-knows-be, then we actually do get attacked. So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero  
https://github.com/tippero/tippero  
https://github.com/roosmaa/go-monero  
https://github.com/netmonk/moneronjs  
https://github.com/TheKoziTwo/xmr-integration

https://github.com/openalias/openalias-api  
https://github.com/Jojatekok/MoneroGui.Net  
https://github.com/jwinterm/lightWallet

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

&gt; Can you substantiate that in any way, or is it just how you feel? Can you even explain what ""responsible"" means in that context?

Well all of us are fallible. Excluding ""perfect"" coders which might be all Monero has, Monero might have fallible coders. Possibly a **bit** ""lazy"" too. There's nothing wrong with that.

Single POW means all the miners mine one algorithm that feeds the blockchain.

Multi POW means every miner can choose between one of several algorithms he wants to mine on. For example Asic owners can mine SHA, GPU miners can mine Scrypt or Skein, people with high electricity costs can mine an algorithm like Groestl or Qubit which effectively uses up to 50% less power.

It also increases the security of the network. Where single POW coins are vulnerable to 51% takeovers, an attacker on the Myriad chain would need 81% of any single algorithm, or 20% or at least 3 algorithms combined.

But you haven't spun one that's feasible yet. I'm not trying to be antagonistic, so hear me out:)

My address is public and known, I posted it above. I use it as my withdrawal address on Monero exchanges, on ShapeShift.io, and (presumably) on some future eBay-like market when I sell my Star Wars Episode I Stap and Battledroid teaser toy. All of those entities can be subpoenaed and they can reveal all of my ""earnings"".

*But that's all that an attacker can gleam* -

&gt; Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming and outgoing transactions

This is where you're misunderstanding. The viewkey reveals my incoming transactions, but NOT my outgoing transactions. So *at best* an attacker can determine the source of some of my income, but that's where it ends.

The viewkey isn't a magic key that reveals all transactions, it's a magic key that reveals all outputs you control. Right now those outputs can be spent at mixin 0, which would reveal that the output is spent/unspent, but once [MRL-0004](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf) has been implemented that will no longer be the case.

So with this information let's go back to your example:

&gt; If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

&gt; ... and that means Alice is exposed by Bob's approach to single-purpose wallets.

In order to know that Alice has been paying Bob they'd have to ask Alice, not Bob. There's no way for Bob to prove where the funds he received came from, he can only prove that he has control over them. Only Alice can prove ownership of the transactions she initiated.

So Alice is exposed because LEA asked her for her data and she complied.

Similarly, if LEA instead approach Bob, they can see ""Bob has received a string of payments"", but not who the payments are from.

Obviously LEA can beat the information out of both Bob and Alice, but Monero is not a solution to [rubber-hose cryptanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis).

&gt; By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues.

Monero is far from mature, so taken in its current state this is an unsolvable problem: if an advertiser/insurer/enemy knows your email address they can go and offer Poloniex a bucket load of money for your data, and come up with some idea of your personal Monero holdings. But when Monero is mature there will be too many moving targets for that, and knowing your ""net worth"" isn't worth the expenditure.

A proper post mortem of the attack is what [MRL-0002, ""Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing the CryptoNote Protocol""](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0002.pdf), is all about, and is a worthy read.

The long and the short of it is: the tree-hash.c code that is responsible for transaction hashes within a block had a bug in it whereby any hashes for more than 512 transactions would be computed using uninitialised memory (ie. with garbage). So the attacker slowly built up the dynamic block size limit until they were able to create a 72kb block with 514 transactions in it. Because the hash on transaction 513 and 514 in that block was computed using some random bits of memory on the mining pool's node at the time, a fork occurred. The network eventually chose one of the forks.

We could have patched the bug and carried on, as the network resolved the fork and was fine within 30 minutes of it occurring, but there was a problem with that: nodes stuck on the old fork still existed (in fact I spotted one still around the other day, and this attack occurred in September, 2014). When syncing up and receiving blocks from peers these ""stuck"" nodes are fine, *until you get to block 202612*, when suddenly it sends you a block that you cannot verify. We also found that there were some instances of nodes on the correct fork, but their transaction hashes for transactions 513/514 on block 202612 disagreed. This opened up the possibility for the attacker to spend those funds later on (or even for them to be used in a ring signature) which would cause another explosion.

Thus we had to add in a checkpoint for 202612, except that the block hash is over the block header only (ie. disregarding the actual transaction hashes), so we created an exception that uses a blob hash (ie. based on the raw block). We're actually busy refactoring that out into a more general purpose blob hash checkpoint system, partly for legibility, but also so we can use it in future if there is ever a need.",,12,xmr,t1_cpte8lk,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Like any new technology, I understand the first of any kind is likely an alpha test. A new concept will go through all of the rigorous tests that society can throw at it, from practicality, ease of use, exploitability, manipulation, spoofing/knock-off and general acceptance. Being that Bitcoin is a ‘currency’ and also acts as a ‘stock’, I figured that it was subject to the whims of the global market, making it even more susceptible to long-term failure or obsolescence. From early implementation, I was concerned that large investors or organizations with access to large computing infrastructure would corner the market or ramp up the difficulty. I watched small investors purchase GPU mining equipment, invest in ASICS and then cloud mining until the difficulty was hardly worth the effort. We then saw companies go bankrupt, investors lose their money and scammers cash out. When Litecoin and Altcoins in general started to appear, I believed the second phase of Bitcoin was starting and eventually markets would start shifting towards other coins that were still small-scale minable. I still didn’t see any noticeable traits that made Altcoins stand apart from Bitcoins, they were just clones with minor changes to the mining process, but overall they were all macro-minable. The same problem was still apparent; centralization was still possible. I have been waiting for a solid ASIC-hard coin, with privacy features and a non-Meme-Joke/immature image to invest in. I personally believe that decentralization, privacy, ease-of-use, professional brand and a dedicated DevTeam are the key features needed for a long-term successful coin. Most of the other coins with these traits were all deemed as scam-coins or were pre-mined. I have been waiting for a CPU coin that has all of the previously mentioned features without the flaws and that is actively working towards making it easier for the commoner to participate in the market. So far, Monero is number 1 on my list with all of these traits and current promises of continued development for the traits I believe that will make a coin successful in the long-term. While most Bitcoin investors believe that as difficulty becomes out of reach for most people, the price will go up; I personally believe that people will start pulling their money from Bitcoin and investing in something that continues to create currency over a long-term. Scarcity alone doesn’t create demand. Activity and perceived value creates demand. Scarcity is only valued when alternative options are not present. Cryptocurrency clearly will always have more options, therefore believing that scarcity will perpetually drive up demand is a joke. The only reason it’s still dominant is because of it’s level of acceptance. When another coin can achieve the same acceptance, Bitcoin will have nothing left working for it other than it’s PR tenure, which is also due to expire when a better solution arises. 

tl;dr Monero didn’t find me, I found Monero. True decentralization is the key to successful long-term open source currency.

Alice leaks an entire transaction? Including cryptographic proof thereof? Or does Alice accidentally Tweet ""paid 100 XMR for cocaine to 4ABCDEFG""? If she's that dumb Monero isn't going to protect her, definitely not by inconveniencing the crap out of everyone.

&gt; This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have.

So this is how Monero works: we provide the best privacy we can whilst not making Monero a complete pain to use, and still making things like optional and voluntary transparency available.

There's a level of corner cases we simply *can't* prevent, including things like Ed25519 being compromised by the NSA, or the FBI buying up 83% of the output set, or Alice putting her transaction history online.

Of course, if any of these become an actual / recurrent problem we'll see if we can mitigate them, and if not we'll raise the red flag. But our main aim with Monero is, first and foremost, to provide something that is *useful and usable* whilst still retaining as much privacy as is reasonably possible.

Monero is not trying to compete with Zerocash. In 20 or 30 years when Zerocash's cryptography has been more thoroughly vetted then I fully expect it make Monero redundant. Between now and then, though, our aim is not to deal in absolutes and not to preemptively cover every edge case at the cost of usability.

I remain unconvinced that effectively breaking the viewkey functionality and overcomplicating the wallet system provides anything more than absolutely peripheral benefits whilst preventing very few privacy-breaking edge cases.

The problems occur when that dictator is replaced with someone less capable that still wields the same power.  
  
As you go forward, please understand that the community isn't hoping and predicting that Monero will reach a Dogecoin-esque 100 million dollar market cap.  We (and I'm sure you) are envisioning that if everything works out the way we think, Monero's ""market cap"" will easily surpass the trillions.

(though I'm sure you have already forseen this + other tinfoil conspiracies).   
  
Second, as you probably already know and have seen in systems, they are highly malleable in the beginning and become more resistant to change as they grow.  Governments, human brains, information networks, etc.  Monero will be no different.  
  
Please plan that it will be trivial to hard fork six months from now, and (even if scheduled) a major pain-in-the-ass six years from now.  
  
Perhaps it doesn't even bear saying, and don't take this the wrong way: you devs are doing the thankless hard lifting and amassing unimaginable talent and effort together for this project.  But precisely because armchair speculator/critics like us are not immersed in the trenches, we have a unique perspective on the matter.  
  
That being said, it's **essential** that the team focus on the most crucial changes early, and get them in place.  Fun and fancy can come later, but key protocol changes have to happen in the first few hard forks to alleviate exponential suffering later.  **It also means the next 24 months of software development will be the most crucial in the entire history of Monero** (which could be a very long time).   
  
*You have roughly two years to establish the most essential parts of one of the most important protocols in our species' history*.

Dice sites like what? Did you bother to do any research? On a good day they had whales wagering way over BTC1000. Even if adding Monero proves successful, it's going to be a fraction of the activity/investments in BTC, so I'm pretty certain they didn't add it just to rob you of your XMRs.  
&gt; I have heard that a Monero dice site that is sponsored from a dev is coming soon  

I laughed. Is it going to be trustworthy coz 'sponsored by dev'? Which dev? And most of all who will operate it, name?  
I can tell you straight away, it will either be run by anonymous person (or with faked id), or by company registered in exotic country. In either way, they can just as well run off and there'll be nothing you can do about it.  
To summarise, it's always good to advise people to be cautious. But when when you scream 'scam' at site which already managed to gain decent level of trust and, at the same time, you advise to trust some other, new, untested, untrusted site then, to me, you just sound idiotic.  

ps. SD already have decent bankroll, so likely don't need any more investments. Bets are verifiable even by 3rd party (check their thread) and HE is only 0.5% (variable). You can test it with small amount, see whether you like it or not. There's absolutely no need for anyone to deposit or store any significant amounts there (you can deposit/withdraw every time you play).

Cryptonote and Zerocash are embedded in the protocol, making coins like Monero and future Zerocash, Fungible, and therefore true digital currencies.

In my honest view, the only reason left to develop/continue developing on Bitcoin is so that it gives leeway for other cryptocurrencies to rise to prominence, given that Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. All those things that you said Bitcoin provides, is provided by 3rd parties, and are centralized.

I'm sorry, but Satoshi said it himself about how Bitcoin's core features will never change. Therefore Bitcoin will eventually die out, it's simply too ""stone-age"", and it is in no way, shape, or form, a currency(It entirely lacks fungibility, something even Credit Cards have).

I have stopped using Bitcoin entirely except for ""HODLING"", because it makes no sense to use it. With Bitcoin, I have to go through a shit-ton of work and risk(3rd partys' exit scamming) just to remain somewhat private, and even then I can never be private because Bitcoin doesn't/won't have I2P to block IP address of nodes, while with Monero I can do absolutely nothing and remain anonymous and I2P is coming on the way... and that's how it should be.

Anyway, one more question: On poloniex they say:

Would I just write ""transfer 0 PoloniexDepositAddressHere 10 PaymentIdHere"" in simplewallet if I wanted to transfer 10 monero to Poloniex and the PaymentId would be the one they list below the deposit address?

What is the ""0"" after ""transfer"" for?

First off, it's easy to Sybil attack (by creating fake nodes), so there's a danger in that. Second problem is that you have to barely incentivise them, because if you over-incentivise then you create a Darkcoin-like scenario where there are perverse incentives (for nodes to attack each other to thin the herd, so to speak, and earn more).

There are two basic options: [Justus Ranvier's ""make everything a market"" idea](https://bitcoinism.liberty.me/2015/02/09/economic-fallacies-and-the-block-size-limit-part-2-price-discovery/) where you pay for timeliness of a node, or a scheme I came up with that smooth helped me work through that *may* be doable and somewhat simpler to implement / use. We also don't have payment channels in Monero, so Justus Ranvier's system may not be workable for us as yet.

Basically the idea I had was for nodes to be able to set a completely optional donation address. Miners will then have a default-on setting to donate all the tx fees they receive (since they aren't reliant on tx fees for profitability, as we have the minimum block reward thing) to a random node in the connection pool. The rules are that the node has to be 1. be in the whitelist, 2. have been seen in the last 24 hours, 3. have been connected to the miner node for more than 1 hour in those 24 hours.

Because it's completely optional nobody is forced into doing it, but because it's enabled by default the nodes that also have smart mining on (when that gets finished) will ensure that there are at least some miners donating. Also in order to add to this, and not make it difficult for people to cover their costs, we can traverse the network and have a running list of donation addresses that users can voluntarily donate to.

The advantage of this over something like Justus' approach is that we don't have to care about Sybil attacks, because the incentive is so small (cost-covering at best). But at the same time, it's hopefully enough incentive for people to run a $5 VPS or a node on their home network.",,2,xmr,t1_crs0o0o,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; What do you say about this https://blog.paymium.com/2014/02/19/the-cloudflare-mitm/ ?

I know David Francois very well, and we've discussed the subject on occasion. In this particular instance the benefits far outweigh the risks, especially as the information is not so sensitive that we have to worry about CloudFlare's interception (Paymium, on the other hand, have a very different threat model).

&gt; TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

I fully agree - but it *does* protect our users from being sniffed at a coffee shop, at their place of work, and even by most state-level actors.

&gt; I'm honestly struggling to use Monero. There's no PPA, no deb package, nothing.

I know, and those are extremely low on our list of priorities right now.

&gt; Really, I don't like being that asshole who just complains without doing anything, but if you care to get more people on board, you should consider usability!

We don't have the resources or the time to do everything. We're just unpaid volunteers, slowly pecking away at this. Complaining won't, unfortunately, bring in more unpaid volunteers, so we are stuck at a bit of a stalemate.

First off, it's easy to Sybil attack (by creating fake nodes), so there's a danger in that. Second problem is that you have to barely incentivise them, because if you over-incentivise then you create a Darkcoin-like scenario where there are perverse incentives (for nodes to attack each other to thin the herd, so to speak, and earn more).

There are two basic options: [Justus Ranvier's ""make everything a market"" idea](https://bitcoinism.liberty.me/2015/02/09/economic-fallacies-and-the-block-size-limit-part-2-price-discovery/) where you pay for timeliness of a node, or a scheme I came up with that smooth helped me work through that *may* be doable and somewhat simpler to implement / use. We also don't have payment channels in Monero, so Justus Ranvier's system may not be workable for us as yet.

Basically the idea I had was for nodes to be able to set a completely optional donation address. Miners will then have a default-on setting to donate all the tx fees they receive (since they aren't reliant on tx fees for profitability, as we have the minimum block reward thing) to a random node in the connection pool. The rules are that the node has to be 1. be in the whitelist, 2. have been seen in the last 24 hours, 3. have been connected to the miner node for more than 1 hour in those 24 hours.

Because it's completely optional nobody is forced into doing it, but because it's enabled by default the nodes that also have smart mining on (when that gets finished) will ensure that there are at least some miners donating. Also in order to add to this, and not make it difficult for people to cover their costs, we can traverse the network and have a running list of donation addresses that users can voluntarily donate to.

The advantage of this over something like Justus' approach is that we don't have to care about Sybil attacks, because the incentive is so small (cost-covering at best). But at the same time, it's hopefully enough incentive for people to run a $5 VPS or a node on their home network.",,2,xmr,t1_crs0o0o,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

The reality: sidechain code will work in all existing altcoins and all altcoins into the future

Feel free to make a rebuttal to that, but the general supposition is wrong. Here is why: altcoins are open source code operating on the exact same codebase. People will just increase their respective currency's network effect by adding features. The only possibility is that it dilutes mining difficulty a little bit, temporarily.

For instance, there is no reason to add a dogecoin sidechain to bitcoin. Dogecoin has no features aside from a faster confirmation time LIKE EVERY OTHER ALTCOIN or new sidechaincoin that you can make out of thin air. Similarly, there is no reason to add a litecoin sidechain to bitcoin, it does not add features.

Dogecoin and Litecoin, for instance, would add a ring signature sidechain for people that want to pop in and out of anonymity.

Monero and cryptonote protocol would also be able to adopt the same technology. Monero could add a bitcoin-core based sidechain (with faster confirmation times and newer algorithm) so that people could list counterparty assets or use colored coins. Something that cryptonote would have to otherwise develop from scratch.

So Blockstream and whoever else is promoting sidechains is not telling the full story, but it isn't a conspiracy or anything, you just have to understand how open source code works and use your own cognition to synthesize details.

What do you say about this https://blog.paymium.com/2014/02/19/the-cloudflare-mitm/ ?

TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

I'm honestly struggling to use Monero. There's no PPA, no deb package, nothing. The binaries on the site don't work as is. I had to run a script that a helpful guy linked me to in a forum.

Acting as a reverse proxy is the only way they can shield us from being trivially attacked or DDoS'd. Think about how much time and effort we'd have to spend moving servers, setting up DR infrastructure, and then failing over to environment-after-environment just because some script kiddie managed to download LOIC. We have neither the time nor the money for that.

&gt; CloudFlare is a spyware site owners are voluntarily installing, against their customers.

We use Google Analytics so they already have access.

If we hosted the site on a VPS the host would have access.

If we hosted it on dedicated hardware the DC would have access.

If we collocated the upstream bandwidth provider would have access.

Even if we do ALL of that untold numbers of users have data-gathering toolbars installed from which information can be extrapolated.

&gt; But on monero's website? Wasn't this altcoin community supposed to be... I don't know... in support of privacy?

Yes, and *our* privacy is very important (including where the server is hosted and so on). There is absolutely no value in trying to protect clearweb users, as it's a goal that is impossible to achieve. Paranoid users won't even touch the website, and will just compile Monero themselves, so expending time and energy on what is effectively a convenience feature would be misplaced.

&gt; The official monero site should definitely drop CloudFlare

https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-transparency-report-on-national-security-orders/

https://blog.cloudflare.com/fighting-back-responsibly/

No company is perfect, but I think for this particular convenience service it's better to trust CloudFlare over some-random-web-hosting-service. Also, from a performance perspective I know they can be a bit hit-and-miss, but that is a situation that can only improve.

Some of us peripherally knew other members of the core team, so our binding factor was ""right place, right time"" plus each of us not being completely, utterly retarded.

2. I think the viewkey functionality solves that problem entirely. Oppressive governments can demand their citizens hand over their viewkeys, more permissive governments can ask that they volunteer them for tax / regulation purposes. Neither of those governments can know if you have a private account or accounts (the privacy-leaking edge cases is what we're tightening up right now through things like i2p integration) so it really is ""private by default, optionally transparent"".
3. We have infinite supply (the block reward reduces to a minimum of 0.3 XMR in ~8 years and then stays at that value indefinitely) so late comers won't feel left out - it's a slightly inflationary cryptocurrency, not deflationary.
4. I think for something like Monero technical excellence will outstrip the competition. Anyone who knows about decentralised security software design and cryptography, and wants to get involved and contribute, would gravitate towards contributing to Monero rather than launch a competitor. Additionally, we're already diverging away from CryptoNote and will continue to do so quite dramatically (to fix their shortcomings and introduce new functionality), so a competitor would have to be forked from us.
5. Darknote is an outlier, I can't tell if they're part of the Bytecoin / CryptoNote scam, but they're certainly an interesting proposition if you want a currency that implements the CN protocol and won't veer away.

If somebody is doing the extra work to keep a pseudonym, that is evidence that they are *more* serious. Serious about protecting themselves, serious about protecting the project (developers who can be found are targets for outside pressure), and serious about the value of anonymity in general... which in the case of Monero is a big deal.

Anyway, what's healthy for the ecosystem is when you trust math more and people less.

I am a fan of monero, and I hold lots of cryptocoins - but $20k is a serious investment for anyone. I recognize that you're doing dd and I appreciate that, but the thing that concerns me is your long-term vision. 

* First, you haven't missed the boat on bitcoin by any stretch. It kills me when I hear people say that. There are about 2 million bitcoin holders in the world out of a world population of 8 billion. If bitcoin is successful in the longterm it will appreciate steeply in value from its current position - so you haven't missed the boat. At this moment I would still invest 95% of any new capital into bitcoin. My personal technique is to play with the other coins to keep me distracted from trading/spending/losing bitcoin.

* Second, I do think Monero is a neat concept, but at this point is simply that - a concept coin. I'm buying a few and hoping it does something but the truth is that concept coins are released very frequently and I would guess that &lt;1% ever do anything with their concept. They look exciting and they're all going to change the word - but I haven't seen much of that yet. Darkcoin is notable because it has taken code-based steps to increase anonymity, but Monero is really just a clone of Bytecoin at this moment. (Yes, I'm still hopeful and expectant for it.) If you hang out six weeks you'll see other coins that grab your attention and look VERY exciting for a few weeks only to see the pump and dump cycle leave them worthless in the end.

* Third, there will be others! Cryptocurrency is a rapidly evolving space. So rapid that none of us has any real concept what it will look like in 9 months. Nine months ago we were all interested in ""crapcoins"" - direct clones of bitcoin that offered no substantial change except a change in branding and a new philosophy. We ARE seeing the first iteration of 2.0 coins now, but I don't even consider Monero a 2.0 coin. I define 2.0 coins (at this moment) as coins that have the programming infrastructure to manage DAO's.

Bytecoin devs have no desire to change this status quo.

It seems to me, and to others, the Bytecoin is not 2 years old. It is much newer, has a faked blockchain to back the story up, and is thus just a massive premine under the veil of being a coin released fairly ""on the dark web 2 years ago"".

&gt;Monero  is a fork of Bytecoin launched in April 2014 with a 1 minute block target. This coin has been launched as BitMonero but renamed to Monero by its community. Few weeks after Monero's launch, an optimized GPU miner for CryptoNight hash has been developed.  Monero development team states official GUI wallet release as one of their primary goals.  Monero teamed up with academic cryptographers,  implemented an extensive aliasing system, OpenAlias,  partially funded Privacy Solution for integrating [I2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P) in Monero,  created an anonymous voting system, URS,  implemented Electrum's mnemonic seeds and released a webwallet.

Possiblity 4: Alice leaks. I've already talked about that.

&gt; In all three of the possibilities listed above it doesn't matter that you've obtained the address, since you've obtained them from the sender she can just tell you who she paid.

We're going in circles now. There are lots of paths to leak things like that that don't require total compromise of all Alice's communications.

&gt; If Bob's address is public knowledge then her having it, or having it in a contact on her phone, is actually a protection: you can't arrest someone for knowing something that is public.

You keep making it about arresting people. It's not, necessarily. Not even primarily. And lots of people are willing to make Alice suffer in various ways based on information that's not reliable enough to convict you of anything. The average Alice is more at risk from her jealous boyfriend or her boss.

However, if you want it to be about arresting people, let's talk about that. I am not a lawyer or a cop, but I do have some relevant general and professional knowledge. I'm talking about US law here, because that's what I know best. The US isn't atypical in the West, although of course the details vary. As for the rest of the world, be assured that if I were talking about Saudi Arabia investigating apostasy, the protections would not be nearly so strong.

The ""contact"" example isn't exactly on point here, because US law enforcement *can't* legally just go trolling through people's contacts. But let's run with it. It's not *totally* implausible.

Google, as a private actor, is not bound by rules about illegal searches. Google could turn Alice's information over to the cops if it suspected criminal activity based on Bob's address being there. The cops could legally use that information. Alice might be able to sue Google in civil court later (I'm not sure). But there's legislation under discussion that would definitely immunize Google against that. So it's not COMPLETELY farfetched.

In fact, they already do something along those lines by searching people's data for child porn files (they compare them against a hash list). Those files are very unambiguous evidence compared to a contact, but the principle is similar. So they might not even be suable *now*.

Anyway, suppose the LEAs do somehow legitimately find out that Alice has Bob's address in her contacts. If they find out Alice has Bob's address somewhere else, the rest plays out similarly.

If Bob is a known drug dealer or whatever, and you believe that he doesn't use the address for anything else, and Alice is specifically carrying around Bob's drug dealing address and not, say, a giant directory of lots of random people's addresses, then they probably could, in fact, legally arrest Alice. But they wouldn't. Which doesn't mean Alice is out of the woods.

In the US, you *can*, in theory, arrest Alice if you have ""probable cause"" to believe that she's done something criminal. That means information that would lead a reasonable person to think that there was a 51 percent chance. I believe that the information you base that on has to be untainted by previous illegal searches and whatever. You'd have to talk to an actual lawyer for details on that.

A court might very well agree that Alice's having that address was probable cause to believe she bought drugs from Bob. They're awfully free about that, especially if the cops throw in some generalities about Alice's ""furtive behavior"" or whatever leading to their ""professional judgement"" that she's a likely suspect.

What they could *not* do with that probable cause would be to *convict* Alice of anything. That takes ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". And it's kind of a waste of time to arrest people you can't convict.

But it's enough to engage their interest, at least if Bob is a wholesaler and his customers might therefore be dealers themselves.

If they *do* have probable cause, that's enough to get a warrant to search Alice's house, tap her phone, or whatever... in which case she's going to have her life messed with, and if she's actually guilty they're very likely going to find a lot more evidence to convict her. THEN they arrest her.

Even if they do *not* have probable cause, they definitely have ""reasonable suspicion"". On reasonable suspicion, they can do a variety of things. One of those is set up what's called a ""PEN register"", which is basically a log of everybody Alice talks to on the phone, when, and for how long (it's named after the old technology for doing it).

If Alice's calls are even *suspicious* (say to head shops, lab supply, whatever), let alone being to other known drug dealers, then they can combine that with the Monero address and turn the whole thing into probable cause for a warrant. At which point Alice can, again, be arrested and likely convicted.

100 percent legal.

This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have. You use it to get more information, and you use it to get authorization to use more intrusive means of investigation. You iterate until you have the evidence you need. Every piece of information helps, and once you have enough to make you suspicious, you can usually generate more.

By the way, something similar would play out if they busted *Bob* for some reason, found *Alice's* address in his ""professional"" contacts, and the tracked her by Google or whatever.

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Personally, I think Darkcoin will take over the illicit elements of Bitcoin in the near term as Bitcoin becomes more ""legitimate"".  Eventually, we will see another massive bitcoin bubble, and the powers that be will take note of and crack down on Darkcoin.  People running Masternodes in the US and extraditable countries will be fucked and the price of Darkcoin will tank.  This may or may not kill it... depends on how decentralized it has become by that point.

As for Monero (and Darkcoin), the biggest threat I see is a Bitcoin 2-way pegged CryptoNote sidechain; Essentially Monero backed by Bitcoin.  I think such is the fate of all altcoins eventually.

Perfectly secure cryptography exists (one-time pads) but the size of the keys *must be at least as large* as the size of the messages. If we are willing to allow for imperfectly secure, but still computationally nasty, cryptography,  we can make keys smaller. But there is a trade-off. As keys get smaller, codes leak more and more information.   Bitcoin has relatively small keys,  but Bitcoin is linkable and traceable.  Monero has large keys and unconditional unlinkability... but there are still some traceability issues. Zero knowledge techniques are massive but leak even less information.

So,  yeah, someone may be able to come up with a reduction in blockchain size,  but I suspect that it will just be by a constant rather than any significant reduction. Sublinear ring signatures would be nice,  though... edited to add: due to Moore's law, I think it will be unnecessary in a few years anyway.

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I pointed out that this is a non-issue because the outputs are all denominated by decimal value (e.g. 12.34 = 10 + 2 + 0.3 + 0.04) so there are always a huge number of matching outputs.

Anonymint correctly pointed that this increases the blockchain size (more outputs in a tx). A technically illiterate forum member by the name of AlexGR used this to FUD Monero because he's a big investor in Darkcoin (DRK). It didn't occur to this guy that DRK also uses a denomination scheme and bloats the blockchain relative to Bitcoin. :)

At this point in time, DRK had a bit of a problem because it still had nothing to show and it's simple CoinJoin would be on obsolete on arrival anyway. The developer Evan Duffield declared that he would implement ring signatures in ""version 2"".

A few days later he realized he's out of his depth and has no chance (he's a coder, not a cryptographer). But he had to save face so he announced he's going to stick with CoinJoin because the new cryptography is unsafe and it bloats the chain. So begins the misguided FUD.

A literate user of course realizes that it doesn't actually matter that XMR, DRK, Zerocoin or anything else has a larger chain (unless it was bigger by a factor of several hundred or more, far outpacing memory growth). In the end, a full node doesn't have any storage problems and the rest of us are not going to be running full nodes anyway.

Monero's value will come from usefulness (utility), not from overall scarcity and some numbers fudged on a spreadsheet. When it has utility there will be a natural and gradual price increase, as demand will slightly outstrip supply due to ever-increasing utility (a Monero network effect).

But all of this will take time - maybe even several years to play out.

As a first stop, I'll reiterate [my post from Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.msg8246348#msg8246348) on creating a secure offline wallet:

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.
4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.
9. Write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed.
10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.
11. Switch off the computer, remove the battery if there is one, and leave it physically off for a few hours.

There you go - the wallet you've created was created in RAM, and the digital files are now lost forever. If some magical hacker manages to somehow get the data, they will lack the long password to open it. If you need to receive payments, you have the address, and you have the view key if needed. If you need access to it, you have your 24 word seed, and you can now write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever. Then write a bunch of extra love letters. That way, if your deposit box is ever discovered, it'll be disregarded as unimportant love letters.

**Creating a secure, online wallet**

Create a new wallet on your computer, using a reasonably secure password or passphrase, and write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed. You can transact using your wallet, knowing that if the wallet files are stolen it is extremely unlikely that an attacker will be able to brute-force your password (wallet files are quite heavily encrypted).

The same process of securing your 24 word seed as with the offline wallet applies: write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever.

&gt;Monero  is a fork of Bytecoin launched in April 2014 with a 1 minute block target. This coin has been launched as BitMonero but renamed to Monero by its community. Few weeks after Monero's launch, an optimized GPU miner for CryptoNight hash has been developed.  Monero development team states official GUI wallet release as one of their primary goals.  Monero teamed up with academic cryptographers,  implemented an extensive aliasing system, OpenAlias,  partially funded Privacy Solution for integrating [I2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P) in Monero,  created an anonymous voting system, URS,  implemented Electrum's mnemonic seeds and released a webwallet.

Using a probabilistic model, an attacker could still infer that transactions within a relatively short time interval, which include inputs from the same transaction, are related with a high probability. That is, the chance of having n inputs from the same transaction within m blocks of each other would have a probability of roughly around:

(m * (average mixin factor) * (average transactions per block) / (transactions in blockchain))^n

Now, I don't have the numbers to run that calculation handy, but I believe that an attacker could quickly reach a high confidence, especially if the transactions are not only in nearby blocks, but also have identical mixin and similar denominations.

Edit: I think there may be something wrong with my reasoning above, but I'm too tired to take care of it right now.

Adding  
a) multiple inputs from the same random transactions as mixins  
b) with a random chance (1%-10%?)  
c) once above a certain mixin factor, to avoid some active attacks  
would, in my opinion, provide a stronger defense while also preventing attackers from eliminating ""identified"" outputs from future ring signatures. Finding transactions that fit may be difficult though.

Alternatively, it should be possible to automatically slowly spread out outputs in a wallet over a sufficiently big time interval that the probability given above is high enough not to allow an attacker to infer anything about the transactions.

&gt; I would guess you need ~5-10 or so in practice

That sounds about right to me.

&gt; Over time a wallet builds up a set of input transactions to work from so this isn't needed.

I see some use cases, which seem somewhat common, were this is unlikely to happen though. For example, somebody who buys a big amount of Monero once, while it is cheap (e.g. now) and then holds, with occasional spends, wouldn't accumulate enough input transactions.",,1,,t1_ck5dymp,t5_31hbr,,1409522744,,,,,,,,,,,

* There is a new website: http://www.getmonero.org 
     This features updated design
     There are sections for missives, a blog, the forum, and a work in progress knowledgebase
     There is a new design and research goals plan with a graphical map:  http://getmonero.org/design-goals/
     The website is open and stored in the git repository and the devs are welcoming community contribution

* There is a new research paper at  http://lab.monero.cc
     MRL4 - http://lab.monero.cc/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf
     The idea is they are researching anonymity vs mixin levels and how this can be improved.  This is a furtherization of MRL 001
     They talked about unlinkability and untraceability ... two different things.
     They talked about disallowing a 0 mixin transaction except under special circumstances.

* Age based associations (temporal associations):  There is also new understanding that it is possible to determine the age of coins moved in some circumstances.  The info is based on the way inputs are chosen.   This problem is less important than the MRL 004 problem, and very simple.  The risk is basically Panic when early coins are detected as being moved.

*  Towards the end of the talk they highlight the design and development goals I mention above ^^^  http://getmonero.org/design-goals/

* They discuss how important it is to have libraries finished for 3rd party implementations for things like iOs/Android etc so not only can the wallet be coded well, but others can develop apps etc via these tools.

* They defend the slow development pace (&lt;-that is semi editorial) by saying they are still carefully laying groundwork for an enterprise grade product as opposed to trying to just make things like wallets. For example the library development as opposed to a WALLET NOW.",,2,,t1_couhndi,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

How do you get that? I said: ""Even if you had all of the addresses of every Monero user it wouldn't be enough. *You need more information.*""

The addresses aren't enough to give you ANY usable information. If knowing every Monero address on the planet can give you usable information you need to be specific about that.

&gt; But that doesn't mean that the way the wallet software works doesn't have an enormous impact on when and whether one-time addresses actually get used

Every transaction output *already is paid to a one-time address*. There's no reason to overcomplicate it *for everyone* beyond that. If someone wants to write a wallet that doesn't reuse addresses they're welcome to.

&gt; It's a different thing to trust a third party with what amounts to the True Name of the recipient.

To be honest, discussing hypothetically how our hypothetical multi-sig may work with a hypothetical robo-signer is premature. I also don't think you can possibly have a robo-signer that doesn't know the real destination, otherwise how can they compare it with (for eg.) a whitelist of addresses you've provided? How can they measure velocity to a single payee? Robo-signers *require* more information. You need to think of a better example to illustrate your point.

4. Ah yes, I vaguely remember that.

The bottom line is that Monero doesn't have a cushy premine / instamine to rely on for funding, and we don't have enough volunteers to handle things like cross-platform functional testing, release engineering, devops, continuous integration, and so on.

You are getting excellence in software development and architecture at a big fat cost of nothing, but we are only a handful of people scattered around the globe. If you want things to happen faster you have two options: wait for us to get to it, or do it yourself. If you choose to wait then you have the option of paying for it to go faster, else you have to abide by the timelines of a collective of unpaid, part-time volunteers who also have to work to make a living.",,4,xmr,t1_cr5cb0b,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.
4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.
9. Write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed.
10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.
11. Switch off the computer, remove the battery if there is one, and leave it physically off for a few hours.

There you go - the wallet you've created was created in RAM, and the digital files are now lost forever. If some magical hacker manages to somehow get the data, they will lack the long password to open it. If you need to receive payments, you have the address, and you have the view key if needed. If you need access to it, you have your 24 word seed, and you can now write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever. Then write a bunch of extra love letters. That way, if your deposit box is ever discovered, it'll be disregarded as unimportant love letters.",,5,xmr,t1_cpli18k,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;Monero  is a fork of Bytecoin launched in April 2014 with a 1 minute block target. This coin has been launched as BitMonero but renamed to Monero by its community. Few weeks after Monero's launch, an optimized GPU miner for CryptoNight hash has been developed.  Monero development team states official GUI wallet release as one of their primary goals.  Monero teamed up with academic cryptographers,  implemented an extensive aliasing system, OpenAlias,  partially funded Privacy Solution for integrating [I2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P) in Monero,  created an anonymous voting system, URS,  implemented Electrum's mnemonic seeds and released a webwallet.

A proper post mortem of the attack is what [MRL-0002, ""Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing the CryptoNote Protocol""](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0002.pdf), is all about, and is a worthy read.

The long and the short of it is: the tree-hash.c code that is responsible for transaction hashes within a block had a bug in it whereby any hashes for more than 512 transactions would be computed using uninitialised memory (ie. with garbage). So the attacker slowly built up the dynamic block size limit until they were able to create a 72kb block with 514 transactions in it. Because the hash on transaction 513 and 514 in that block was computed using some random bits of memory on the mining pool's node at the time, a fork occurred. The network eventually chose one of the forks.

We could have patched the bug and carried on, as the network resolved the fork and was fine within 30 minutes of it occurring, but there was a problem with that: nodes stuck on the old fork still existed (in fact I spotted one still around the other day, and this attack occurred in September, 2014). When syncing up and receiving blocks from peers these ""stuck"" nodes are fine, *until you get to block 202612*, when suddenly it sends you a block that you cannot verify. We also found that there were some instances of nodes on the correct fork, but their transaction hashes for transactions 513/514 on block 202612 disagreed. This opened up the possibility for the attacker to spend those funds later on (or even for them to be used in a ring signature) which would cause another explosion.

Thus we had to add in a checkpoint for 202612, except that the block hash is over the block header only (ie. disregarding the actual transaction hashes), so we created an exception that uses a blob hash (ie. based on the raw block). We're actually busy refactoring that out into a more general purpose blob hash checkpoint system, partly for legibility, but also so we can use it in future if there is ever a need.",,12,xmr,t1_cpte8lk,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Thought I’d let you know about a few tools we developed for Altcoin Communities.

Firstly the comprehensive price index on the home page (bravenewcoin.com). 

Click on the arrow to the right of any coin to see a nice dropdown chart. 

Then check out Embeddable tickers page here http://bravenewcoin.com/tickers/

Just select whichever coin you want and copy/paste the code for that coin, displayed below, into your website design. 

We also have a coin profile page here http://bravenewcoin.com/coins/monero which acts like an info hub. 

We collect data from over 50 exchanges in over 23 trading pairs for over 65 coins. We have worked tirelessly for months securing out methodology, data processing and infrastructure. Our data is at a level where we can start supplying government or corporates with custom feeds. 

Our production schedule for August includes: Comprehensive Bitcoin Directory, zerohedge.com style community news section, Profiles for all Exchanges, profiles for hundreds of Crypto-Currency related companies.

Production Schedule for mid August to Dec includes: Comprehensive portfolio management tools and much needed Quickbooks, Fastbooks, MYOB &amp; Xero accounting software plugins. 

Lastly we have an Android App available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Techemy.BraveNewCoin 

The iOS version is coming in the next 2 weeks. An update is coming for Android in the next 2 weeks that includes being able to ‘favorite’ coins, having the coins summary on the home screen click-able to the data page and sorting of home screen by volume or other metrics. 

Check us out and any feedback is welcome

1. As a side note, the bloat being produced with the very low fees from before was not a malicious attack, but rather pools being a bit overly-zealous in payout frequency.  This caused a lot of ""dust"" to be created, and consequently a lot of blockchain bloat from the transactions therein.  
Another defense mechanism against bloat is that the soft cap on block size increases rather slowly.  Should the blockchain start to increase in size rapidly again we could coordinate with pool operators and miners to increase minimum fees again.  This is not ideal, as someone could theoretically execute a bloat attack to raise fees (and therefore make monero slightly less appealing by causing ordinary users to have higher fees), but to do so would, to my knowledge, be prohibitively expensive.  
This is a very interesting topic however, and rest assured that we do discuss these sort of things quite often.

However, If you are wondering why 1 BCN is worth 0.00000009 BTC and 1 Monero is worth 0.03 BTC, well that's mainly because of the total amount of coins. Monero has a much smaller total amount of coins than Bytecoin. For this reason, 1 Monero is far rarer than 1 Bytecoin.

&gt; There is literally nothing we can do to prevent statistics from being gathered. What we CAN do, though, is provide end-to-end strict TLS from users to our servers, and do so in a way that protects and shields our infrastructure (thus reducing that risk profile down to very sophisticated and highly motivated attackers only).

What do you say about this https://blog.paymium.com/2014/02/19/the-cloudflare-mitm/ ?

TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

In addition, the simple fact that CloudFlare (and you can definitely put Google Analytics in that too) is used by so many sites nowadays make it worse than a typical VPS. Their database, being so much larger and having so much data about so many people, becomes much more interesting to hackers.

&gt; The solution to this special case is a transaction split for the denominated values so that Intersect(ST^i, ...) is empty. In the bigger picture, O^1 ... O^7 then look just as if they were mixins used by someone else but end up in separate transactions. Spreading over blocks reduces circumstantial association.

After mulling over this for a bit, I'm not sure it is enough. Using a probabilistic model, an attacker could still infer that transactions within a relatively short time interval, which include inputs from the same transaction, are related with a high probability. That is, the chance of having n inputs from the same transaction within m blocks of each other would have a probability of roughly around:

(m * (average mixin factor) * (average transactions per block) / (transactions in blockchain))^n

Now, I don't have the numbers to run that calculation handy, but I believe that an attacker could quickly reach a high confidence, especially if the transactions are not only in nearby blocks, but also have identical mixin and similar denominations.

Edit: I think there may be something wrong with my reasoning above, but I'm too tired to take care of it right now.

Adding  
a) multiple inputs from the same random transactions as mixins  
b) with a random chance (1%-10%?)  
c) once above a certain mixin factor, to avoid some active attacks  
would, in my opinion, provide a stronger defense while also preventing attackers from eliminating ""identified"" outputs from future ring signatures. Finding transactions that fit may be difficult though.

Alternatively, it should be possible to automatically slowly spread out outputs in a wallet over a sufficiently big time interval that the probability given above is high enough not to allow an attacker to infer anything about the transactions.

&gt; I would guess you need ~5-10 or so in practice

That sounds about right to me.

&gt; Over time a wallet builds up a set of input transactions to work from so this isn't needed.

I see some use cases, which seem somewhat common, were this is unlikely to happen though.

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.
4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.
9. Write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed.
10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.
11. Switch off the computer, remove the battery if there is one, and leave it physically off for a few hours.

There you go - the wallet you've created was created in RAM, and the digital files are now lost forever. If some magical hacker manages to somehow get the data, they will lack the long password to open it. If you need to receive payments, you have the address, and you have the view key if needed. If you need access to it, you have your 24 word seed, and you can now write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever. Then write a bunch of extra love letters. That way, if your deposit box is ever discovered, it'll be disregarded as unimportant love letters.",,5,xmr,t1_cpli18k,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero  
https://github.com/tippero/tippero  
https://github.com/roosmaa/go-monero  
https://github.com/netmonk/moneronjs  
https://github.com/TheKoziTwo/xmr-integration  
https://github.com/openalias/dnscrypt-python  
https://github.com/openalias/openalias-api  
https://github.com/Jojatekok/MoneroGui.Net  
https://github.com/jwinterm/lightWallet

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

In other words: even if you ignore the features/aspects of Monero that give it real fungibility, several of these other features are things that Bitcoin almost certainly won't ever add. I mention them in the talk I've been giving at the meetups in Europe, so I'll cut-and-paste from those slides:

- *Slightly Inflationary:* To retain mining incentive there is a minimum block reward of 0.3 XMR kicks in around May, 2022, and will stay at that amount indefinitely.

- *No Block Limits:* Block size is dynamically limited based on a look-back window. As Monero’s usage increases, block size will naturally increase.

- *Disconnected Architecture:* The daemon keeps your connection to the network. Account/wallet implementations, including CLI and RPC apps, talk to the daemon.

- *Different Crypto:* Uses Ed25519 / Curve25519 / EdDSA, whereas Bitcoin uses secp256k1 / ECDSA. Neither is inherently superior, really.

- *Accessible PoW:* Lowers the performance gap between CPU, GPU, FPGA, &amp; ASIC mining. Should allow even CPU mining for the foreseeable future.

All of this doesn't mean that Monero will be successful. But we're also not trying to ""compete"" with Bitcoin. I believe that we each serve different purposes, and that's ok.

I've put in bold the part that doesn't make sense.

Knowing Bob's address doesn't help them get a transaction history from Alice. Alice doesn't have a transaction history that includes the destination address, her transaction history merely includes the transactions. The only extra information Alice has in her wallet history, that isn't on a block explorer, is which of the transaction's outputs came back to her in the form of change.

Practically:

The Monero donation address is 46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em

Here I am transferring 1 Monero to the donation address:

    [wallet 49VNLa]: transfer 3 46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em 1
    Money successfully sent, transaction &lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

And here's the transaction on a block explorer: http://chainradar.com/xmr/transaction/4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0

The 1 XMR output that went to the donation address is 9844d5f4d7ab22dab1dc1815578654c54115f19155ebc6995ab2569718f0905c, and that bears no relation to the actual address.

Thus knowing both the addresses has no value, no matter how big your database of addresses is.

Similarly, in my wallet this is all I can see for that transaction:

    [wallet 49VNLa]: incoming_transfers
            amount       	spent	global index	                              tx id
    &lt;-- snip --&gt;
           0.030000000000	  F  	      195895	&lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

ie. all I can see are those two change outputs that came back to me.

And in the recipient wallet:

    [wallet 46BeWr]: incoming_transfers
            amount       	spent	global index	                              tx id
    &lt;-- snip --&gt;
           1.000000000000	  F  	      545645	&lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

Even if you had all of the addresses of every Monero user it wouldn't be enough. *You need more information*.

&gt; Every time she makes a payment, she has to tell that service provider who she's paying

Having a third-party robosigning for you means that you trust that third-party implicitly with your data. It's unlikely to be tenable if the third-party is the sort that will resell your data, but for some people they're willing to compromise their privacy for convenience, so your point is taken.

We cannot stop people from publishing their transaction history on the Internet, but as you can see in my practical example earlier it isn't much use.

Obviously if Alice wants to publicly state that she paid Bob 10 XMR and is able to reveal the public keys for that transaction's inputs (which can be hashed and compared against the key images) then that's her prerogative, but it doesn't reveal any of Bob's other transactions (both received or sent).

&gt; She buys a ticket to another town using Monero

This won't exist in future once we've completed our work on stealth payment IDs (see the research goals here: https://getmonero.org/design-goals/), as any automated service would (by definition) require the payment to have a payment ID. The ""address"" on the clipboard would include a serialised payment ID, so her boyfriend would need to be adept enough to manually unpack and deserialise the address, repack it into an address without a payment ID, and then the train company needs to have published their address somewhere at some stage (unlikely if they only start using Monero from when stealth payment IDs are complete).

&gt; She uploads her contact to Google

If she's paying Bob privately and he's not using stealth payment IDs (see above) then it's the same as Alice having his email address (which, let's say, is totally_not_weird_bob@gmail.com). All of those connections to Bob can be made by her accidentally uploading the contact with his email.

Also let's be clear: *there is no practical way to enforce one-time address use on a protocol level*, as nodes can never tell what the destination address of an output is. It doesn't matter what we do on the client side, people are going to reuse addresses (just like they do with Bitcoin) because it's convenient and people tend to do dumb things regardless of who it hurts. Even if we *could* enforce it Alice would still need to contact Bob to get a payment address each time, so she'd have his number or email that would trip her up in the same way.",,3,xmr,t1_cqn8vx8,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Truth is we are not trying to merely create a GUI, as in a GUI wrapper. Fact is these simple wrappers already exist (Neozaru, Jojatekok and jwinterm's and we could probably use Bitcoin wallet, like Pebblecoin does).

What we are trying to build is **scalable** GUI software. And *scalable* is the hard part, not *GUI*.

## What is scalable?

* Mnemonic seed for increased security ([why](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/isnt-mnemonic-seed-and-inability-change-words-security-holes)).
* Low RAM footprint (""the DB"", presently [Symas Lightning MDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) but later a lot others, since we built a database API).
* e-commerce prerequisites, notably for payment processors.
* Low bandwith footprint (a framework for SPV, like Electrum). The [remote node](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/how-use-remote-node) provides a similar experience in that one doesn't have to download the whole blockchain, but this is where the similarities end and SPV would be lighter than a remote node.
- Much better understood (thus secure) and refactored code. This is behind-the-scene stuff and not sexy, but when it comes to securing your money, this matters. The Monero Protocol is sound, but we are not that comfortable with the source code we inherited in April (and improved since then). Note: we are pretty demanding on security, so when I say that ""we are not that comfortable"", this means the security is already high, just not high enough :)
- Gitian binaries
- Various mainstream users niceties, such as an address book, an easy way to do bookeeping (including easily report to tax offices, because Monero is not meant just for l33t haX0r, but for everyone, including legal persons like corporations, NGO, political parties...)
- Viewkey for optional transparency (see fluffy quote on Three Pilllars)
- Have a solid foundation for easy improvements later on (like third-parties improvements). Because once the (scalable) GUI wallet will be there, we expect things to accelerate - and we rather be ready for the acceleration. Fasten your seatbelt, Dorothy. 

## Why is scalable important?

Because it is one of the three pillars :)

More seriously, because once the official GUI wallet will be there, visibility will increase a lot. Which means more users who know nothing about Monero and later not even about cryptocurrencies. These people won't give a second thought. One does only one first impression. It *must* be the right one. Hence the necessity for a wallet than can handle the load. Be scalable, not that much on a technical standpoint than on a, say, ""political"" standpoint.

Monero is inherently inflationary, contrary to Bitcoin, this is more than enough reason for me to prefer Monero and is the reason many more people will never join Bitcoin (with or without sidechains) this feature not only is fair to the future generations because it allows wealth regeneration in large periods of time (100+ years) but it will protect the network without the need of transactions fees, this is just an example of something Bitcoin can never offer.

None of the projects you mentioned, including sidechains are enough to draw any reaction from me away from Monero, Bitcoin feels corrupted both as community (scams, dramas, etc) as an open-source project (can't scale, fungibility problems, etc). None of this is against any of the current BTC developers from whom personally I have sincere admiration, specially petertodd and gmaxwell. They, like the current Monero devs, inherited an uncertain project from unknown figures that may forever remain elusive.

This claim about it ""being used on a few services on the deep web"" also lacks any basis. A screenshot of this Library Unicorn service with one mention on the entire page doth-not-a-claim-validate.

I have never doubted that and never said I doubted it. Seriously, whatever's on the block chain, and whatever's sent in the protocol, has nothing to with my issue. Nor do I doubt your assertion that the wallet software doesn't keep a history of addresses it's sent money to.

All of my concerns are about leakage *outside of and around* the actual Monero software.

What I'm saying is that Alice is going to be leaky. She is going to make mistakes, and those mistakes are sometimes going to disclose the addresses she's paying to. Sometimes she'll make technical mistakes, and sometimes she'll just trust the wrong people or software. Alice will leak recipient addresses through pathways that are *not part of the wallet, not part of the block chain, and in no way under your control*. Sometimes Alice will even leak for actually rational reasons.

If you encourage Bob to make his address a unique identifier for him, or even for one of his lines of business, that makes Alice's leakiness a bigger risk for her (and probably for him, too).

You seem to be taking the position that Alice just shouldn't leak. But that's not how real users work in the real world. You have to do everything possible to *help* Alice not to leak... and then assume she will anyway, and try to minimize the impact of that.

&gt; Also let's be clear: *there is no practical way to enforce one-time address use on a protocol level*

Obviously not. But that doesn't mean that the way the wallet software works doesn't have an enormous impact on when and whether one-time addresses *actually get used*. Not only does it affect the relative convenience, but it affects the expectations that get built up, and sometimes locked in, in surrounding systems.

It also affects the profitability for attackers of developing tools and capabilities to exploit the address reuse case, and that matters in practice.

&gt; Having a third-party robosigning for you means that you trust that third-party implicitly with your data.

Um, that really depends on what you mean by ""my data"".

It's one thing to trust a third party with a unique ephemeral recipient address that will only ever be used in one transaction, knowing that it's relatively likely that the address really is ephemeral, because the whole surrounding system is built to make that the path of least resistance.

It's a different thing to trust a third party with what amounts to the True Name of the recipient.

There are gradations and variations, of course. For example, for this particular case, you could do something like a Bitcoin stealth address, and have Alice generate an address she *knew* was unique to hand to the third party. In that case, she could still leak the underlying stealth address, but she at least wouldn't be forced to give full information to the third party.

&gt;&gt; She uploads her contact to Google

&gt; If she's paying Bob privately and he's not using stealth payment IDs (see above) then it's the same as Alice having his email address (which, let's say, is totally_not_weird_bob@gmail.com). All of those connections to Bob can be made by her accidentally uploading the contact with his email.

Yes, it's true that any other publicly known identifier for Bob is equally dangerous.

But this is a good example of how reality intrudes, and how little details can make people change people's behavior to make them leak. Bob's email address isn't 96 characters of base64. Alice can memorize Bob's email address easily enough. Or she can obfuscate it in a way that she can reverse mentally. She can't do either with a Monero address, so she has more incentive to store it in a database somewhere (contacts or otherwise).

Furthermore, if she's not like you or me, Alice is less likely to subjectively *realize* that she needs to protect that address. She's got a very good chance of seeing Bob's email address as a name for Bob, and a significantly smaller chance of recognizing his Monero address as one.

No actually its not. Bytecoin is more profitable according to the [Minergate](https://minergate.com/calc) calculator. 

1000h/s gets you 77760 BCN or 1.563 XMR

So XMR profitability is 1.563 * 0.0031 (current XMR exchange rate - low) = 0.0048453 BTC

and BCN profitability is 77760 BCN * 0.00000007 (current BCN exchange rate - also low) = 0.0054432

That's incredible that they have that much money to spare for that project though crowdfunding. In hindsight, if Moolah was dragging its feet on the technical end then surely the same kind of majorly generous crowdfunding could have gone toward funding something that apparently the currency would die without? Also, I'm having trouble understanding this: The car fund was crowdfunded, but the ""buying (of) that NASCAR sponsorship wasn't really a team effort. Rather, it was disproportionately the work of one man"". I thought crowdfunds were big group efforts of people contributing money for a project they know the details of beforehand? Of course, it was only 10% of the investment money according to the article. Where did the other $450,000 go? Moreso, when people were giving money to this crowdfund, how was it presented? Do you have a link explaining that? Really I think people are just trying to pin a lack of significant core innovation on the most public voice, but I don't have a link for that. Just my opinion.

Also this: ""In March, Green filled out the paperwork to register Moolah as a proper U.K. company"" seems to mean very clearly that ATM's weren't around the corner. He was just beginning to fill out paperwork in March, so clearly any claims of having ATM's in March had to premature. For something like ATM's, you'd definitely need to be registered. Maybe he was just trying to match the energy and hype of the dogecoin community, and it was so overbearing that he felt pressured into saying everything will be done tomorrow. This is a typical response of pretty much anyone who is still fresh into engineering, and as he had only started his efforts three months before I would say he was still pretty fresh to engineering.

I do have to say that the fascination with the guy seems to be intense. Why is that, is he a core developer? He seems like just a third party that's just really excited about dogecoin, why's he getting so much attention?

Anyways, thanks for the article. The fundamental offerings of his services still stand as valid and extremely valuable additions though. Monero ATM's would be a significant innovation, as well as another exchange/wallet thing. One thing I would not let the guy have control over is a community's PR, he seems to be not a good fit for that based on just this article. If one were to get him on a team, rather than acting alone and so aggressively (getting them to discuss things more privately specifically), he might bring some seriously positive elements to the table. I'll do some more reading on him though.

I don't think this same hype is typical of the community supporting Monero, so I would have to think that his style wouldn't be overbearing as it clearly was with Doge. Clearly, the general atmosphere that he became a part of (and influenced) allowed things to get carried away very rapidly. Wasting money on non-core projects (or one's that aren't required for survival) is completely the opposite of what I'd expect here.

There's lines in that article that make me just wat though: ""Moolah's confused timeline extended to its registration with regulatory bodies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a U.S. government division devoted to tracking financial information like money laundering""
Clearly someone went out of their way to word this in a negative light here. Overall the article's pretty biased, and it seems motivated rather than taking a bipartisan stance.

Come on, how can I actually hope to see the full picture when there's lines like this: ""...repeatedly asking for more transparency from Moolah and Green, who vapes almost constantly, threatening to sue him for harassment."" Really? vaping? Better call the EPA! Someone better hide the children from this monster!

I dunno, it seems like the innovation he was trying to provide was crushed under the hype of the coin itself to me. He was both a victim and aggressor in that scenario. I mean if you're looking for a comparison, people were irrationally blaming Claymore for the price of Monero dropping even though he was taking in less than 3% of the daily volume on Poloniex.

Darkcoin definitely has the momentum advantage.  Since I got in shortly after they both came on the scene, XMR is down 75% and DRK is up 500%.

Personally, I think Darkcoin will take over the illicit elements of Bitcoin in the near term as Bitcoin becomes more ""legitimate"".  Eventually, we will see another massive bitcoin bubble, and the powers that be will take note of and crack down on Darkcoin.  People running Masternodes in the US and extraditable countries will be fucked and the price of Darkcoin will tank.

It isn't about the blockchain - you can always simply work off the top block in Bitcoin, Monero or anything else. Rather, it's about the utxoset, i.e. the set of unspent outputs.

In Bitcoin (and Darkcoin and etc.) a spend is always obvious and uniquely identifiable because of the signature. In Monero, you can never know if an output has been spent *precisely because it has true anonymity*. Therefore the set of possibly unspent outputs grows in time. The way around this is to use another data structure, e.g. a hash tree of that set and of the set of unspent key images. This has been discussed in our dev channel, but obviously Monero has more primitive infrastructure needs to sort out at this moment.

I can't comment on Darkcoin's 'untraceability' when it still has no code open sourced. Regardless, the masternode method itself will always be vulnerable to malicious nodes. I find it a bit funny that anyone thinks that imposing a token cost to obtaining a node is a serious barrier for capable institutions.

At a more base level, it doesn't actually do anything you couldn't do yourself in Bitcoin by sending to multiple mixers and hoping at least one isn't corrupt. This makes the whole endeavor questionable considering any real user would want to stick to Bitcoin for obvious reasons.

No, actually I don't think you do. We've already had a successful spam attack that caused us to expend an inordinate amount of time and effort developing a better fee model.

&gt; If there is no usable product out there, people loose interest and switch to other, less developed but usable alternatives

Doesn't stop us from continuing to develop. We're trying to build a mature technology, not satiate people's desire for trading profits. If Monero only ""comes into its own"" in 3 years time that's entirely fine by us.

I would simply adopt a wait and see attitude with Monero.  Even though Monero embodies some great ideas we all know that great ideas (thanks to the Cryptonote people) sometimes fail miserably.  It takes a lot of work to make a cryptocurrency successful aside from bitcoin (bitcoin has enjoyed a lot of growth simply because it was first on the block) .  Monero has a long way to go before it even begins to mature and it does have some thorny issues that are yet to be worked out (especially if it becomes fairly popular).  It is really akin to an infant with all that entails.

So I would keep expectations fairly low and if you really want to use it effectively, maybe get a 64 bit OS.  (I mean, come on, no 64 bit OS?)

Remember, all this cryptocurrency stuff is VERY experimental, especially in the context of finance.

1) Put the blockchain.dat into the right place (the /AppData/Roaming/bitmonero folder) then run the .bat file to generate an address. Then you can either wait for the daemon to synchronize, or you can just quit the wallet and daemon with the command 'exit'. 

NOTE: It is important that you always close the daemon with the 'exit' command, otherwise it doesn't save any updates to the blockchain and you need to let it synchronise again.

2) **Write down the 24-word seed that you're given.** Keep it somewhere safe (not online because if someone gets this they can empty out your wallet). This is what you need to restore your wallet if your PC ever breaks or anything. You don't need your password to restore a wallet from seed, which is good if you forget your password but bad if someone else gets your seed.

3) Copy the wallet.bin, wallet.bin.keys, wallet.bin.address.txt to the simpleminer folder. Rename them to get rid of the .bin so you have the following files: wallet, wallet.keys and wallet.address.txt. You can also back up the wallet.bin.keys file, as you can use that to restore your Monero wallet (as long as you remember the password for it).

4) You can now launch simpleminer, put in your pool address and start mining. It should display the address you generated in step 1). Note that some antivirus software will flag the minerd.exe file in simpleminer as a virus because nefarious botnet owners have been using it to mine on other peoples computers, but it is actually totally safe.

5) To check your wallet balance, run the .bat from step 1), input your password into your wallet, and (once the daemon has synchronised and you are getting green text in that window), type 'refresh' into your wallet. This will scan through the blockchain and show you your balance.

A little history - I remember coming across bitcoin in 2010 - 2011 or so. Thought ""huh, thats interesting"" Could kick myself for not buying an asic during the first wave. After the price skyrocketed, I kinda lost interest - the valuation didn't make sense, and I assumed there were forces influencing it that just weren't trustworthy. 

Ultimately, I believe in the concepts behind cryptocurrency: decentralized money under no authorities control except those that use it. I think ASICS are a downward slope towards decentralization, hence my like of moneros algorithm. POS doesn't make sense to me regarding decentralization. 

Cryptocurrency creates something that civilization needs for stability - an artificially created force of nature that we can use to transfer and store value. Cryptocurrencies are just that. A store of value capable of uniting the planet. Borderless currency dissolves borders. With no borders..... you know where im goin. 

The privacy component is not #1 on my list of why I chose monero to be the cryptocurrency I obsess about - it was the decentralized nature of the whole thing, all the way down to the downright labyrinthine collection of documentation required to get the goddamned thing to work if you have no idea how to use linux. It was a challenge - a puzzle.

I do not believe that inference to be valid. Allowing the use of proper single-purpose addresses in no way forces all Monero transactions to be used for illicit purposes. Neither does the use of single-purpose addresses imply that something sinister is going on.

I am not advocating for Monero to be used for evil. I simply would prefer it to be a tool that can be used to gain as much privacy as reasonably possible.

In an ideal world, the payment ID addresses would be ""hardened"" somehow so they can't be picked apart.

The Red Cross can publish a regular Monero address. If single-purpose addresses happen to double as payment ID addresses, merchants will want to use those. People can hand out regular Monero addresses to relatives and acquaintances. The type of address shouldn't allow any kind of inference whether a transaction is evil or good.

In any case, let me give you one completely innocuous example for why I would like to be able to generate addresses more easily. I use different nicknames and email addresses for each website that requires me to register, such as various forums etc. Password managers allow this kind of thing to be done without becoming too painful. If I go and hand out the same address everywhere, my separated identities are suddenly tied together. Making a new wallet/account for each website is a lot more work than adding one more entry to a password manager.

Of course, not everything has worked out for either coin. LTC has trouble justifying its existence and use while PPC has to deal with centralized checkpointing and hoarding. There are no direct parallels, but this can help non-technical people get a sense of the difference.

I do not believe that inference to be valid. Allowing the use of proper single-purpose addresses in no way forces all Monero transactions to be used for illicit purposes. Neither does the use of single-purpose addresses imply that something sinister is going on.

I am not advocating for Monero to be used for evil. I simply would prefer it to be a tool that can be used to gain as much privacy as reasonably possible.

In an ideal world, the payment ID addresses would be ""hardened"" somehow so they can't be picked apart.

The Red Cross can publish a regular Monero address. If single-purpose addresses happen to double as payment ID addresses, merchants will want to use those. People can hand out regular Monero addresses to relatives and acquaintances. The type of address shouldn't allow any kind of inference whether a transaction is evil or good.

In any case, let me give you one completely innocuous example for why I would like to be able to generate addresses more easily. I use different nicknames and email addresses for each website that requires me to register, such as various forums etc. Password managers allow this kind of thing to be done without becoming too painful. If I go and hand out the same address everywhere, my separated identities are suddenly tied together. Making a new wallet/account for each website is a lot more work than adding one more entry to a password manager.

If you want to play around with bitmonerod and simplewallet, do so, but if you're not comfortable with command line interfaces, you are probably better off trusting Poloniex for now for actual storage of coin.

I always glossed over the concept that cryptocurrencies are a ""ledger"" - being that I have never used a ledger. As such, the key for me to understand how the blockchain actually works is that ledgers are always ""written to""... a concept that was apparently odd for me, I assume due to generational effects of never balancing a checkbook (computers have always done it for me) and always working with digital file storage, in which, for the most part, you can rewrite anything or delete anything etc. 

So there is no ""debit"" that occurs.... you just own a particular bunch of lines on the ledger. Furthermore, there are no ""tokens"" as I originally imagined them.

Lets assume you just joined Monero, and your name is Bob, - you made a new address, and someone sent you 12 monero, and you've been lucky mining, so you've got 5 monero from mining. On the ledger, there's a line that says ""Bob owns 12 monero!"" on block 500. And some other lines associated with your mining rewards, which probably came in tiny bits, so there are 5 lines of ""Bob owns 1 monero!"" in blocks 501 - 506

So when the wallet software scans the blockchain, it sees all these lines and adds them up to tell you ""You have 17 monero""

Now, if you want to go and send Alice 5 monero, this is NOT what happens, and is what I thought happened until I finally had it explained enough to get it - 

The protocol/wallet/blackbox/whatever subtracts 5 monero from your total account, and adds 5 monero to Alice's account. 

Instead, what actually happens is the protocol/wallet/blackbox scans the blockchain, looking for your lines. It finds the line ""bob has 12 monero"" and the 5 lines of ""bob owns 1 monero"". Based on a variety of factors (especially for monero with mixins etc), the wallet software will go ""I'm going to use these lines for this transaction"". For the sake of simplicity, lets just say it uses the ""Bob has 12 monero"" line.

So in a new line in the ledger, a new line is written that essentially means ""We're going to use that line up there that says 'Bob has 12 Monero'. We're then going to make a new line that says ""Bob has 7 monero"" and also make a new line that says ""Alice has 5 monero"". 

So now when the wallet software scans the blockchain (after this transaction has been accepted by the network), it will still see the original ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line, but then it will see the new transaction that occured that used that line, so it no longer counts it in the total. That line has been ""used up"", or in blockchain talk, turned into an input. 

But its important to realize that the ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line gets turned into an input by the new transaction. In reality (in the database, the blockchain), the line in block 500 still exists that says ""bob has 12 monero!"". But the new line in block 510 essentially says ""That line in block 500 should be ignored, and these new lines should be used instead - the ones that say Bob has 7 Monero and Alice has 5 Monero"".

For instance, if a miner could purchase equipment upgrades in XMR, pay his electricity in XMR, and pay his rent in XMR, that's his costs covered. Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system. With fiat and BTC settlement bridges (ie. that have eventual settlement, not instant settlement) this can happen without the parties even knowing or caring what happens, and it can happen without affecting the price much - or at all.

Ultimately the aim is to create something useful and usable that is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. That is not to dissuade speculators entirely, but they will have to get in at the sub-$50 mark if they want to see speculative growth.

Truth is we are not trying to merely create a GUI, as in a GUI wrapper. Fact is these simple wrappers already exist (Neozaru, Jojatekok and jwinterm's and we could probably use Bitcoin wallet, like Pebblecoin does).

What we are trying to build is **scalable** GUI software. And *scalable* is the hard part, not *GUI*.

## What is scalable?

* Mnemonic seed for increased security ([why](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/isnt-mnemonic-seed-and-inability-change-words-security-holes)).
* Low RAM footprint (""the DB"", presently [Symas Lightning MDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) but later a lot others, since we built a database API).
* e-commerce prerequisites, notably for payment processors.
* Low bandwith footprint (a framework for SPV, like Electrum). The [remote node](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/how-use-remote-node) provides a similar experience in that one doesn't have to download the whole blockchain, but this is where the similarities end and SPV would be lighter than a remote node.
- Much better understood (thus secure) and refactored code. This is behind-the-scene stuff and not sexy, but when it comes to securing your money, this matters. The Monero Protocol is sound, but we are not that comfortable with the source code we inherited in April (and improved since then). Note: we are pretty demanding on security, so when I say that ""we are not that comfortable"", this means the security is already high, just not high enough :)
- Gitian binaries
- Various mainstream users niceties, such as an address book, an easy way to do bookeeping (including easily report to tax offices, because Monero is not meant just for l33t haX0r, but for everyone, including legal persons like corporations, NGO, political parties...)
- Viewkey for optional transparency (see fluffy quote on Three Pilllars)
- Have a solid foundation for easy improvements later on (like third-parties improvements). Because once the (scalable) GUI wallet will be there, we expect things to accelerate - and we rather be ready for the acceleration. Fasten your seatbelt, Dorothy. 

## Why is scalable important?

Because it is one of the three pillars :)

More seriously, because once the official GUI wallet will be there, visibility will increase a lot. Which means more users who know nothing about Monero and later not even about cryptocurrencies. These people won't give a second thought. One does only one first impression. It *must* be the right one. Hence the necessity for a wallet than can handle the load. Be scalable, not that much on a technical standpoint than on a, say, ""political"" standpoint.

There are two aspects to this. At the moment, when you create a new wallet it generates two keys: your ""spend"" key and your ""view"" key. Now because this is unfinished software, the ""view"" key is shown once on creation and never again (we're fixing that:)

The view key (public key) is attached to transactions and would allow someone to view transactions you have made. The tooling will exist soon that will allow you to publish your public key and will allow someone else to use it on monerochain.info or other blockchain explorers and see all of your transactions and your balance. Moreover, we will add tooling that will allow you to publish the 1-time key *for a specific transaction*, thus allowing confirmation of the specifics of that transaction by an exchange or other party.

All of this is possible for any transactions that have already been made, so it's not like we have to make breaking changes to the code or hard-fork to support this, but we do need to add tooling so you can extract the relevant info from simplewallet (and other wallet tools) and then provide RPC calls and other information so the blockchain explorers can add tooling to view this information:)",,4,xmr,t1_ci1dhk1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I always glossed over the concept that cryptocurrencies are a ""ledger"" - being that I have never used a ledger. As such, the key for me to understand how the blockchain actually works is that ledgers are always ""written to""... a concept that was apparently odd for me, I assume due to generational effects of never balancing a checkbook (computers have always done it for me) and always working with digital file storage, in which, for the most part, you can rewrite anything or delete anything etc. 

So there is no ""debit"" that occurs.... you just own a particular bunch of lines on the ledger. Furthermore, there are no ""tokens"" as I originally imagined them.

Lets assume you just joined Monero, and your name is Bob, - you made a new address, and someone sent you 12 monero, and you've been lucky mining, so you've got 5 monero from mining. On the ledger, there's a line that says ""Bob owns 12 monero!"" on block 500. And some other lines associated with your mining rewards, which probably came in tiny bits, so there are 5 lines of ""Bob owns 1 monero!"" in blocks 501 - 506

So when the wallet software scans the blockchain, it sees all these lines and adds them up to tell you ""You have 17 monero""

Now, if you want to go and send Alice 5 monero, this is NOT what happens, and is what I thought happened until I finally had it explained enough to get it - 

The protocol/wallet/blackbox/whatever subtracts 5 monero from your total account, and adds 5 monero to Alice's account. 

Instead, what actually happens is the protocol/wallet/blackbox scans the blockchain, looking for your lines. It finds the line ""bob has 12 monero"" and the 5 lines of ""bob owns 1 monero"". Based on a variety of factors (especially for monero with mixins etc), the wallet software will go ""I'm going to use these lines for this transaction"". For the sake of simplicity, lets just say it uses the ""Bob has 12 monero"" line.

So in a new line in the ledger, a new line is written that essentially means ""We're going to use that line up there that says 'Bob has 12 Monero'. We're then going to make a new line that says ""Bob has 7 monero"" and also make a new line that says ""Alice has 5 monero"". 

So now when the wallet software scans the blockchain (after this transaction has been accepted by the network), it will still see the original ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line, but then it will see the new transaction that occured that used that line, so it no longer counts it in the total. That line has been ""used up"", or in blockchain talk, turned into an input. 

But its important to realize that the ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line gets turned into an input by the new transaction. In reality (in the database, the blockchain), the line in block 500 still exists that says ""bob has 12 monero!"". But the new line in block 510 essentially says ""That line in block 500 should be ignored, and these new lines should be used instead - the ones that say Bob has 7 Monero and Alice has 5 Monero"".

Well, thats my attempt at explaining outputs and inputs. How'd I do?",,3,,t1_crmqp82,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Like any new technology, I understand the first of any kind is likely an alpha test. A new concept will go through all of the rigorous tests that society can throw at it, from practicality, ease of use, exploitability, manipulation, spoofing/knock-off and general acceptance. Being that Bitcoin is a ‘currency’ and also acts as a ‘stock’, I figured that it was subject to the whims of the global market, making it even more susceptible to long-term failure or obsolescence. From early implementation, I was concerned that large investors or organizations with access to large computing infrastructure would corner the market or ramp up the difficulty. I watched small investors purchase GPU mining equipment, invest in ASICS and then cloud mining until the difficulty was hardly worth the effort. We then saw companies go bankrupt, investors lose their money and scammers cash out. When Litecoin and Altcoins in general started to appear, I believed the second phase of Bitcoin was starting and eventually markets would start shifting towards other coins that were still small-scale minable. I still didn’t see any noticeable traits that made Altcoins stand apart from Bitcoins, they were just clones with minor changes to the mining process, but overall they were all macro-minable. The same problem was still apparent; centralization was still possible. I have been waiting for a solid ASIC-hard coin, with privacy features and a non-Meme-Joke/immature image to invest in. I personally believe that decentralization, privacy, ease-of-use, professional brand and a dedicated DevTeam are the key features needed for a long-term successful coin. Most of the other coins with these traits were all deemed as scam-coins or were pre-mined. I have been waiting for a CPU coin that has all of the previously mentioned features without the flaws and that is actively working towards making it easier for the commoner to participate in the market. So far, Monero is number 1 on my list with all of these traits and current promises of continued development for the traits I believe that will make a coin successful in the long-term. While most Bitcoin investors believe that as difficulty becomes out of reach for most people, the price will go up; I personally believe that people will start pulling their money from Bitcoin and investing in something that continues to create currency over a long-term. Scarcity alone doesn’t create demand. Activity and perceived value creates demand. Scarcity is only valued when alternative options are not present. Cryptocurrency clearly will always have more options, therefore believing that scarcity will perpetually drive up demand is a joke. The only reason it’s still dominant is because of it’s level of acceptance. When another coin can achieve the same acceptance, Bitcoin will have nothing left working for it other than it’s PR tenure, which is also due to expire when a better solution arises. 

tl;dr Monero didn’t find me, I found Monero. True decentralization is the key to successful long-term open source currency.

I pointed out that this is a non-issue because the outputs are all denominated by decimal value (e.g. 12.34 = 10 + 2 + 0.3 + 0.04) so there are always a huge number of matching outputs.

Anonymint correctly pointed that this increases the blockchain size (more outputs in a tx). A technically illiterate forum member by the name of AlexGR used this to FUD Monero because he's a big investor in Darkcoin (DRK). It didn't occur to this guy that DRK also uses a denomination scheme and bloats the blockchain relative to Bitcoin. :)

At this point in time, DRK had a bit of a problem because it still had nothing to show and it's simple CoinJoin would be on obsolete on arrival anyway. The developer Evan Duffield declared that he would implement ring signatures in ""version 2"".

A few days later he realized he's out of his depth and has no chance (he's a coder, not a cryptographer). But he had to save face so he announced he's going to stick with CoinJoin because the new cryptography is unsafe and it bloats the chain. So begins the misguided FUD.

A literate user of course realizes that it doesn't actually matter that XMR, DRK, Zerocoin or anything else has a larger chain (unless it was bigger by a factor of several hundred or more, far outpacing memory growth).

Single POW means all the miners mine one algorithm that feeds the blockchain.

Multi POW means every miner can choose between one of several algorithms he wants to mine on. For example Asic owners can mine SHA, GPU miners can mine Scrypt or Skein, people with high electricity costs can mine an algorithm like Groestl or Qubit which effectively uses up to 50% less power.

It also increases the security of the network. Where single POW coins are vulnerable to 51% takeovers, an attacker on the Myriad chain would need 81% of any single algorithm, or 20% or at least 3 algorithms combined.

Of course, not everything has worked out for either coin. LTC has trouble justifying its existence and use while PPC has to deal with centralized checkpointing and hoarding. There are no direct parallels, but this can help non-technical people get a sense of the difference.

1. As a side note, the bloat being produced with the very low fees from before was not a malicious attack, but rather pools being a bit overly-zealous in payout frequency.  This caused a lot of ""dust"" to be created, and consequently a lot of blockchain bloat from the transactions therein.  
Another defense mechanism against bloat is that the soft cap on block size increases rather slowly.  Should the blockchain start to increase in size rapidly again we could coordinate with pool operators and miners to increase minimum fees again.  This is not ideal, as someone could theoretically execute a bloat attack to raise fees (and therefore make monero slightly less appealing by causing ordinary users to have higher fees), but to do so would, to my knowledge, be prohibitively expensive.  
This is a very interesting topic however, and rest assured that we do discuss these sort of things quite often.

2. I would absolutely love to give a timetable on the database implementation, but it's surprisingly non-trivial.  In the end it might appear to be trivial, but a large part of the task has been acquiring a rather complete understanding of the current blockchain implementation which is ~2k lines of incumbent code.

Legally speaking as the ""anonymity"" is at protocol level and Monero has view keys to allow regulatory compliance it will be treated much colder than Bitcoin but theres nothing they can do to ban unless they make encryption itself like HTTPS and stuff illegal.

Bitcoin resolved its undesired fork by eventual consensus -- even though the ""inner cabal"" chose the fork, the code didn't need to be changed (the cabal-chosen branch simply wound up being longest).

&gt; ""True privacy"" - that's cute. It certainly has better obfuscation, but obfuscation is not perfect privacy - it simply makes it much more difficult to de-obfuscate.
   
Let me rephrase: the best anonymity that can be found in the cryptocoins world! I personally disagree with the word ""obfuscation"". Obfuscation means something like coinjoin to me. With ring signatures, it's just maths that make it foundamentally intracable, not just a big noise to obfuscate the signal. There is mathematically no way to know which of the N inputs is the actual sender, at the single transaction level.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt;  One of very few coins to compliment bitcoin rather than compete.   

&gt; What does this even mean?   
   
""compliment"" is meant to be ""complement"". Didn't catch this, not a native speaker sorry.   
That means most altcoins claim to be better than bitcoin. The hype
around them is all about this, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not.
Take the most valued one by far, litecoin: it is all about ""having
faster block confirmation"", and ""resistant to asic"" (later rephrased
in better CPU/GPU/ASIC ratio, when the original statement was not true
anymore). The claim is just to do better than bitcoin, nothing
less. Which is ridiculous, with such negligeable changes nobody's
going to overcome bitcoin network effect and this is crystal clear
since years.  The cryptonote tech is not something better than
bitcoin, it is just *completely* different. Use bitcoin if you want
full transparency, use a cryptonote coin if you want full privacy.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Impossible to examine block chain for tracking funds.

&gt; There is a big difference between ""extremely difficult"" and ""impossible""

I'm not going to arg on that, you're right in theory. Let me rephrase
it so it is not ambiguous: cryptonote coins are by *very* far the most
difficult to track. I say *very*, because it happens at the math
level, not by just mixing as it was done previously (cf DRK). ""by far""
measures a conceptual gap here.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious candidate for crypto version of ""Swiss account""

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious contender for crypto with cash equivalence for privacy.

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right again!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Devs focusing on foundations not bling.

&gt; What does this mean?

They focus on fundamental things rather than bling-bling that would
make the coin looks more shiny in the eyes of the masses on short-term. Sounds
pretty rational, but it's not what is done by altcoin devs 99% of
the time. 

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Major interest from BTC ""hero"" members and BTC whales.

&gt; Sure, because they are looking to diversify their holdings. Don't
put all your eggs in one basket.

Well yes, but you evade the point here. The point is this: why on
Monero and not another alt? For many of them this is the first alt in
which they invest with a long-term perspective, or even the first in
which they invest at all.  The volume on exchanges is consistantly
puzzling for such a completely new coin based on a little known tech.
For many btc early adopters, they say it publicly, there is only one precedent to
the potential of Monero: that of bitcoin itself.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Cpu/gpu friendly. / Robust asic resistance.

&gt; On supposed ""ASIC resistance"" as a feature: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf

Fair point.

&amp;nbsp;   


&gt;&gt; Current state inflationary but coin holds value.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising difficulty.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising hash rate.  
&gt;&gt; Relatively equitable distribution.  
&gt;&gt; Low hype.  
&gt;&gt; High signal to noise community here.  
&gt;&gt; No evidence of any pump/dump.  

&gt; Fluff, and subject to change due to any number of variables.

I disagree, this is not all fluff. Having a low-hype/smart/long-term
oriented community is *very* healthy. Of course it is subject to
change, nobody can talk for the future, but sooooo many new coins
already fail here.   
I really do mean ""healthy"". Consider that it boils down to
having people really trusting and betting on this on a long-term perspective. 
These people will actually *build* stuff, rather than just
trading the high and low before switching to another coin.   
Again, many see only one precedent to this: bitcoin.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Future fundamental plusses:  
&gt;&gt; Gui imminent.  
&gt;&gt; Database overhaul underway.  
&gt;&gt; Website overhaul underway.

The strength with which the connection is made is different. If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system.

I am a fan of monero, and I hold lots of cryptocoins - but $20k is a serious investment for anyone. I recognize that you're doing dd and I appreciate that, but the thing that concerns me is your long-term vision. 

* First, you haven't missed the boat on bitcoin by any stretch. It kills me when I hear people say that. There are about 2 million bitcoin holders in the world out of a world population of 8 billion. If bitcoin is successful in the longterm it will appreciate steeply in value from its current position - so you haven't missed the boat. At this moment I would still invest 95% of any new capital into bitcoin. My personal technique is to play with the other coins to keep me distracted from trading/spending/losing bitcoin.

* Second, I do think Monero is a neat concept, but at this point is simply that - a concept coin. I'm buying a few and hoping it does something but the truth is that concept coins are released very frequently and I would guess that &lt;1% ever do anything with their concept. They look exciting and they're all going to change the word - but I haven't seen much of that yet. Darkcoin is notable because it has taken code-based steps to increase anonymity, but Monero is really just a clone of Bytecoin at this moment. (Yes, I'm still hopeful and expectant for it.) If you hang out six weeks you'll see other coins that grab your attention and look VERY exciting for a few weeks only to see the pump and dump cycle leave them worthless in the end.

* Third, there will be others! Cryptocurrency is a rapidly evolving space. So rapid that none of us has any real concept what it will look like in 9 months. Nine months ago we were all interested in ""crapcoins"" - direct clones of bitcoin that offered no substantial change except a change in branding and a new philosophy. We ARE seeing the first iteration of 2.0 coins now, but I don't even consider Monero a 2.0 coin. I define 2.0 coins (at this moment) as coins that have the programming infrastructure to manage DAO's.

A simple subpoena reveals what he earned, how he earned it, and when he bought that pregnancy test because the girl he’s sleeping with was worried. His government can and will give his savings a haircut for no apparent reason. And without any cause, his bank may deem it necessary to shut his account, complaining loudly that he is too “high risk” for them to service.

&gt; Today we say no more. No more shall the courts of the land cajole or force us into revealing the most intimate details of our finances.

&gt; The solution to this special case is a transaction split for the denominated values so that Intersect(ST^i, ...) is empty. In the bigger picture, O^1 ... O^7 then look just as if they were mixins used by someone else but end up in separate transactions. Spreading over blocks reduces circumstantial association.

After mulling over this for a bit, I'm not sure it is enough. Using a probabilistic model, an attacker could still infer that transactions within a relatively short time interval, which include inputs from the same transaction, are related with a high probability. That is, the chance of having n inputs from the same transaction within m blocks of each other would have a probability of roughly around:

(m * (average mixin factor) * (average transactions per block) / (transactions in blockchain))^n

Now, I don't have the numbers to run that calculation handy, but I believe that an attacker could quickly reach a high confidence, especially if the transactions are not only in nearby blocks, but also have identical mixin and similar denominations.

Edit: I think there may be something wrong with my reasoning above, but I'm too tired to take care of it right now.

Adding  
a) multiple inputs from the same random transactions as mixins  
b) with a random chance (1%-10%?)  
c) once above a certain mixin factor, to avoid some active attacks  
would, in my opinion, provide a stronger defense while also preventing attackers from eliminating ""identified"" outputs from future ring signatures. Finding transactions that fit may be difficult though.

Alternatively, it should be possible to automatically slowly spread out outputs in a wallet over a sufficiently big time interval that the probability given above is high enough not to allow an attacker to infer anything about the transactions.

&gt; I would guess you need ~5-10 or so in practice

That sounds about right to me.

&gt; Over time a wallet builds up a set of input transactions to work from so this isn't needed.

I see some use cases, which seem somewhat common, were this is unlikely to happen though. For example, somebody who buys a big amount of Monero once, while it is cheap (e.g. now) and then holds, with occasional spends, wouldn't accumulate enough input transactions.",,1,,t1_ck5dymp,t5_31hbr,,1409522744,,,,,,,,,,,

that address made more than 30k XMR with cryptmonero.com pool, contributing roughly 2/3 hash rate of that pool and 2.5% of network hash rate (that's huge). Not sure if he has any other addresses and mining at other pools or not.

As a first stop, I'll reiterate [my post from Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.msg8246348#msg8246348) on creating a secure offline wallet:

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.
4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.
9. Write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed.
10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.
11. Switch off the computer, remove the battery if there is one, and leave it physically off for a few hours.

There you go - the wallet you've created was created in RAM, and the digital files are now lost forever. If some magical hacker manages to somehow get the data, they will lack the long password to open it. If you need to receive payments, you have the address, and you have the view key if needed. If you need access to it, you have your 24 word seed, and you can now write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever. Then write a bunch of extra love letters. That way, if your deposit box is ever discovered, it'll be disregarded as unimportant love letters.

**Creating a secure, online wallet**

Create a new wallet on your computer, using a reasonably secure password or passphrase, and write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed. You can transact using your wallet, knowing that if the wallet files are stolen it is extremely unlikely that an attacker will be able to brute-force your password (wallet files are quite heavily encrypted).

The same process of securing your 24 word seed as with the offline wallet applies: write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever. Then write a bunch of extra love letters. That way, if your deposit box is ever discovered, it'll be disregarded as unimportant love letters.",,4,xmr,t1_cjsuwe9,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

At the moment, when you create a new wallet it generates two keys: your ""spend"" key and your ""view"" key. Now because this is unfinished software, the ""view"" key is shown once on creation and never again (we're fixing that:)

The view key (public key) is attached to transactions and would allow someone to view transactions you have made. The tooling will exist soon that will allow you to publish your public key and will allow someone else to use it on monerochain.info or other blockchain explorers and see all of your transactions and your balance. Moreover, we will add tooling that will allow you to publish the 1-time key *for a specific transaction*, thus allowing confirmation of the specifics of that transaction by an exchange or other party.

All of this is possible for any transactions that have already been made, so it's not like we have to make breaking changes to the code or hard-fork to support this, but we do need to add tooling so you can extract the relevant info from simplewallet (and other wallet tools) and then provide RPC calls and other information so the blockchain explorers can add tooling to view this information:)",,2,xmr,t1_ci1d18b,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I started out with a basic Debian wheezy VM and installed Tor. Here's the `/etc/torrc`:

    VirtualAddrNetwork 192.198.0.0/10
    AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
    TransPort 9040

Set the nameserver in `/etc/resolv.conf`:

    nameserver 127.0.0.1

Use `chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf` to make sure nothing changes it. Next you need to run a bunch of iptables commands. (Look up the uid of the `debian-tor` user and adjust it. You will also want to adjust the 10.0.2.0/24 subnet if yours is different.) Use your preferred way of making sure the iptables commands are run at the appropriate time:

4. Ah yes, I vaguely remember that.

The bottom line is that Monero doesn't have a cushy premine / instamine to rely on for funding, and we don't have enough volunteers to handle things like cross-platform functional testing, release engineering, devops, continuous integration, and so on.

You are getting excellence in software development and architecture at a big fat cost of nothing, but we are only a handful of people scattered around the globe. If you want things to happen faster you have two options: wait for us to get to it, or do it yourself. If you choose to wait then you have the option of paying for it to go faster, else you have to abide by the timelines of a collective of unpaid, part-time volunteers who also have to work to make a living.",,4,xmr,t1_cr5cb0b,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Either download the OS X binaries from the link there, or follow the instructions for getting the source from github and building yourself. There should be two executable files that you run from Terminal, bitmonerod and simplewallet.

3. from Terminal, run bitmonerod, and wait until the blockchain is sync'd. This will take hours from scratch, or you can download an intermediate one (linux version, not windows)

4. create a new wallet in Terminal using simpleminer: ./simpleminer --generate-new-wallet=YOURWALLETNAME.bin. Close simpleminer using the command 'exit', and then reopen your wallet with the command ./simpleminer --wallet-file=YOURWALLETNAME.bin. This insures that you know your password.

I have never doubted that and never said I doubted it. Seriously, whatever's on the block chain, and whatever's sent in the protocol, has nothing to with my issue. Nor do I doubt your assertion that the wallet software doesn't keep a history of addresses it's sent money to.

All of my concerns are about leakage *outside of and around* the actual Monero software.

What I'm saying is that Alice is going to be leaky. She is going to make mistakes, and those mistakes are sometimes going to disclose the addresses she's paying to. Sometimes she'll make technical mistakes, and sometimes she'll just trust the wrong people or software. Alice will leak recipient addresses through pathways that are *not part of the wallet, not part of the block chain, and in no way under your control*. Sometimes Alice will even leak for actually rational reasons.

If you encourage Bob to make his address a unique identifier for him, or even for one of his lines of business, that makes Alice's leakiness a bigger risk for her (and probably for him, too).

You seem to be taking the position that Alice just shouldn't leak. But that's not how real users work in the real world. You have to do everything possible to *help* Alice not to leak... and then assume she will anyway, and try to minimize the impact of that.

&gt; Also let's be clear: *there is no practical way to enforce one-time address use on a protocol level*

Obviously not. But that doesn't mean that the way the wallet software works doesn't have an enormous impact on when and whether one-time addresses *actually get used*. Not only does it affect the relative convenience, but it affects the expectations that get built up, and sometimes locked in, in surrounding systems.

It also affects the profitability for attackers of developing tools and capabilities to exploit the address reuse case, and that matters in practice.

&gt; Having a third-party robosigning for you means that you trust that third-party implicitly with your data.

Um, that really depends on what you mean by ""my data"".

It's one thing to trust a third party with a unique ephemeral recipient address that will only ever be used in one transaction, knowing that it's relatively likely that the address really is ephemeral, because the whole surrounding system is built to make that the path of least resistance.

It's a different thing to trust a third party with what amounts to the True Name of the recipient.

There are gradations and variations, of course. For example, for this particular case, you could do something like a Bitcoin stealth address, and have Alice generate an address she *knew* was unique to hand to the third party. In that case, she could still leak the underlying stealth address, but she at least wouldn't be forced to give full information to the third party.

&gt;&gt; She uploads her contact to Google

&gt; If she's paying Bob privately and he's not using stealth payment IDs (see above) then it's the same as Alice having his email address (which, let's say, is totally_not_weird_bob@gmail.com). All of those connections to Bob can be made by her accidentally uploading the contact with his email.

Yes, it's true that any other publicly known identifier for Bob is equally dangerous.

But this is a good example of how reality intrudes, and how little details can make people change people's behavior to make them leak. Bob's email address isn't 96 characters of base64. Alice can memorize Bob's email address easily enough. Or she can obfuscate it in a way that she can reverse mentally. She can't do either with a Monero address, so she has more incentive to store it in a database somewhere (contacts or otherwise).

Furthermore, if she's not like you or me, Alice is less likely to subjectively *realize* that she needs to protect that address. She's got a very good chance of seeing Bob's email address as a name for Bob, and a significantly smaller chance of recognizing his Monero address as one.

I think it's much more likely that the cryptocurrency world will reach an equilibrium with several currency.

I can definitely imagine a world with bitcoin used as a store of value, monero for everyday payment and etherium for complex smartcontract.

I've put in bold the part that doesn't make sense.

Knowing Bob's address doesn't help them get a transaction history from Alice. Alice doesn't have a transaction history that includes the destination address, her transaction history merely includes the transactions. The only extra information Alice has in her wallet history, that isn't on a block explorer, is which of the transaction's outputs came back to her in the form of change.

Practically:

The Monero donation address is 46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em

My address is 49VNLa9K5ecJo13bwKYt5HCmA8GkgLwpyFjgGKG6qmp8dqoXww8TKPU2PJaLfAAtoZGgtHfJ1nYY8G2YaewycB4f72yFT6u

Here I am transferring 1 Monero to the donation address:

    [wallet 49VNLa]: transfer 3 46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em 1
    Money successfully sent, transaction &lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

And here's the transaction on a block explorer: http://chainradar.com/xmr/transaction/4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0

The 1 XMR output that went to the donation address is 9844d5f4d7ab22dab1dc1815578654c54115f19155ebc6995ab2569718f0905c, and that bears no relation to the actual address.

Thus knowing both the addresses has no value, no matter how big your database of addresses is.

Similarly, in my wallet this is all I can see for that transaction:

    [wallet 49VNLa]: incoming_transfers
            amount       	spent	global index	                              tx id
    &lt;-- snip --&gt;
           0.030000000000	  F  	      195895	&lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

ie. all I can see are those two change outputs that came back to me.

And in the recipient wallet:

    [wallet 46BeWr]: incoming_transfers
            amount       	spent	global index	                              tx id
    &lt;-- snip --&gt;
           1.000000000000	  F  	      545645	&lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

Even if you had all of the addresses of every Monero user it wouldn't be enough. *You need more information*.

&gt; Every time she makes a payment, she has to tell that service provider who she's paying

Having a third-party robosigning for you means that you trust that third-party implicitly with your data. It's unlikely to be tenable if the third-party is the sort that will resell your data, but for some people they're willing to compromise their privacy for convenience, so your point is taken.

We cannot stop people from publishing their transaction history on the Internet, but as you can see in my practical example earlier it isn't much use.

Obviously if Alice wants to publicly state that she paid Bob 10 XMR and is able to reveal the public keys for that transaction's inputs (which can be hashed and compared against the key images) then that's her prerogative, but it doesn't reveal any of Bob's other transactions (both received or sent).

&gt; She buys a ticket to another town using Monero

This won't exist in future once we've completed our work on stealth payment IDs (see the research goals here: https://getmonero.org/design-goals/), as any automated service would (by definition) require the payment to have a payment ID. The ""address"" on the clipboard would include a serialised payment ID, so her boyfriend would need to be adept enough to manually unpack and deserialise the address, repack it into an address without a payment ID, and then the train company needs to have published their address somewhere at some stage (unlikely if they only start using Monero from when stealth payment IDs are complete).

&gt; She uploads her contact to Google

If she's paying Bob privately and he's not using stealth payment IDs (see above) then it's the same as Alice having his email address (which, let's say, is totally_not_weird_bob@gmail.com). All of those connections to Bob can be made by her accidentally uploading the contact with his email.

Also let's be clear: *there is no practical way to enforce one-time address use on a protocol level*, as nodes can never tell what the destination address of an output is. It doesn't matter what we do on the client side, people are going to reuse addresses (just like they do with Bitcoin) because it's convenient and people tend to do dumb things regardless of who it hurts. Even if we *could* enforce it Alice would still need to contact Bob to get a payment address each time, so she'd have his number or email that would trip her up in the same way.",,3,xmr,t1_cqn8vx8,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Set the nameserver in `/etc/resolv.conf`:

Use `chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf` to make sure nothing changes it. Next you need to run a bunch of iptables commands. (Look up the uid of the `debian-tor` user and adjust it.

I know David Francois very well, and we've discussed the subject on occasion.

&gt; TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

I fully agree - but it *does* protect our users from being sniffed at a coffee shop, at their place of work, and even by most state-level actors.

&gt; I'm honestly struggling to use Monero. There's no PPA, no deb package, nothing.

I know, and those are extremely low on our list of priorities right now.

When he started ignoring the community's overwhelming desire not to make Monero a merge-mined coin we (the Core Team, current stewards of the project) forked it and sort of came together. The core team did not know each other really, and the takeover wasn't planned. Some of us peripherally knew other members of the core team, so our binding factor was ""right place, right time"" plus each of us not being completely, utterly retarded.

2. I think the viewkey functionality solves that problem entirely. Oppressive governments can demand their citizens hand over their viewkeys, more permissive governments can ask that they volunteer them for tax / regulation purposes. Neither of those governments can know if you have a private account or accounts (the privacy-leaking edge cases is what we're tightening up right now through things like i2p integration) so it really is ""private by default, optionally transparent"".
3. We have infinite supply (the block reward reduces to a minimum of 0.3 XMR in ~8 years and then stays at that value indefinitely) so late comers won't feel left out - it's a slightly inflationary cryptocurrency, not deflationary.
4. I think for something like Monero technical excellence will outstrip the competition. Anyone who knows about decentralised security software design and cryptography, and wants to get involved and contribute, would gravitate towards contributing to Monero rather than launch a competitor. Additionally, we're already diverging away from CryptoNote and will continue to do so quite dramatically (to fix their shortcomings and introduce new functionality), so a competitor would have to be forked from us.
5. Darknote is an outlier, I can't tell if they're part of the Bytecoin / CryptoNote scam, but they're certainly an interesting proposition if you want a currency that implements the CN protocol and won't veer away.

If you have 1.23 bitcoin (or 1.23 monero) that should actually be broken up into three UTXO's... a UTXO of 1.00, a UTXO of 0.2, and a UTXO of 0.03. And if you decide to send me 0.03 BTC, you actually send me the relevant UTXO. You broadcast a transaction on the network that will look something like ""I send  following UTXO to MathAndFerrets, this UTXO right here!"" and you sign this message/cheque with the private key responsible for the 0.03 BTC. 

Whenever a miner hears about that transaction, they will comb through the blockchain and verify that the 0.03BTC you are trying to send to me has not yet been sent away to anyone else, and, if it's cool, they will bundle it into a block of other transactions that are also legitimate. A UTXO is a bookkeeping/computer science concept.

Second, short answer, stealth addresses still shield everyone, but only to the extent that bitcoin does so. And, as you may have seen, bitcoin isn't technically anonymous, because circumstantial forensic analysis of the blockchain can reveal information about a transaction. In fact, data mining essentially removes all anonymity from bitcoin. Nail one drug dealer who uses bitcoin and you nail all clients of theirs, even if those clients were ""smart"" and used a coin mixer, because coin mixing is NOT cryptographic security, it's a shell game.

Third is the hardest question and most fun.  A UTXO (unspent transaction output) is technically what you own when you own XMR or bitcoin. Your private key is the key that allows you to transmit that transaction output to someone else; once you broadcast your transaction on the network, everyone makes sure that UTXO has not yet been spent, and once that is accomplished, the receiver will get a new UTXO. In bitcoin, the old UTXO's ... dissipate or are deleted, or at least can be forgotten after awhile. In Monero, not so.

When you start talking ring sigs, things get more complicated than the messages above. The message being broadcast becomes something like ""One of the UTXOs from the set {0.03 BTC owned by cqm, 0.03 BTC owned by warren buffet, 0.03 BTC owned by bruce wayne}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC1093073. Furthermore, the image of the key used to sign this message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah."" (Key images are usually just hashes of the original key)

Now, when a miner hears the message, they can't really comb through the blockchain looking for whether or not cqm really owns the UTXO of 0.03 BTC to send to me. That's what they would do with BTC, but they can't do it with monero. After all, it's not even clear which of these UTXO's is being sent - is it cqm's, or Bruce Wayne's, or Warren Buffets?  The miner has no idea which member of the set is sending, and only knows the receiving address, not the receiver. However, the miner CAN comb through the blockchain and look for previous usages of the key image H3107u3830830blahblahblah, it's a nice, easy thing to check. If it has been used before, that's a double-spend. Things get more information-intensive because every time YOU hear about a transaction, you will scramble to check if you can access address ABC to see if the money was sent to you.

Anyway, the number of possible-sending individuals OTHER than you is the number of mix-ins. A transaction with mix-in = 0 has no one else mixed in, and so no anonymity. It looks like this:

""One of the UTXOs from the set {this UTXO owned by cqm right here}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC. Furthermore, the image of the key I will use to sign the message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah"" and, of course, it's clear to everyone watching that cqm sent the money.

Finally, how do chain reactions work?

Well, if, all of a sudden, the UTXO's owned by Bruce Wayne and Warren Buffet are NO LONGER AVAILABLE because they have been spent NON-anonymously, then every ring signature created using those as obfuscating mix-ins are no longer really ring-sigs, they're just normal sigs. I mean, you can tell ... ""hey, this sig says bruce wayne coulda signed it, but bruce wayne doesn't own this money anymore... so he's out... and Warren Buffet sent this money to the Bahamas... so he's out... this musta been cqm.""

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

-- ""Bitcoin's recession..."" The price has recently risen with the xmr.to news, so maybe the plan of price being equal to utility is working.

-- ""lacks of interest in Monero..."" Don't know how to verify or dismiss this claim, so it remains in the claim's department.

-- ""Network hash rate is dominated by botnet..."" Again, don't know how to dismiss or verify this claim, so it remains in the claim's department.

""With current situation"" anything isn't over or undervalued, the market dictates what the market dictates and is only viewed as unfair by investors of Monero or detractors pumping their own coin or for critics who want an absence of cryptocurrency in the marketplace all together.

Edit of edit: AFAIK Monero was accepted as the #1 coin a few months back, but I haven't heard why it is still listed on the voting page or why it hasn't been listed on the exchange yet. I'm guessing the cryptonote code adds a layer of complexity to the situation and Cryptsy is waiting for an API--but this is admittedly conjecture on my part.

that address made more than 30k XMR with cryptmonero.com pool, contributing roughly 2/3 hash rate of that pool and 2.5% of network hash rate (that's huge). Not sure if he has any other addresses and mining at other pools or not.

This amount of XMR might cost an investor five figures in USD and this guy essentially got it for free. 

Edit: [Mining Monero with malware is not new](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=639375.0), this problem have been existed since very early days of coins. Yet we don't know how many percentage the botnets and malware are making up total network hash rate.

All people ? no not all of them. 2 kinds of people will not be happy that is government people and criminals.
They will try to use any and every method they can think of to see how much money you have and how much they can tax you or steal from you. 
When you go buy a new passport, they will force you to use bitcoin and then datamine your wallet adresses. 
Or this nice delivery guy where you have to pay at the door, will actually work for the criminals. 
Currently already some 60% of all bitcoins can be linked to an IP address. This is going to be much, much worse, due to daily use by a real person with a real house where he really lives and can really be arrested or extorted. People will want their old private paper notes back that they can privately hide under the bed.
Anonymity is important when it comes to money, very important. For this reason bitcoin eventually will decline in use and be replaced with a 
true anonymous currency. Like cash, as was promised.
Anonymity of currency will be good for this planet. Governments will be forced to get their funding from projects that really help the population. Tax will come from utilities. I envision toll roads where the left lane is free, but for the right lane, you pay a little tax. 
There will be no money left for them to buy bombs or bullets to support their old fiat system. 
Work will be rewarding again because the world is free now from the disease what we used to call banks that kill about everything that people have worked for. People will be truly free and prosperous and can choose to support a certain govt project or not. 
Countries will eventually disappear because we are all in the same boat now, economically. Terrorism will disappear because there are no more angry people when the world is finally forced to play fair and stop the currency war.
We are going to be a truly global population. Thank you Monero for making this possible. I am proud to be able to help with changing the world.

Monero's value will come from usefulness (utility), not from overall scarcity and some numbers fudged on a spreadsheet. When it has utility there will be a natural and gradual price increase, as demand will slightly outstrip supply due to ever-increasing utility (a Monero network effect).

But all of this will take time - maybe even several years to play out.

The truth is that scaling bitcoin (or any other blockchain) to a worldwide usage is likely impossible.
(the blockchain and bandwidth increase exponentially with the number of users)

I think it's much more likely that the cryptocurrency world will reach an equilibrium with several currency.

I can definitely imagine a world with bitcoin used as a store of value, monero for everyday payment and etherium for complex smartcontract.

But there is also a chance that if cryptocurrency usage get mainstream those three currency would not be able scale enough and maybe there will be a need for Litecoin or other altcoin without specific advantage other than having available bandwidth...

In my honest view, the only reason left to develop/continue developing on Bitcoin is so that it gives leeway for other cryptocurrencies to rise to prominence, given that Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. All those things that you said Bitcoin provides, is provided by 3rd parties, and are centralized.

I'm sorry, but Satoshi said it himself about how Bitcoin's core features will never change. Therefore Bitcoin will eventually die out, it's simply too ""stone-age"", and it is in no way, shape, or form, a currency(It entirely lacks fungibility, something even Credit Cards have).

I have stopped using Bitcoin entirely except for ""HODLING"", because it makes no sense to use it.

If you have 1.23 bitcoin (or 1.23 monero) that should actually be broken up into three UTXO's... a UTXO of 1.00, a UTXO of 0.2, and a UTXO of 0.03. And if you decide to send me 0.03 BTC, you actually send me the relevant UTXO. You broadcast a transaction on the network that will look something like ""I send  following UTXO to MathAndFerrets, this UTXO right here!"" and you sign this message/cheque with the private key responsible for the 0.03 BTC. 

Whenever a miner hears about that transaction, they will comb through the blockchain and verify that the 0.03BTC you are trying to send to me has not yet been sent away to anyone else, and, if it's cool, they will bundle it into a block of other transactions that are also legitimate. A UTXO is a bookkeeping/computer science concept.

Second, short answer, stealth addresses still shield everyone, but only to the extent that bitcoin does so. And, as you may have seen, bitcoin isn't technically anonymous, because circumstantial forensic analysis of the blockchain can reveal information about a transaction. In fact, data mining essentially removes all anonymity from bitcoin. Nail one drug dealer who uses bitcoin and you nail all clients of theirs, even if those clients were ""smart"" and used a coin mixer, because coin mixing is NOT cryptographic security, it's a shell game.

Third is the hardest question and most fun.  A UTXO (unspent transaction output) is technically what you own when you own XMR or bitcoin. Your private key is the key that allows you to transmit that transaction output to someone else; once you broadcast your transaction on the network, everyone makes sure that UTXO has not yet been spent, and once that is accomplished, the receiver will get a new UTXO. In bitcoin, the old UTXO's ... dissipate or are deleted, or at least can be forgotten after awhile. In Monero, not so.

When you start talking ring sigs, things get more complicated than the messages above. The message being broadcast becomes something like ""One of the UTXOs from the set {0.03 BTC owned by cqm, 0.03 BTC owned by warren buffet, 0.03 BTC owned by bruce wayne}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC1093073. Furthermore, the image of the key used to sign this message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah."" (Key images are usually just hashes of the original key)

Now, when a miner hears the message, they can't really comb through the blockchain looking for whether or not cqm really owns the UTXO of 0.03 BTC to send to me. That's what they would do with BTC, but they can't do it with monero. After all, it's not even clear which of these UTXO's is being sent - is it cqm's, or Bruce Wayne's, or Warren Buffets?  The miner has no idea which member of the set is sending, and only knows the receiving address, not the receiver. However, the miner CAN comb through the blockchain and look for previous usages of the key image H3107u3830830blahblahblah, it's a nice, easy thing to check. If it has been used before, that's a double-spend. Things get more information-intensive because every time YOU hear about a transaction, you will scramble to check if you can access address ABC to see if the money was sent to you.

Anyway, the number of possible-sending individuals OTHER than you is the number of mix-ins. A transaction with mix-in = 0 has no one else mixed in, and so no anonymity. It looks like this:

""One of the UTXOs from the set {this UTXO owned by cqm right here}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC. Furthermore, the image of the key I will use to sign the message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah"" and, of course, it's clear to everyone watching that cqm sent the money.

Finally, how do chain reactions work?

Well, if, all of a sudden, the UTXO's owned by Bruce Wayne and Warren Buffet are NO LONGER AVAILABLE because they have been spent NON-anonymously, then every ring signature created using those as obfuscating mix-ins are no longer really ring-sigs, they're just normal sigs. I mean, you can tell ... ""hey, this sig says bruce wayne coulda signed it, but bruce wayne doesn't own this money anymore... so he's out... and Warren Buffet sent this money to the Bahamas... so he's out... this musta been cqm.""

That's like saying a game developer playing games day and night is a good thing because his goal is to give users a ""perfect gaming experience"". (I hope I understood you right here.)

&gt; It's even evidence of willingness to give up ""geek fame"" in favor of more important things.

That's like saying making people work for free is better than paying people. Should Google hire people to work for free and anonymously so that they're doing the work for the joy and purpose of it and not for ""geek fame"" or ""money""?

&gt; Can you substantiate that in any way, or is it just how you feel? Can you even explain what ""responsible"" means in that context?

Well all of us are fallible. Excluding ""perfect"" coders which might be all Monero has, Monero might have fallible coders. Possibly a **bit** ""lazy"" too. There's nothing wrong with that. It's human nature. Lazy people can do things right if under a bit of pressure, if there is a bit of reputation in question. That's how things work.

&gt; So what's the difference?

It's a subjective thing. I think anyone would feel attached to a project with his real name on, than with a project where he is anonymous.
If someone had said ""Real Name"" has done awesome work, you will feel a lot better than ""anonymousninjawhocankickandhowl"" has done awesome work. The former would drive someone to get back to the project than the latter.

And yes, no one is ""obliged"" to do anything, but isn't it more ""legit"" sounding when people come out openly and do stuff?

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; It's even evidence of willingness to give up ""geek fame"" in favor of more important things.

That's like saying making people work for free is better than paying people. Should Google hire people to work for free and anonymously so that they're doing the work for the joy and purpose of it and not for ""geek fame"" or ""money""?

&gt; Can you substantiate that in any way, or is it just how you feel? Can you even explain what ""responsible"" means in that context?

Well all of us are fallible. Excluding ""perfect"" coders which might be all Monero has, Monero might have fallible coders. Possibly a **bit** ""lazy"" too. There's nothing wrong with that. It's human nature. Lazy people can do things right if under a bit of pressure, if there is a bit of reputation in question. That's how things work.

Thus far you've mentioned ""people"" who were mining it ""for a long time"". Not a single person who is a known entity (with a credible WoT reputation and known publicly within the cryptography and/or cryptocurrency community) has stepped forward to validate this claim. Given the number of people involved in both cryptocurrency and Tor/I2P related projects, the lack of public, known figures stepping forward to validate this claim is indicative of the claim being baseless and untrue.

This claim about it ""being used on a few services on the deep web"" also lacks any basis. A screenshot of this Library Unicorn service with one mention on the entire page doth-not-a-claim-validate. Again - were this true, the many, many known deepweb operators (many of whom are in the Bitcoin WoT) would be rushing forward to confirm that they've been accepting Bytecoin for years.

First off, it's easy to Sybil attack (by creating fake nodes), so there's a danger in that. Second problem is that you have to barely incentivise them, because if you over-incentivise then you create a Darkcoin-like scenario where there are perverse incentives (for nodes to attack each other to thin the herd, so to speak, and earn more).

There are two basic options: [Justus Ranvier's ""make everything a market"" idea](https://bitcoinism.liberty.me/2015/02/09/economic-fallacies-and-the-block-size-limit-part-2-price-discovery/) where you pay for timeliness of a node, or a scheme I came up with that smooth helped me work through that *may* be doable and somewhat simpler to implement / use. We also don't have payment channels in Monero, so Justus Ranvier's system may not be workable for us as yet.

Basically the idea I had was for nodes to be able to set a completely optional donation address. Miners will then have a default-on setting to donate all the tx fees they receive (since they aren't reliant on tx fees for profitability, as we have the minimum block reward thing) to a random node in the connection pool. The rules are that the node has to be 1. be in the whitelist, 2. have been seen in the last 24 hours, 3. have been connected to the miner node for more than 1 hour in those 24 hours.

Because it's completely optional nobody is forced into doing it, but because it's enabled by default the nodes that also have smart mining on (when that gets finished) will ensure that there are at least some miners donating. Also in order to add to this, and not make it difficult for people to cover their costs, we can traverse the network and have a running list of donation addresses that users can voluntarily donate to.

The advantage of this over something like Justus' approach is that we don't have to care about Sybil attacks, because the incentive is so small (cost-covering at best).

1) Put the blockchain.dat into the right place (the /AppData/Roaming/bitmonero folder) then run the .bat file to generate an address. Then you can either wait for the daemon to synchronize, or you can just quit the wallet and daemon with the command 'exit'. 

NOTE: It is important that you always close the daemon with the 'exit' command, otherwise it doesn't save any updates to the blockchain and you need to let it synchronise again.

2) **Write down the 24-word seed that you're given.** Keep it somewhere safe (not online because if someone gets this they can empty out your wallet). This is what you need to restore your wallet if your PC ever breaks or anything. You don't need your password to restore a wallet from seed, which is good if you forget your password but bad if someone else gets your seed.

3) Copy the wallet.bin, wallet.bin.keys, wallet.bin.address.txt to the simpleminer folder. Rename them to get rid of the .bin so you have the following files: wallet, wallet.keys and wallet.address.txt. You can also back up the wallet.bin.keys file, as you can use that to restore your Monero wallet (as long as you remember the password for it).

4) You can now launch simpleminer, put in your pool address and start mining. It should display the address you generated in step 1). Note that some antivirus software will flag the minerd.exe file in simpleminer as a virus because nefarious botnet owners have been using it to mine on other peoples computers, but it is actually totally safe.

5) To check your wallet balance, run the .bat from step 1), input your password into your wallet, and (once the daemon has synchronised and you are getting green text in that window), type 'refresh' into your wallet. This will scan through the blockchain and show you your balance.


I won't lie - Monero in it's current state is not the most user friendly of coins! But some big developments (including an easy-to-use GUI) are just around the corner which should make things a lot more straightforward than this.

Monero has a long way to go before it even begins to mature and it does have some thorny issues that are yet to be worked out (especially if it becomes fairly popular).  It is really akin to an infant with all that entails.

So I would keep expectations fairly low and if you really want to use it effectively, maybe get a 64 bit OS.  (I mean, come on, no 64 bit OS?)

I pointed out that this is a non-issue because the outputs are all denominated by decimal value (e.g. 12.34 = 10 + 2 + 0.3 + 0.04) so there are always a huge number of matching outputs.

Anonymint correctly pointed that this increases the blockchain size (more outputs in a tx). A technically illiterate forum member by the name of AlexGR used this to FUD Monero because he's a big investor in Darkcoin (DRK). It didn't occur to this guy that DRK also uses a denomination scheme and bloats the blockchain relative to Bitcoin. :)

At this point in time, DRK had a bit of a problem because it still had nothing to show and it's simple CoinJoin would be on obsolete on arrival anyway. The developer Evan Duffield declared that he would implement ring signatures in ""version 2"".

A few days later he realized he's out of his depth and has no chance (he's a coder, not a cryptographer). But he had to save face so he announced he's going to stick with CoinJoin because the new cryptography is unsafe and it bloats the chain. So begins the misguided FUD.

A literate user of course realizes that it doesn't actually matter that XMR, DRK, Zerocoin or anything else has a larger chain (unless it was bigger by a factor of several hundred or more, far outpacing memory growth).

3. We have infinite supply (the block reward reduces to a minimum of 0.3 XMR in ~8 years and then stays at that value indefinitely) so late comers won't feel left out - it's a slightly inflationary cryptocurrency, not deflationary.
4. I think for something like Monero technical excellence will outstrip the competition. Anyone who knows about decentralised security software design and cryptography, and wants to get involved and contribute, would gravitate towards contributing to Monero rather than launch a competitor. Additionally, we're already diverging away from CryptoNote and will continue to do so quite dramatically (to fix their shortcomings and introduce new functionality), so a competitor would have to be forked from us.
5. Darknote is an outlier, I can't tell if they're part of the Bytecoin / CryptoNote scam, but they're certainly an interesting proposition if you want a currency that implements the CN protocol and won't veer away.
6. Lack of funding coupled with impatience from a userbase whose only reference points are the (relatively) mature Bitcoin and a bunch of premined / ICO-funded ~~scams~~ altcoins; heretofore unknown issues in the Ed25519 curve or some core cryptography that we can't replace fast enough; general and overwhelming apathy towards privacy, where people are content with sacrificing all privacy as long as they get ""free"" stuff.",,13,xmr,t1_cr6jmel,t5_31hbr,moderator,1431467431,,,,,,,,,,,

The issue is that people will record and share the addresses to which they have sent money, completely out of band, and therefore completely beyond the possibility of Monero helping them.

That's why I said ""keep dossiers"", not ""scan the blockchain"".

If the software doesn't support ephemeral addresses well, then people will use persistent ones. A user will have one address or at most a few.

If persistent, multiuse addreses are normal, then the addresses to which people are making payments become radioactive data. If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

... and that means *Alice* is exposed by *Bob's* approach to single-purpose wallets.

The addresses Alice has been paying may leak because of Alice's ""poor opsec"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of her multisig ""security service"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of one of the dozens of cloud services the average person seems to use for critical purposes these days, or because of software bugs, or for whatever reason. There are lots of places where that sort of thing may end up.

I can spin you dozens of scenarios. Each is probably relatively improbable by itself. But the probability that *some* of them will happen is very high. You can give me mitigation steps the user could take for each of them, outside of the Monero system itself... but taking all the steps to avoid even most of them would be complicated, annoying, error-prone, and potentially expensive.

Mistakes happen all the time, and you have to avoid making them fatal. More than one thing should have to fail before there's a serious problem. It's unreasonable to expect users to take lots of elaborate measures and meet lots of external constraints. If there are measures that need to be taken a significant part of the time, even it's not *all* the time, then the software should take them *for* the user.

Magnifying the effects of ""poor opsec"" is ""poor devsec"".

Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming *and* outgoing transactions. So, for example, if I want to prove that I paid Alice, I also have to disclose that I paid Bob, and, I think, that I got the money from Carol. I have no practical way to know in advance which payments I might have to prove, so I'd better have separate addresses for all of them.

Honestly, from my point of view, the only way to have ""good opsec"" with the wallet you have would be to

1. Create a whole new wallet for every incoming transaction (or at least each payer or related stream of transactions, at a lot finer granularity than my ""identity"")
2. Create another wallet for each *outgoing* transaction, and forward money from the incoming wallets to a single use outgoing wallet before sending it to the final recipient.

All manually. And with backups. That doesn't strike me as being absolutely private with ""very little effort"".

Even worse, I have to rely on all my *counterparties* to go out of their way to do the same sorts of things, knowing that they get basically no support for doing so.

And I don't get this:

&gt; Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked), or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction.

The existing wallet is also ""deterministic"", in that it deterministically uses the same key all the time. If that key leaks, you lose not only all your privacy, but all your money as well. Going to a deterministic multiaddress wallet doesn't increase that risk at all, but it does *reduce* the risk of people linking transactions they shouldn't be able to link.

By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues. However, that said, ""illicit activity"" is kind of in the eye of the beholder. The drug example may have been poorly chosen. Perhaps a better example for Western ears would be that somebody is donating to Falun Gong, or buying porn, or gambling legally in jursisdiction X while dealing with exchanges in jurisdiction Y who are required to freeze ""gambling related"" funds, or buying apostate literature, or...

So, for example, if I want to prove that I paid Alice, I also have to disclose that I paid Bob, and, I think, that I got the money from Carol. I have no practical way to know in advance which payments I might have to prove, so I'd better have separate addresses for all of them.

Honestly, from my point of view, the only way to have ""good opsec"" with the wallet you have would be to

1. Create a whole new wallet for every incoming transaction (or at least each payer or related stream of transactions, at a lot finer granularity than my ""identity"")
2. Create another wallet for each *outgoing* transaction, and forward money from the incoming wallets to a single use outgoing wallet before sending it to the final recipient.

All manually. And with backups. That doesn't strike me as being absolutely private with ""very little effort"".

Even worse, I have to rely on all my *counterparties* to go out of their way to do the same sorts of things, knowing that they get basically no support for doing so.

And I don't get this:

&gt; Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked), or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction.

The existing wallet is also ""deterministic"", in that it deterministically uses the same key all the time. If that key leaks, you lose not only all your privacy, but all your money as well. Going to a deterministic multiaddress wallet doesn't increase that risk at all, but it does *reduce* the risk of people linking transactions they shouldn't be able to link.

By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues. However, that said, ""illicit activity"" is kind of in the eye of the beholder. The drug example may have been poorly chosen. Perhaps a better example for Western ears would be that somebody is donating to Falun Gong, or buying porn, or gambling legally in jursisdiction X while dealing with exchanges in jurisdiction Y who are required to freeze ""gambling related"" funds, or buying apostate literature, or...

We had a discussion early on about decentralised governance within Monero, and decided there was no ""good fit"" for any system just yet. The best we can do is take the voting / funding of enhancements away from our control (via the Forum Funding System), and add some other bits to make code and protocol governance more ""decentralised"" (more on that soon).

But we currently are, and will remain for the time being, the ""benevolent dictator for life"". This is a model that has served Linux well, and we believe it is best suited to making the hard decisions required in a cryptocurrency (and, more specifically, to make decisions as a core team that may not be popular with many people, such as when we decided *not* to change the emission curve).

If, in future, the community decides we're doing a bad job they will replace us. If, in future, we find a better decentralised governance system we will switch to that. None of this is set in stone, but it is ""for the foreseeable future"" or ""until something better comes along.

&gt; Right now the devs are in accord, and all is well. What if in seven years a major rift happens as a result of government intervention into the Monero project. How will we determine who has the 'right' to update the Monero client?

I spoke to this on the Monero forum, so here you go:

""Let's pretend we were facing the same situation as Bitcoin, with a polarised decision that has to be made. It's very unlikely that 1 of the 7 core team members could act like Gavin, because the division would be clear (not so with Bitcoin where there is this misconception that ""only Blockstream devs disagree with Gavin"" or ""everyone that matters agrees with Gavin"" when meanwhile, back at the ranch, he's the only one of the 5 core maintainers that wants the 20mb limit right now). But even so, let's imagine it's 3 vs 3 on the decision with 1 abstain, and the community is torn.

Now here's the clincher: *with planned hard forks we could very easily put the code in and then measure full node uptake over 6 months*. Since the code only kicks in after the 6 month window *and* the node observes a sufficient percentage of blocks on the new version, it simply wouldn't enable that code if there is not sufficient uptake. This could be modified to be both % of mined blocks + % of connected nodes for the sake of fairness. We therefore let the miners and users decide, and we can always nuke that code in the next hard fork update.""

&gt; Perhaps if you are going to create a social framework around Monero (and scheduled hard forks are definitely a social frame work) then a constitution needs to be drawn up as well.

There will be something like this drawn up, that is a discussion we'll open up soon.

&gt; And like it or not, after a certain point (four years sounds good) you are going to need to have a system in place for elections and appointments to the board of developers.

That's exactly what I was alluding to with the BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) thing - we probably won't increase it at all, unless we really have to, and then we'll handle that within the core team. It is very unlikely that there will be so many others who come along that understand decentralised security systems that they become integral and have to sit on the core team (plus not everyone wants to have that responsibility). That is not to say we won't be transparent, but I think that it is best to avoid too formalised a structure there. That having been said, there are peripheral organisations, such as MEW, that can have all sorts of formal structure and that have our ear. Similarly, we could create something akin to the LSB (Linux Standard Base) which provides even more formal control over implementations and interaction mechanisms.

&gt; I know that sounds dire, but what we are trying to do is take humans out of the equation, right? So we should be very cautious about rushing to put humans back into it, even if it's a necessary and rational move.

You're trying to take humans out at the wrong layer.

Open source projects absolutely need guidance and decision making. With something like Monero it's even more important that there's a centralised structure to meet the paradigm that journalists and companies inevitably expect. Having this centralised ""benevolent dictator"" structure is completely fine, as long as we aren't precluding others from making a meaningful contribution (more on that soon).

Where the human element should be taken out is in the network consensus level. Right now Bitcoin is getting this wrong. If Bitcoin needs to hard fork they have to first convince everyone to upgrade. With the combination of the core team as benevolent dictators and the 6-month hard fork rollover we can instead push out a fork and then spend 6 months observing the uptake and acting accordingly.

Oh and before there are any thoughts given to us being in ""control"" there are two things that should be born in mind:

1. We are in control as stewards of the project. That's the nature of the situation, and it won't change. We deserve that control, partly because we are not complete morons and are doing a decent job, but also because we've sunk more time, money, and energy into Monero than anyone else.

2. We inherited that role from thankful_for_today, so we're VERY cognisant that we can be ousted from the community and a new group can take it over. This means that, whilst we are capable of making firm decisions, we are also able to step back and reverse decisions where they aren't met with broad community acceptance.

&gt; if 6-month hard forks become a thing, two competing groups in the future will both fight for their right to update the client

But in the end nodes and miners will decide. Two competing groups would actually make it easier - we could host both downloads on getmonero.org and then miners would be able to more easily select the one they want to vote for:)

Also let's not forget that this structure is not necessarily ""for life"". We will do this until it is no longer workable, and then we'll do something else. The 6 month rolling fork means that we can easily change the software, and changing the systems and core team is also not insurmountable.",,10,xmr,t1_crp8t9s,t5_31hbr,moderator,1432933724,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; There is literally nothing we can do to prevent statistics from being gathered.

TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

In addition, the simple fact that CloudFlare (and you can definitely put Google Analytics in that too) is used by so many sites nowadays make it worse than a typical VPS. Their database, being so much larger and having so much data about so many people, becomes much more interesting to hackers.

&gt; But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

It is just obfuscation, in a sense, but it's also not *that* weak, because an exchange (for instance) will then have a different ""address"" for each person, so it's very unlikely they'll ever publish their address without a payment ID.

To illustrate at a very basic, unstealthed level: let's say my address is ABC. Let's say Poloniex's address is DEF. Poloniex will no longer tell me to ""make a payment to DEF using payment ID 714"", they'll say ""make a payment to DEF714"". Your deposit address on Poloniex will be DEF837. Bob's address will be DEF419. Even if you are proficient and you can unpack the address to ""DEF"" searching for it won't reveal anything because Poloniex will never have publicly listed just that address for payment.

Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

&gt; At least in my case, I'm not asking to force everybody to use single-purpose addresses. I just would like an easier way of producing them that doesn't force me to incur extra fees or write my own wallet.

We don't really have the funding or manpower to build something like this out, so you'll either have to write it yourself or wait for some time in the far future when we are able to commit resources to it.",,0,xmr,t1_cqnfmzz,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

It isn't about the blockchain - you can always simply work off the top block in Bitcoin, Monero or anything else. Rather, it's about the utxoset, i.e. the set of unspent outputs.

In Bitcoin (and Darkcoin and etc.) a spend is always obvious and uniquely identifiable because of the signature. In Monero, you can never know if an output has been spent *precisely because it has true anonymity*. Therefore the set of possibly unspent outputs grows in time. The way around this is to use another data structure, e.g. a hash tree of that set and of the set of unspent key images. This has been discussed in our dev channel, but obviously Monero has more primitive infrastructure needs to sort out at this moment.

I can't comment on Darkcoin's 'untraceability' when it still has no code open sourced. Regardless, the masternode method itself will always be vulnerable to malicious nodes. I find it a bit funny that anyone thinks that imposing a token cost to obtaining a node is a serious barrier for capable institutions.

At a more base level, it doesn't actually do anything you couldn't do yourself in Bitcoin by sending to multiple mixers and hoping at least one isn't corrupt. This makes the whole endeavor questionable considering any real user would want to stick to Bitcoin for obvious reasons. If I wanted to take the trouble and hop off the Bitcoin chain, I'd at least want a technological leap towards true cryptographic anonymity.",,1,xmr,t1_cjvyk44,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Monero i2p nodes will also act as general i2p routers, which increases the size of the i2p mixnet and thus has an upshot for both. A couple of other things that were at the top of the list:

- Tor is optimised for low-bandwidth clients and high-bandwidth exit nodes, whereas i2p is optimised for internal hidden services. Thus, i2p is significantly faster when routing internal traffic.

- i2p's floodfill routers (roughly analogous to Tor's directory servers) aren't hardcoded

- i2p is a packet-switched network (as opposed to circuit-switched) which makes it more robust

- no client-only peers, all peers route traffic and assist in building and running short-lived tunnels

All people ? no not all of them. 2 kinds of people will not be happy that is government people and criminals.
They will try to use any and every method they can think of to see how much money you have and how much they can tax you or steal from you. 
When you go buy a new passport, they will force you to use bitcoin and then datamine your wallet adresses. 
Or this nice delivery guy where you have to pay at the door, will actually work for the criminals. 
Currently already some 60% of all bitcoins can be linked to an IP address. This is going to be much, much worse, due to daily use by a real person with a real house where he really lives and can really be arrested or extorted. People will want their old private paper notes back that they can privately hide under the bed.
Anonymity is important when it comes to money, very important. For this reason bitcoin eventually will decline in use and be replaced with a 
true anonymous currency. Like cash, as was promised.
Anonymity of currency will be good for this planet. Governments will be forced to get their funding from projects that really help the population. Tax will come from utilities. I envision toll roads where the left lane is free, but for the right lane, you pay a little tax. 
There will be no money left for them to buy bombs or bullets to support their old fiat system. 
Work will be rewarding again because the world is free now from the disease what we used to call banks that kill about everything that people have worked for. People will be truly free and prosperous and can choose to support a certain govt project or not. 
Countries will eventually disappear because we are all in the same boat now, economically. Terrorism will disappear because there are no more angry people when the world is finally forced to play fair and stop the currency war.
We are going to be a truly global population. Thank you Monero for making this possible. I am proud to be able to help with changing the world.

Well, you know, seriousness. As in thinking about the best way to get things done, and putting in the effort to do them in the best way. The extra effort of maintaining a nym is active evidence of willingness to do that.

It's even evidence of willingness to give up ""geek fame"" in favor of more important things.

Can you substantiate that in any way, or is it just how you feel? Can you even explain what ""responsible"" means in that context?

&gt; The way I see it, an anonymous dev could just ditch the project with greater ease.

Anybody, anonymous or not, can ditch any project, and especially a project like Monero, with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever. At most you might want to explain your reasons. Being a contributor to an open source project is not normally considered to indenture you to that project.

If somebody put in the effort to learn the code, and made real contributions, why would you think you had some right to expect that person to stick with the project when ""real life"" required otherwise? It's not even disreputable to quit a real JOB under those circumstances. It does not reflect on your good name to do so, unless you've made some kind of promise, which basically never happens.

Perfectly secure cryptography exists (one-time pads) but the size of the keys *must be at least as large* as the size of the messages. If we are willing to allow for imperfectly secure, but still computationally nasty, cryptography,  we can make keys smaller. But there is a trade-off. As keys get smaller, codes leak more and more information.   Bitcoin has relatively small keys,  but Bitcoin is linkable and traceable.  Monero has large keys and unconditional unlinkability... but there are still some traceability issues. Zero knowledge techniques are massive but leak even less information.

So,  yeah, someone may be able to come up with a reduction in blockchain size,  but I suspect that it will just be by a constant rather than any significant reduction. Sublinear ring signatures would be nice,  though... edited to add: due to Moore's law, I think it will be unnecessary in a few years anyway.

Think about it. The address is just a reference on the blockchain. All the wallet software does is create an address for you and give you the keys to go ""hey, this address is mine!"" and subsequently spend the coins owned by that address.

Essentially, your address doesn't exist on the blockchain until someone sends you money. (or you earn some rewards for mining).

And I just confirmed by running simplewallet on my machine without a daemon. 

so, essentially, you could run simplewallet, make an address, and then deposit funds to that address immediately. 


Myself, I would want to make sure the coins make it to my address, because, you know, this is all magic internet money.

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.

Faking the blockchain is trivial, and releasing a purposely crippled miner only lends credence to this theory. In a matter of weeks the Monero team has unravelled and undone the crippled code, and improved the RPC API by adding critical functionality that merchants and exchanges could simply not have operated without.

Even if you take the fact that Monero is clearly leading the innovation race, I would think it dangerous to touch a coin where 82% of it is held by unknown actors who were not publicly observed during the period where they supposedly mined the coin. Having a shady history does not set a good precedent.",,10,xmr,t1_chv7yx9,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

So, unfortunately, your best option at this point may be to keep your coin on Poloniex, with a long (20+ characters), randomly generated password (look into password managers) and two factor authentication at both Poloniex and whatever email you have linked to your Poloniex account.

If you want to play around with bitmonerod and simplewallet, do so, but if you're not comfortable with command line interfaces, you are probably better off trusting Poloniex for now for actual storage of coin.  With a long password and 2FA, your account at Poloniex should be very secure, and then your only risk is with Poloniex itself being compromised (which unfortunately has happened before)...

But if you're not familiar with using command line programs and securing wallet files with encryption, you may be more vulnerable to user error and hacking in trying to create your own secure wallet than Poloniex would be.

But you haven't spun one that's feasible yet. I'm not trying to be antagonistic, so hear me out:)

My address is public and known, I posted it above. I use it as my withdrawal address on Monero exchanges, on ShapeShift.io, and (presumably) on some future eBay-like market when I sell my Star Wars Episode I Stap and Battledroid teaser toy. All of those entities can be subpoenaed and they can reveal all of my ""earnings"".

*But that's all that an attacker can gleam* -

&gt; Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming and outgoing transactions

This is where you're misunderstanding. The viewkey reveals my incoming transactions, but NOT my outgoing transactions. So *at best* an attacker can determine the source of some of my income, but that's where it ends.

The viewkey isn't a magic key that reveals all transactions, it's a magic key that reveals all outputs you control. Right now those outputs can be spent at mixin 0, which would reveal that the output is spent/unspent, but once [MRL-0004](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf) has been implemented that will no longer be the case.

So with this information let's go back to your example:

&gt; If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

&gt; ... and that means Alice is exposed by Bob's approach to single-purpose wallets.

In order to know that Alice has been paying Bob they'd have to ask Alice, not Bob. There's no way for Bob to prove where the funds he received came from, he can only prove that he has control over them. Only Alice can prove ownership of the transactions she initiated.

So Alice is exposed because LEA asked her for her data and she complied.

Similarly, if LEA instead approach Bob, they can see ""Bob has received a string of payments"", but not who the payments are from.

Obviously LEA can beat the information out of both Bob and Alice, but Monero is not a solution to [rubber-hose cryptanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis).

&gt; By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues.

Monero is far from mature, so taken in its current state this is an unsolvable problem: if an advertiser/insurer/enemy knows your email address they can go and offer Poloniex a bucket load of money for your data, and come up with some idea of your personal Monero holdings. But when Monero is mature there will be too many moving targets for that, and knowing your ""net worth"" isn't worth the expenditure.

You can bootstrap the blockchain - downloads are in the OP on Bitcointalk.

Bootstrapping takes minutes to startup, by comparison, but if you don't trust the bootstrap download you'll have to go from scratch:)

After you've sync'd up it's blazingly fast and has minimal resource usage. There's no delay in staying in sync, and catching up after a night of downtime happens within a few minutes.

You've posted your address in this thread. If I find out that Alice has made a payment to that address, doesn't that tell me that Alice has made a payment to you?

Suppose Bob posts his address on his online store, because he's been told that ""Unlike bitcoin where a new address is recommended for each transaction, a Monero address may be safely re-used without compromising anonymity."".

I pointed out that this is a non-issue because the outputs are all denominated by decimal value (e.g. 12.34 = 10 + 2 + 0.3 + 0.04) so there are always a huge number of matching outputs.

Anonymint correctly pointed that this increases the blockchain size (more outputs in a tx). A technically illiterate forum member by the name of AlexGR used this to FUD Monero because he's a big investor in Darkcoin (DRK). It didn't occur to this guy that DRK also uses a denomination scheme and bloats the blockchain relative to Bitcoin. :)

At this point in time, DRK had a bit of a problem because it still had nothing to show and it's simple CoinJoin would be on obsolete on arrival anyway. The developer Evan Duffield declared that he would implement ring signatures in ""version 2"".

A few days later he realized he's out of his depth and has no chance (he's a coder, not a cryptographer). But he had to save face so he announced he's going to stick with CoinJoin because the new cryptography is unsafe and it bloats the chain. So begins the misguided FUD.

A literate user of course realizes that it doesn't actually matter that XMR, DRK, Zerocoin or anything else has a larger chain (unless it was bigger by a factor of several hundred or more, far outpacing memory growth).

They will try to use any and every method they can think of to see how much money you have and how much they can tax you or steal from you. 
When you go buy a new passport, they will force you to use bitcoin and then datamine your wallet adresses. 
Or this nice delivery guy where you have to pay at the door, will actually work for the criminals. 
Currently already some 60% of all bitcoins can be linked to an IP address. This is going to be much, much worse, due to daily use by a real person with a real house where he really lives and can really be arrested or extorted. People will want their old private paper notes back that they can privately hide under the bed.
Anonymity is important when it comes to money, very important. For this reason bitcoin eventually will decline in use and be replaced with a 
true anonymous currency. Like cash, as was promised.
Anonymity of currency will be good for this planet. Governments will be forced to get their funding from projects that really help the population. Tax will come from utilities. I envision toll roads where the left lane is free, but for the right lane, you pay a little tax. 
There will be no money left for them to buy bombs or bullets to support their old fiat system. 
Work will be rewarding again because the world is free now from the disease what we used to call banks that kill about everything that people have worked for. People will be truly free and prosperous and can choose to support a certain govt project or not. 
Countries will eventually disappear because we are all in the same boat now, economically. Terrorism will disappear because there are no more angry people when the world is finally forced to play fair and stop the currency war.
We are going to be a truly global population. Thank you Monero for making this possible. I am proud to be able to help with changing the world.

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.

Faking the blockchain is trivial, and releasing a purposely crippled miner only lends credence to this theory. In a matter of weeks the Monero team has unravelled and undone the crippled code, and improved the RPC API by adding critical functionality that merchants and exchanges could simply not have operated without.

Even if you take the fact that Monero is clearly leading the innovation race, I would think it dangerous to touch a coin where 82% of it is held by unknown actors who were not publicly observed during the period where they supposedly mined the coin. Having a shady history does not set a good precedent.",,10,xmr,t1_chv7yx9,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Bitcoiner since 2011 here; I've never liked any altcoin as much as Monero.

The world has yet to discover the power of CyptoNote's disruptive innovations.

But we are all eager for open-source anon technology.

Coins like Dark, XC, Black, and Cloak have nothing under the hood but hype, hope, and vaporous promises to accomplish what Monero already has done.  There is much work ahead, but our course is clear.

Monero is best positioned to win the anon wars and share Bitcoin's throne, as the sexy new Queen for the now-mature King.

Monero benefits from Bytecoin's two years of experience and is committed to an open-source approach, which is absolutely crucial for surviving ruthless zero trust environments.

Much work is being done behind the scenes; great milestones will soon be passed.  Look forward to modular, scalable RocksDB and i2p integration.

Now that disclaimer aside, lets tear the rest of your post apart. You have confused what zerocoin, and zerocash are and do. They have been vaporware since 2013. There are actual challenges in creating zksnarks in a trustless way and it ultimately means a separate coin on an existing blockchain network (ie. one could transact with bitcoin, or they could transact with zerocoin IOUs on the bitcoin network). These are not upgrades to the cryptonote protocol, they are completely different and vaporware. Cryptonote's use of time tested ring signatures is way better than zerocoin and the related/conceptually worse zerocash.

Sidechains are also vaporware, it is an interesting idea but you have to understand that every blockchain network will also be able to redundantly create sidechains too. These networks will continue to compete for security and investment. Bitcoin will remain be transparent with convoluted opt-in privacy, Monero will remain private with opt-in transparency. But it is just Blockstream's sidechain koolaid that neglects the obvious redundancy that will occur.

&gt;Monero  is a fork of Bytecoin launched in April 2014 with a 1 minute block target. This coin has been launched as BitMonero but renamed to Monero by its community. Few weeks after Monero's launch, an optimized GPU miner for CryptoNight hash has been developed.  Monero development team states official GUI wallet release as one of their primary goals.  Monero teamed up with academic cryptographers,  implemented an extensive aliasing system, OpenAlias,  partially funded Privacy Solution for integrating [I2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P) in Monero,  created an anonymous voting system, URS,  implemented Electrum's mnemonic seeds and released a webwallet.

Perfectly secure cryptography exists (one-time pads) but the size of the keys *must be at least as large* as the size of the messages. If we are willing to allow for imperfectly secure, but still computationally nasty, cryptography,  we can make keys smaller. But there is a trade-off. As keys get smaller, codes leak more and more information.   Bitcoin has relatively small keys,  but Bitcoin is linkable and traceable.  Monero has large keys and unconditional unlinkability... but there are still some traceability issues. Zero knowledge techniques are massive but leak even less information.

So,  yeah, someone may be able to come up with a reduction in blockchain size,  but I suspect that it will just be by a constant rather than any significant reduction. Sublinear ring signatures would be nice,  though... edited to add: due to Moore's law, I think it will be unnecessary in a few years anyway.

-etherium for specific smart contract.

that address made more than 30k XMR with cryptmonero.com pool, contributing roughly 2/3 hash rate of that pool and 2.5% of network hash rate (that's huge). Not sure if he has any other addresses and mining at other pools or not.

This amount of XMR might cost an investor five figures in USD and this guy essentially got it for free. 

Edit: [Mining Monero with malware is not new](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=639375.0), this problem have been existed since very early days of coins. Yet we don't know how many percentage the botnets and malware are making up total network hash rate.

Monero's value will come from usefulness (utility), not from overall scarcity and some numbers fudged on a spreadsheet. When it has utility there will be a natural and gradual price increase, as demand will slightly outstrip supply due to ever-increasing utility (a Monero network effect).

But all of this will take time - maybe even several years to play out. If you are comfortable buying and holding (or even buying a little bit each month and putting it aside) then it will work out well.

Dice sites like what? Did you bother to do any research? On a good day they had whales wagering way over BTC1000. Even if adding Monero proves successful, it's going to be a fraction of the activity/investments in BTC, so I'm pretty certain they didn't add it just to rob you of your XMRs.  
&gt; I have heard that a Monero dice site that is sponsored from a dev is coming soon  

I laughed. Is it going to be trustworthy coz 'sponsored by dev'? Which dev? And most of all who will operate it, name?  
I can tell you straight away, it will either be run by anonymous person (or with faked id), or by company registered in exotic country. In either way, they can just as well run off and there'll be nothing you can do about it.  
To summarise, it's always good to advise people to be cautious. But when when you scream 'scam' at site which already managed to gain decent level of trust and, at the same time, you advise to trust some other, new, untested, untrusted site then, to me, you just sound idiotic.  

ps. SD already have decent bankroll, so likely don't need any more investments. Bets are verifiable even by 3rd party (check their thread) and HE is only 0.5% (variable). You can test it with small amount, see whether you like it or not. There's absolutely no need for anyone to deposit or store any significant amounts there (you can deposit/withdraw every time you play).

Perfectly secure cryptography exists (one-time pads) but the size of the keys *must be at least as large* as the size of the messages. If we are willing to allow for imperfectly secure, but still computationally nasty, cryptography,  we can make keys smaller. But there is a trade-off. As keys get smaller, codes leak more and more information.   Bitcoin has relatively small keys,  but Bitcoin is linkable and traceable.  Monero has large keys and unconditional unlinkability... but there are still some traceability issues. Zero knowledge techniques are massive but leak even less information.

So,  yeah, someone may be able to come up with a reduction in blockchain size,  but I suspect that it will just be by a constant rather than any significant reduction. Sublinear ring signatures would be nice,  though... edited to add: due to Moore's law, I think it will be unnecessary in a few years anyway.

In my honest view, the only reason left to develop/continue developing on Bitcoin is so that it gives leeway for other cryptocurrencies to rise to prominence, given that Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption.

I'm sorry, but Satoshi said it himself about how Bitcoin's core features will never change. Therefore Bitcoin will eventually die out, it's simply too ""stone-age"", and it is in no way, shape, or form, a currency(It entirely lacks fungibility, something even Credit Cards have).

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency.

Think about it. The address is just a reference on the blockchain. All the wallet software does is create an address for you and give you the keys to go ""hey, this address is mine!"" and subsequently spend the coins owned by that address.

Essentially, your address doesn't exist on the blockchain until someone sends you money. (or you earn some rewards for mining).

And I just confirmed by running simplewallet on my machine without a daemon. 

so, essentially, you could run simplewallet, make an address, and then deposit funds to that address immediately. 


Myself, I would want to make sure the coins make it to my address, because, you know, this is all magic internet money. 

Then you could go to mymonero.com (if you trust mymonero.) with your word seed, enter that into the thingy, and then have access to your home-PC generated wallet on mymonero. And no need to pay the 10 XMR fee because if you just generated your address, you don't have any transactions to scan for.

&gt; There is literally nothing we can do to prevent statistics from being gathered. What we CAN do, though, is provide end-to-end strict TLS from users to our servers, and do so in a way that protects and shields our infrastructure (thus reducing that risk profile down to very sophisticated and highly motivated attackers only).

What do you say about this https://blog.paymium.com/2014/02/19/the-cloudflare-mitm/ ?

TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

In addition, the simple fact that CloudFlare (and you can definitely put Google Analytics in that too) is used by so many sites nowadays make it worse than a typical VPS. Their database, being so much larger and having so much data about so many people, becomes much more interesting to hackers.

There are several features that Bitcoin will never be able to copy mainly the ones involving the mining algorithm, the block emission and the total number of coins. Monero is inherently inflationary, contrary to Bitcoin, this is more than enough reason for me to prefer Monero and is the reason many more people will never join Bitcoin (with or without sidechains) this feature not only is fair to the future generations because it allows wealth regeneration in large periods of time (100+ years) but it will protect the network without the need of transactions fees, this is just an example of something Bitcoin can never offer.

&gt; In order to know that Alice has been paying Bob they'd have to ask Alice, not Bob.

No, they have to get the information from Alice. They don't have to *ask* her. They just have to get it somehow. And once they get it, they immediately know it's Bob she's been paying, because Bob has followed the path of least resistance and made a particular address synonymous with his name.

My point is that there are just too many ways for Alice to accidentally leak that address. Addresses aren't going to leak all the time, but they *will* leak. And when they do, your approach increases the impact.

You wanted scenarios. I'll give you a handful of related groups. Yes, they mostly involve somebody's poor opsec, or even bad faith. My point is that poor opsec and bad faith happen all the time and should be compensated for.

And, yes, there are tons of ways for Alice to blow it that don't involve Monero. It's just that there's no reason to add *more*.

Anti-security
-------------
Alice is concerned about somebody stealing her private keys, so she uses a multisig wallet (I assume you want to support those sometime), with one of the hot keys held by a service provider. Every time she makes a payment, she has to tell that service provider who she's paying. The service provider effectively knows everybody she's paying.

1. The service provider profiles Alice's transactions, puts her on a list of ""likely"" pregnant women, and sells that list to a drugstore. Alice starts getting pregnancy-related ads in the mail. Unfortunately Alice, who really is pregnant, is also 17 and lives with rather unenlightened parents, who interrogate her, get a confession out of her, and throw her out. Loosely based on [a true story](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/).
2. Alice buys a used TV from Bob on eBay. Unknown to Alice, Bob normally uses his Monero address to sell crack. Bob even has a nice little Monero FAQ advising his customers to use that same multisig service. Bob is just cheating a little on his opsec, just this once. LEAs catch Bob for other reasons, and demand a list of his customers from the multisig service. Alice gets raided. They shoot her dog.
3. The service provider gets hacked, and the transaction history hits the Net. I'll let you come up with your own consequence here.

Unfortunate omission
--------------------
Alice is getting ready to leave her abusive, controlling boyfriend. She buys a ticket to another town using Monero. She cuts and pastes the address. She uses the browser private mode. But she doesn't remember to clear the paste buffer. Her boyfriend gets on that same computer later on, and happens to hit control-V. He's no computer expert, but Monero is popular; he knows a Monero address when he sees one. The next time he hits control-V, it's into Google search.

Alice gets a beatdown.

The contact
-----------
Alice buys ""private"" things from Bob regularly. She has a contact entry for Bob, with his address in it. Not being crazy, she puts it under a pseudonym, but not being a crypto geek, she doesn't realize that it's still effectively Bob's name.

1. Bob sells specialized porn, which Alice consumes but has issues about. She uploads her contact to Google.  Alice is embarrassed and creeped out by getting ads targeted to her fetishes, and has no idea why.
2. Bob sells generic porn. Alice works for Focus on the Family. One day Alice accidentally puts her contact in the work database. Alice gets fired.
3. Bob raises money for Falun Gong. He's even a good boy and has a separate address for that purpose. Alice uploads the contact to her Baidu account. Alice gets arrested.

I pointed out that this is a non-issue because the outputs are all denominated by decimal value (e.g. 12.34 = 10 + 2 + 0.3 + 0.04) so there are always a huge number of matching outputs.

Anonymint correctly pointed that this increases the blockchain size (more outputs in a tx). A technically illiterate forum member by the name of AlexGR used this to FUD Monero because he's a big investor in Darkcoin (DRK). It didn't occur to this guy that DRK also uses a denomination scheme and bloats the blockchain relative to Bitcoin. :)

At this point in time, DRK had a bit of a problem because it still had nothing to show and it's simple CoinJoin would be on obsolete on arrival anyway. The developer Evan Duffield declared that he would implement ring signatures in ""version 2"".

A few days later he realized he's out of his depth and has no chance (he's a coder, not a cryptographer). But he had to save face so he announced he's going to stick with CoinJoin because the new cryptography is unsafe and it bloats the chain. So begins the misguided FUD.

A literate user of course realizes that it doesn't actually matter that XMR, DRK, Zerocoin or anything else has a larger chain (unless it was bigger by a factor of several hundred or more, far outpacing memory growth).

Obviously we cannot speak for any other coins besides XMR, but your conclusions are provably false.

Heck, we don't consult with them at all on Monero (not for lack of trying, mind you). Bitcoin, too, has experienced a ""floodgate of 100s of new additions"", but has Bitcoin suffered for it?

Electrum), the server keeps a database of address balances and their history. Your client requests the current balance and history for each of the addresses in your wallet. It validates all of this by also requesting and receiving the blockchain headers, and it builds and maintains a local utxoset for your addresses.

Now with Monero, it's impossible to determine your balance. It has to feed you every single transaction from the date your wallet is created in order for you to create a local repository. Plus, you'll need a complete utxoset and key image set for the entire blockchain. Now this is doable, but it is a lot of work, and won't present the same space or bandwidth saving you're accustomed to with Electrum and similar.

He isn't talking about opsec, he's misunderstanding how Monero works (I suspect).

For OP's benefit: a Monero address is *completely* different to a Bitcoin style address, it has both view and spend public keys serialised and not hashed, so your public keys are completely visible by anyone who has your address. Since output ""destinations"" are computed from those keys, but the computation includes some random data, a ""destination"" has no visible link to an address, which means addresses can and should be reused.

&gt; On the off chance of a hit, the LEO's LEA subpoenas a bunch of exchanges for any business done with that address and receives enough identifying information to arrest the seller

I agree that this is a risk, but that's bad opsec on behalf of the person and good police work on behalf of the LEA. Monero isn't trying to encourage lawlessness, but it is trying to provide reasonable privacy by default whilst still provide opt-in transparency (public or private) via the viewkey.

This is also why simplewallet doesn't keep a record of the *addresses* you pay, since they're largely inconsequential except as a record-keeping tool. We may add this functionality as an option to be specified on account creation, but then, like many things, it's a convenience that sacrifices some privacy.

Exchanges, too, aren't obligated to keep the payout address as long as they keep a record of the actual transaction and which outputs were to the recipient (ie. which outputs weren't change outputs), although I doubt we'll ever convince exchanges to change.

The bottom line here is that being ""absolutely"" private with Monero does and should require very little effort, whereas with Bitcoin it requires a great deal of effort. Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked) or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction. Having a reusable address means that for each account you control you only backup once, only have one mnemonic to memorise, you can use OpenAlias to link to it, and you have one viewkey that you can give to the tax man or your accountant or whatever.

At some point we may create some guidelines for more ""absolute"" privacy opsec, but we DON'T want to encourage specific use-cases, especially of the illicit sort.",,3,xmr,t1_cqmybz1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.

Faking the blockchain is trivial, and releasing a purposely crippled miner only lends credence to this theory. In a matter of weeks the Monero team has unravelled and undone the crippled code, and improved the RPC API by adding critical functionality that merchants and exchanges could simply not have operated without.

Even if you take the fact that Monero is clearly leading the innovation race, I would think it dangerous to touch a coin where 82% of it is held by unknown actors who were not publicly observed during the period where they supposedly mined the coin. Having a shady history does not set a good precedent.",,10,xmr,t1_chv7yx9,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

The way transaction are stored into a block is using a merkel tree ( a tree of hash which speed up the block checking). The code of the merkel tree in the monero code based on cryptonote fork seems to be suffering a buffer overflow when 512 transactions is inserted into the block.

When and if Bitcoin becomes big enough, you'll start to see all kinds of terrible things that happen to people that expose their finances to strangers (extortion, etc), a simple Bitcoin transfer can identify you and your transactions and those terrible things could happen to you if this info is in the wrong hands and if you are worth the ""trouble"", mind you that not only you'll be at mercy of groups scanning the blockchain but there will be groups trying to phish you for your finances and how to extract it from you, be with ads or other nefarious means. And the default reply of the community will be, ""its your own fault, you know Bitcoin was always traceable by default"", all this while preaching the ""the next internet"" being this digitally transferable and surprisingly (still) non-scalable token.

You can adjust N by varying the 'mixin' value. Higher mixin = higher N. I'm not sure what the exact correlation is but as someone else said you can always try it yourself and follow the transactions on the blockchain explorer (monerochain.info).

In terms of performance impact, higher mixin gives larger transaction sizes (I think) and also requires higher fees. Will also result in larger blockchain size the more mixin is used, unless the devs do something smart to address this (probably requiring a hard fork).

For your second question - the whole idea is that the transaction is 'fragmented' in such a way that it's (in theory) impossible to tell what is the actual output and what is obfuscation/change returning. 

But yeah try some small transactions and then have a look on monerochain.info to see how they look.

Like any new technology, I understand the first of any kind is likely an alpha test. A new concept will go through all of the rigorous tests that society can throw at it, from practicality, ease of use, exploitability, manipulation, spoofing/knock-off and general acceptance. Being that Bitcoin is a ‘currency’ and also acts as a ‘stock’, I figured that it was subject to the whims of the global market, making it even more susceptible to long-term failure or obsolescence. From early implementation, I was concerned that large investors or organizations with access to large computing infrastructure would corner the market or ramp up the difficulty. I watched small investors purchase GPU mining equipment, invest in ASICS and then cloud mining until the difficulty was hardly worth the effort. We then saw companies go bankrupt, investors lose their money and scammers cash out. When Litecoin and Altcoins in general started to appear, I believed the second phase of Bitcoin was starting and eventually markets would start shifting towards other coins that were still small-scale minable. I still didn’t see any noticeable traits that made Altcoins stand apart from Bitcoins, they were just clones with minor changes to the mining process, but overall they were all macro-minable. The same problem was still apparent; centralization was still possible. I have been waiting for a solid ASIC-hard coin, with privacy features and a non-Meme-Joke/immature image to invest in. I personally believe that decentralization, privacy, ease-of-use, professional brand and a dedicated DevTeam are the key features needed for a long-term successful coin. Most of the other coins with these traits were all deemed as scam-coins or were pre-mined. I have been waiting for a CPU coin that has all of the previously mentioned features without the flaws and that is actively working towards making it easier for the commoner to participate in the market. So far, Monero is number 1 on my list with all of these traits and current promises of continued development for the traits I believe that will make a coin successful in the long-term. While most Bitcoin investors believe that as difficulty becomes out of reach for most people, the price will go up; I personally believe that people will start pulling their money from Bitcoin and investing in something that continues to create currency over a long-term. Scarcity alone doesn’t create demand. Activity and perceived value creates demand. Scarcity is only valued when alternative options are not present. Cryptocurrency clearly will always have more options, therefore believing that scarcity will perpetually drive up demand is a joke. The only reason it’s still dominant is because of it’s level of acceptance. When another coin can achieve the same acceptance, Bitcoin will have nothing left working for it other than it’s PR tenure, which is also due to expire when a better solution arises. 

tl;dr Monero didn’t find me, I found Monero. True decentralization is the key to successful long-term open source currency.

Perfectly secure cryptography exists (one-time pads) but the size of the keys *must be at least as large* as the size of the messages. If we are willing to allow for imperfectly secure, but still computationally nasty, cryptography,  we can make keys smaller. But there is a trade-off. As keys get smaller, codes leak more and more information.   Bitcoin has relatively small keys,  but Bitcoin is linkable and traceable.  Monero has large keys and unconditional unlinkability... but there are still some traceability issues. Zero knowledge techniques are massive but leak even less information.

So,  yeah, someone may be able to come up with a reduction in blockchain size,  but I suspect that it will just be by a constant rather than any significant reduction. Sublinear ring signatures would be nice,  though... edited to add: due to Moore's law, I think it will be unnecessary in a few years anyway. Clever ways to use webwallets and view keys might centralize blockchain storage/scanning without centralizing mining, payment processing, or violating user privacy...",,3,,t1_cnbtpxv,t5_31hbr,,1420171941,,,,,,,,,,,

The only place to compete for the cryptonote coins is a dev community that can execute and implement the cryptonote protocol without spurious network forking.. plus make the new coin code base useable for onboarding more developers.... its still very early for this and there is no clear wins for any of the coins except monero for not being a premined coin.  Bytecoin should get a little credit for not running away after a arguably being a pump and dump coin that died... cryptonote protocol has given bytecoin a second life into the coin.

Execution of a complete implementation is the only real metric to judge these coins.

It is a new blockchain (not a continuation of the Bytecoin blockchain, which was &gt;80% ninja-mined). TFT made some odd choices in parameters (such as the somewhat speedy emissions curve and the one-minute block rate) that raised questions about his motives. He was also resistant to input from the community. So about 5 days after its launch, Bitmonero was taken over by several members of the community (the current core team) and renamed Monero.

Of course, not everything has worked out for either coin. LTC has trouble justifying its existence and use while PPC has to deal with centralized checkpointing and hoarding. There are no direct parallels, but this can help non-technical people get a sense of the difference.

Electrum), the server keeps a database of address balances and their history. Your client requests the current balance and history for each of the addresses in your wallet. It validates all of this by also requesting and receiving the blockchain headers, and it builds and maintains a local utxoset for your addresses.

Now with Monero, it's impossible to determine your balance. It has to feed you every single transaction from the date your wallet is created in order for you to create a local repository. Plus, you'll need a complete utxoset and key image set for the entire blockchain.

When he started ignoring the community's overwhelming desire not to make Monero a merge-mined coin we (the Core Team, current stewards of the project) forked it and sort of came together. The core team did not know each other really, and the takeover wasn't planned. Some of us peripherally knew other members of the core team, so our binding factor was ""right place, right time"" plus each of us not being completely, utterly retarded. Of the 7 core team members 2 are not anonymous (myself and David) and the other 5 use pseudonyms (and practice their own opsec to a greater or lesser degree of their choosing).

2. I think the viewkey functionality solves that problem entirely. Oppressive governments can demand their citizens hand over their viewkeys, more permissive governments can ask that they volunteer them for tax / regulation purposes. Neither of those governments can know if you have a private account or accounts (the privacy-leaking edge cases is what we're tightening up right now through things like i2p integration) so it really is ""private by default, optionally transparent"".
3. We have infinite supply (the block reward reduces to a minimum of 0.3 XMR in ~8 years and then stays at that value indefinitely) so late comers won't feel left out - it's a slightly inflationary cryptocurrency, not deflationary.
4. I think for something like Monero technical excellence will outstrip the competition. Anyone who knows about decentralised security software design and cryptography, and wants to get involved and contribute, would gravitate towards contributing to Monero rather than launch a competitor. Additionally, we're already diverging away from CryptoNote and will continue to do so quite dramatically (to fix their shortcomings and introduce new functionality), so a competitor would have to be forked from us.
5. Darknote is an outlier, I can't tell if they're part of the Bytecoin / CryptoNote scam, but they're certainly an interesting proposition if you want a currency that implements the CN protocol and won't veer away.
6. Lack of funding coupled with impatience from a userbase whose only reference points are the (relatively) mature Bitcoin and a bunch of premined / ICO-funded ~~scams~~ altcoins; heretofore unknown issues in the Ed25519 curve or some core cryptography that we can't replace fast enough; general and overwhelming apathy towards privacy, where people are content with sacrificing all privacy as long as they get ""free"" stuff.",,13,xmr,t1_cr6jmel,t5_31hbr,moderator,1431467431,,,,,,,,,,,

Dice sites like what? Did you bother to do any research? On a good day they had whales wagering way over BTC1000. Even if adding Monero proves successful, it's going to be a fraction of the activity/investments in BTC, so I'm pretty certain they didn't add it just to rob you of your XMRs.  
&gt; I have heard that a Monero dice site that is sponsored from a dev is coming soon  

I laughed. Is it going to be trustworthy coz 'sponsored by dev'? Which dev? And most of all who will operate it, name?  
I can tell you straight away, it will either be run by anonymous person (or with faked id), or by company registered in exotic country. In either way, they can just as well run off and there'll be nothing you can do about it.  
To summarise, it's always good to advise people to be cautious. But when when you scream 'scam' at site which already managed to gain decent level of trust and, at the same time, you advise to trust some other, new, untested, untrusted site then, to me, you just sound idiotic.  

ps. SD already have decent bankroll, so likely don't need any more investments. Bets are verifiable even by 3rd party (check their thread) and HE is only 0.5% (variable). You can test it with small amount, see whether you like it or not. There's absolutely no need for anyone to deposit or store any significant amounts there (you can deposit/withdraw every time you play).

Single POW means all the miners mine one algorithm that feeds the blockchain.

Multi POW means every miner can choose between one of several algorithms he wants to mine on. For example Asic owners can mine SHA, GPU miners can mine Scrypt or Skein, people with high electricity costs can mine an algorithm like Groestl or Qubit which effectively uses up to 50% less power.

It also increases the security of the network. Where single POW coins are vulnerable to 51% takeovers, an attacker on the Myriad chain would need 81% of any single algorithm, or 20% or at least 3 algorithms combined.

Correct, no link.

&gt; What you're saying then is that Monero is resistant against Sybil attacks, because there is no relying on other nodes to create an anonymous transaction?

Correct. Btw this is an important advantage over coinjoin-based privacy systems such as darkwallet for bitcoin or darkcoin/dash, that require other people being available to mix with you. With Monero you can be the only user of the coin for an entire day, that doesn't impact your ability to make as many transaction as you like, they'll be anonymous anyway.

&gt; What I meant by ""vulnerability to botnets"": Where Bitcoin now requires specialized ASIC equipment in order to mine profitably, which reduces the likelihood of botnet mining, isn't Monero vulnerable to something like malware-type botnet schemes?

I'd say people are vulnerable to malware :P  
From the point of view of the Monero network, the higher the hash rate the better the security, and it does not matter where this hash rate is coming from.  
The rational for this ""CPU friendly"" PoW is to keep broad decentralization, more than with SHA256 coins and also more than scrypt ones.

Single POW means all the miners mine one algorithm that feeds the blockchain.

Multi POW means every miner can choose between one of several algorithms he wants to mine on. For example Asic owners can mine SHA, GPU miners can mine Scrypt or Skein, people with high electricity costs can mine an algorithm like Groestl or Qubit which effectively uses up to 50% less power.

It also increases the security of the network. Where single POW coins are vulnerable to 51% takeovers, an attacker on the Myriad chain would need 81% of any single algorithm, or 20% or at least 3 algorithms combined.

I'm a Monero supporter and I don't want to annoy anyone by posting what seems like a shameless promotion of another coin.

I've put in bold the part that doesn't make sense.

Knowing Bob's address doesn't help them get a transaction history from Alice. Alice doesn't have a transaction history that includes the destination address, her transaction history merely includes the transactions. The only extra information Alice has in her wallet history, that isn't on a block explorer, is which of the transaction's outputs came back to her in the form of change.

Practically:

The Monero donation address is 46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em

My address is 49VNLa9K5ecJo13bwKYt5HCmA8GkgLwpyFjgGKG6qmp8dqoXww8TKPU2PJaLfAAtoZGgtHfJ1nYY8G2YaewycB4f72yFT6u

Here I am transferring 1 Monero to the donation address:

    [wallet 49VNLa]: transfer 3 46BeWrHpwXmHDpDEUmZBWZfoQpdc6HaERCNmx1pEYL2rAcuwufPN9rXHHtyUA4QVy66qeFQkn6sfK8aHYjA3jk3o1Bv16em 1
    Money successfully sent, transaction &lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

And here's the transaction on a block explorer: http://chainradar.com/xmr/transaction/4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0

The 1 XMR output that went to the donation address is 9844d5f4d7ab22dab1dc1815578654c54115f19155ebc6995ab2569718f0905c, and that bears no relation to the actual address.

Thus knowing both the addresses has no value, no matter how big your database of addresses is.

Similarly, in my wallet this is all I can see for that transaction:

    [wallet 49VNLa]: incoming_transfers
            amount       	spent	global index	                              tx id
    &lt;-- snip --&gt;
           0.030000000000	  F  	      195895	&lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

ie. all I can see are those two change outputs that came back to me.

And in the recipient wallet:

    [wallet 46BeWr]: incoming_transfers
            amount       	spent	global index	                              tx id
    &lt;-- snip --&gt;
           1.000000000000	  F  	      545645	&lt;4d6a30f7a12580079a99fc427a259845b456fff822f9efb4d4dfe358fd711ef0&gt;

Even if you had all of the addresses of every Monero user it wouldn't be enough. *You need more information*.

&gt; Every time she makes a payment, she has to tell that service provider who she's paying

Having a third-party robosigning for you means that you trust that third-party implicitly with your data. It's unlikely to be tenable if the third-party is the sort that will resell your data, but for some people they're willing to compromise their privacy for convenience, so your point is taken.

We cannot stop people from publishing their transaction history on the Internet, but as you can see in my practical example earlier it isn't much use.

Obviously if Alice wants to publicly state that she paid Bob 10 XMR and is able to reveal the public keys for that transaction's inputs (which can be hashed and compared against the key images) then that's her prerogative, but it doesn't reveal any of Bob's other transactions (both received or sent).

&gt; She buys a ticket to another town using Monero

This won't exist in future once we've completed our work on stealth payment IDs (see the research goals here: https://getmonero.org/design-goals/), as any automated service would (by definition) require the payment to have a payment ID. The ""address"" on the clipboard would include a serialised payment ID, so her boyfriend would need to be adept enough to manually unpack and deserialise the address, repack it into an address without a payment ID, and then the train company needs to have published their address somewhere at some stage (unlikely if they only start using Monero from when stealth payment IDs are complete).

&gt; She uploads her contact to Google

If she's paying Bob privately and he's not using stealth payment IDs (see above) then it's the same as Alice having his email address (which, let's say, is totally_not_weird_bob@gmail.com). All of those connections to Bob can be made by her accidentally uploading the contact with his email.

Also let's be clear: *there is no practical way to enforce one-time address use on a protocol level*, as nodes can never tell what the destination address of an output is. It doesn't matter what we do on the client side, people are going to reuse addresses (just like they do with Bitcoin) because it's convenient and people tend to do dumb things regardless of who it hurts. Even if we *could* enforce it Alice would still need to contact Bob to get a payment address each time, so she'd have his number or email that would trip her up in the same way.",,3,xmr,t1_cqn8vx8,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several features that Bitcoin will never be able to copy mainly the ones involving the mining algorithm, the block emission and the total number of coins. Monero is inherently inflationary, contrary to Bitcoin, this is more than enough reason for me to prefer Monero and is the reason many more people will never join Bitcoin (with or without sidechains) this feature not only is fair to the future generations because it allows wealth regeneration in large periods of time (100+ years) but it will protect the network without the need of transactions fees, this is just an example of something Bitcoin can never offer.

None of the projects you mentioned, including sidechains are enough to draw any reaction from me away from Monero, Bitcoin feels corrupted both as community (scams, dramas, etc) as an open-source project (can't scale, fungibility problems, etc).

I always glossed over the concept that cryptocurrencies are a ""ledger"" - being that I have never used a ledger. As such, the key for me to understand how the blockchain actually works is that ledgers are always ""written to""... a concept that was apparently odd for me, I assume due to generational effects of never balancing a checkbook (computers have always done it for me) and always working with digital file storage, in which, for the most part, you can rewrite anything or delete anything etc. 

So there is no ""debit"" that occurs.... you just own a particular bunch of lines on the ledger. Furthermore, there are no ""tokens"" as I originally imagined them.

Lets assume you just joined Monero, and your name is Bob, - you made a new address, and someone sent you 12 monero, and you've been lucky mining, so you've got 5 monero from mining. On the ledger, there's a line that says ""Bob owns 12 monero!"" on block 500. And some other lines associated with your mining rewards, which probably came in tiny bits, so there are 5 lines of ""Bob owns 1 monero!"" in blocks 501 - 506

So when the wallet software scans the blockchain, it sees all these lines and adds them up to tell you ""You have 17 monero""

Now, if you want to go and send Alice 5 monero, this is NOT what happens, and is what I thought happened until I finally had it explained enough to get it - 

The protocol/wallet/blackbox/whatever subtracts 5 monero from your total account, and adds 5 monero to Alice's account. 

Instead, what actually happens is the protocol/wallet/blackbox scans the blockchain, looking for your lines. It finds the line ""bob has 12 monero"" and the 5 lines of ""bob owns 1 monero"". Based on a variety of factors (especially for monero with mixins etc), the wallet software will go ""I'm going to use these lines for this transaction"". For the sake of simplicity, lets just say it uses the ""Bob has 12 monero"" line.

So in a new line in the ledger, a new line is written that essentially means ""We're going to use that line up there that says 'Bob has 12 Monero'. We're then going to make a new line that says ""Bob has 7 monero"" and also make a new line that says ""Alice has 5 monero"". 

So now when the wallet software scans the blockchain (after this transaction has been accepted by the network), it will still see the original ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line, but then it will see the new transaction that occured that used that line, so it no longer counts it in the total. That line has been ""used up"", or in blockchain talk, turned into an input. 

But its important to realize that the ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line gets turned into an input by the new transaction. In reality (in the database, the blockchain), the line in block 500 still exists that says ""bob has 12 monero!"". But the new line in block 510 essentially says ""That line in block 500 should be ignored, and these new lines should be used instead - the ones that say Bob has 7 Monero and Alice has 5 Monero"".

Well, thats my attempt at explaining outputs and inputs. How'd I do?",,3,,t1_crmqp82,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system.

That being said, it's **essential** that the team focus on the most crucial changes early, and get them in place.  Fun and fancy can come later, but key protocol changes have to happen in the first few hard forks to alleviate exponential suffering later.  **It also means the next 24 months of software development will be the most crucial in the entire history of Monero** (which could be a very long time).

Coins like Dark, XC, Black, and Cloak have nothing under the hood but hype, hope, and vaporous promises to accomplish what Monero already has done.  There is much work ahead, but our course is clear.

Monero is best positioned to win the anon wars and share Bitcoin's throne, as the sexy new Queen for the now-mature King.

Monero benefits from Bytecoin's two years of experience and is committed to an open-source approach, which is absolutely crucial for surviving ruthless zero trust environments.

Let me rephrase: the best anonymity that can be found in the cryptocoins world! I personally disagree with the word ""obfuscation"". Obfuscation means something like coinjoin to me. With ring signatures, it's just maths that make it foundamentally intracable, not just a big noise to obfuscate the signal.

&gt;&gt;  One of very few coins to compliment bitcoin rather than compete.   

&gt; What does this even mean?   
   
""compliment"" is meant to be ""complement"". Didn't catch this, not a native speaker sorry.   
That means most altcoins claim to be better than bitcoin. The hype
around them is all about this, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not.
Take the most valued one by far, litecoin: it is all about ""having
faster block confirmation"", and ""resistant to asic"" (later rephrased
in better CPU/GPU/ASIC ratio, when the original statement was not true
anymore). The claim is just to do better than bitcoin, nothing
less. Which is ridiculous, with such negligeable changes nobody's
going to overcome bitcoin network effect and this is crystal clear
since years.  The cryptonote tech is not something better than
bitcoin, it is just *completely* different. Use bitcoin if you want
full transparency, use a cryptonote coin if you want full privacy.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Impossible to examine block chain for tracking funds.

&gt; There is a big difference between ""extremely difficult"" and ""impossible""

I'm not going to arg on that, you're right in theory. Let me rephrase
it so it is not ambiguous: cryptonote coins are by *very* far the most
difficult to track. I say *very*, because it happens at the math
level, not by just mixing as it was done previously (cf DRK). ""by far""
measures a conceptual gap here.

&gt;&gt; Serious candidate for crypto version of ""Swiss account""

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right again!

&gt;&gt; Devs focusing on foundations not bling.

&gt; What does this mean?

They focus on fundamental things rather than bling-bling that would
make the coin looks more shiny in the eyes of the masses on short-term. Sounds
pretty rational, but it's not what is done by altcoin devs 99% of
the time. 

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Major interest from BTC ""hero"" members and BTC whales.

&gt; Sure, because they are looking to diversify their holdings. Don't
put all your eggs in one basket.

Well yes, but you evade the point here. The point is this: why on
Monero and not another alt? For many of them this is the first alt in
which they invest with a long-term perspective, or even the first in
which they invest at all.  The volume on exchanges is consistantly
puzzling for such a completely new coin based on a little known tech.
For many btc early adopters, they say it publicly, there is only one precedent to
the potential of Monero: that of bitcoin itself.

&gt;&gt; No evidence of any pump/dump.  

&gt; Fluff, and subject to change due to any number of variables.

I disagree, this is not all fluff. Having a low-hype/smart/long-term
oriented community is *very* healthy. Of course it is subject to
change, nobody can talk for the future, but sooooo many new coins
already fail here.   
I really do mean ""healthy"". Consider that it boils down to
having people really trusting and betting on this on a long-term perspective. 
These people will actually *build* stuff, rather than just
trading the high and low before switching to another coin.   
Again, many see only one precedent to this: bitcoin.

Up until the block 202612 attack the C code was ""fine for the moment"". Then there was a real attack that used an exploit that would've been caught in a refactor.

So the priorities shift, because what good is a GUI without a blockchain DB? And what good is a blockchain DB without multi-threaded verification? And what good is multi-threaded verification if an exploit exists in the low-level C code that needs to be refactored?

Just when we start in earnest down that road we have someone coming along claiming to have a ""coin killer"" exploit that [""under the right conditions will allow an attacker to steal your wallets and hijack your addresses""](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=786201.0). So priorities shift again, for what good is fixing exploits that exist in the low-level C code if our user's funds can be stolen?

And now, after wasting time re-analysing all of that we're working our way back up the chain of ""stuff that is both urgent and important""...but I can guarantee that something else will come along that will force us to re-evaluate priorities.

Also, we never said we are underfunded *right now*, we said that funding would be an issue in future. We (the core team) are spending our own funds, and we're fine with that, because having more funds *will not* equate to us being able to do anything faster. The reason is simple: there are precious few people on the planet that can quickly grok the deeper cryptographic issues in play, so when something makes us re-evaluate priorities ALL the members of the core team and all the contributors focus inwardly. Those that can't grok the deeper cryptographic issues also can't do anything else, because nobody is available to provide guidance and assistance with any of their efforts.

A proper post mortem of the attack is what [MRL-0002, ""Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing the CryptoNote Protocol""](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0002.pdf), is all about, and is a worthy read.

The long and the short of it is: the tree-hash.c code that is responsible for transaction hashes within a block had a bug in it whereby any hashes for more than 512 transactions would be computed using uninitialised memory (ie. with garbage). So the attacker slowly built up the dynamic block size limit until they were able to create a 72kb block with 514 transactions in it. Because the hash on transaction 513 and 514 in that block was computed using some random bits of memory on the mining pool's node at the time, a fork occurred. The network eventually chose one of the forks.

We could have patched the bug and carried on, as the network resolved the fork and was fine within 30 minutes of it occurring, but there was a problem with that: nodes stuck on the old fork still existed (in fact I spotted one still around the other day, and this attack occurred in September, 2014). When syncing up and receiving blocks from peers these ""stuck"" nodes are fine, *until you get to block 202612*, when suddenly it sends you a block that you cannot verify. We also found that there were some instances of nodes on the correct fork, but their transaction hashes for transactions 513/514 on block 202612 disagreed. This opened up the possibility for the attacker to spend those funds later on (or even for them to be used in a ring signature) which would cause another explosion.

Thus we had to add in a checkpoint for 202612, except that the block hash is over the block header only (ie. disregarding the actual transaction hashes), so we created an exception that uses a blob hash (ie. based on the raw block). We're actually busy refactoring that out into a more general purpose blob hash checkpoint system, partly for legibility, but also so we can use it in future if there is ever a need.",,12,xmr,t1_cpte8lk,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

* proven and highly relevant marketniche
* great devteam - smartest guys on the block

My cryptfolio almost entirely consists of bitcoin/monero, currently around a 50/50 split. I keep gradually but steadily increasing my xmr-holdings.

Make sure to take all the time you need in order to make an informed decision. There's no need to rush if you eventually decide to buy some. Emission is still around [10.5 xmr/min so roughly 15k a day](http://chainradar.com/xmr/chart). With monero still being off-radar to a lot of bitcoiners this is high enough to supress any exuberance eventually.

He isn't talking about opsec, he's misunderstanding how Monero works (I suspect).

For OP's benefit: a Monero address is *completely* different to a Bitcoin style address, it has both view and spend public keys serialised and not hashed, so your public keys are completely visible by anyone who has your address. Since output ""destinations"" are computed from those keys, but the computation includes some random data, a ""destination"" has no visible link to an address, which means addresses can and should be reused.

&gt; On the off chance of a hit, the LEO's LEA subpoenas a bunch of exchanges for any business done with that address and receives enough identifying information to arrest the seller

I agree that this is a risk, but that's bad opsec on behalf of the person and good police work on behalf of the LEA. Monero isn't trying to encourage lawlessness, but it is trying to provide reasonable privacy by default whilst still provide opt-in transparency (public or private) via the viewkey.

This is also why simplewallet doesn't keep a record of the *addresses* you pay, since they're largely inconsequential except as a record-keeping tool. We may add this functionality as an option to be specified on account creation, but then, like many things, it's a convenience that sacrifices some privacy.

Exchanges, too, aren't obligated to keep the payout address as long as they keep a record of the actual transaction and which outputs were to the recipient (ie. which outputs weren't change outputs), although I doubt we'll ever convince exchanges to change.

The bottom line here is that being ""absolutely"" private with Monero does and should require very little effort, whereas with Bitcoin it requires a great deal of effort. Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked) or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction. Having a reusable address means that for each account you control you only backup once, only have one mnemonic to memorise, you can use OpenAlias to link to it, and you have one viewkey that you can give to the tax man or your accountant or whatever.

At some point we may create some guidelines for more ""absolute"" privacy opsec, but we DON'T want to encourage specific use-cases, especially of the illicit sort.",,3,xmr,t1_cqmybz1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Possiblity 4: Alice leaks. I've already talked about that.

&gt; In all three of the possibilities listed above it doesn't matter that you've obtained the address, since you've obtained them from the sender she can just tell you who she paid.

We're going in circles now. There are lots of paths to leak things like that that don't require total compromise of all Alice's communications.

&gt; If Bob's address is public knowledge then her having it, or having it in a contact on her phone, is actually a protection: you can't arrest someone for knowing something that is public.

You keep making it about arresting people. It's not, necessarily. Not even primarily. And lots of people are willing to make Alice suffer in various ways based on information that's not reliable enough to convict you of anything. The average Alice is more at risk from her jealous boyfriend or her boss.

However, if you want it to be about arresting people, let's talk about that. I am not a lawyer or a cop, but I do have some relevant general and professional knowledge. I'm talking about US law here, because that's what I know best. The US isn't atypical in the West, although of course the details vary. As for the rest of the world, be assured that if I were talking about Saudi Arabia investigating apostasy, the protections would not be nearly so strong.

The ""contact"" example isn't exactly on point here, because US law enforcement *can't* legally just go trolling through people's contacts. But let's run with it. It's not *totally* implausible.

Google, as a private actor, is not bound by rules about illegal searches. Google could turn Alice's information over to the cops if it suspected criminal activity based on Bob's address being there. The cops could legally use that information. Alice might be able to sue Google in civil court later (I'm not sure). But there's legislation under discussion that would definitely immunize Google against that. So it's not COMPLETELY farfetched.

In fact, they already do something along those lines by searching people's data for child porn files (they compare them against a hash list). Those files are very unambiguous evidence compared to a contact, but the principle is similar. So they might not even be suable *now*.

Anyway, suppose the LEAs do somehow legitimately find out that Alice has Bob's address in her contacts. If they find out Alice has Bob's address somewhere else, the rest plays out similarly.

If Bob is a known drug dealer or whatever, and you believe that he doesn't use the address for anything else, and Alice is specifically carrying around Bob's drug dealing address and not, say, a giant directory of lots of random people's addresses, then they probably could, in fact, legally arrest Alice. But they wouldn't. Which doesn't mean Alice is out of the woods.

In the US, you *can*, in theory, arrest Alice if you have ""probable cause"" to believe that she's done something criminal. That means information that would lead a reasonable person to think that there was a 51 percent chance. I believe that the information you base that on has to be untainted by previous illegal searches and whatever. You'd have to talk to an actual lawyer for details on that.

A court might very well agree that Alice's having that address was probable cause to believe she bought drugs from Bob. They're awfully free about that, especially if the cops throw in some generalities about Alice's ""furtive behavior"" or whatever leading to their ""professional judgement"" that she's a likely suspect.

What they could *not* do with that probable cause would be to *convict* Alice of anything. That takes ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". And it's kind of a waste of time to arrest people you can't convict.

But it's enough to engage their interest, at least if Bob is a wholesaler and his customers might therefore be dealers themselves.

If they *do* have probable cause, that's enough to get a warrant to search Alice's house, tap her phone, or whatever... in which case she's going to have her life messed with, and if she's actually guilty they're very likely going to find a lot more evidence to convict her. THEN they arrest her.

Even if they do *not* have probable cause, they definitely have ""reasonable suspicion"". On reasonable suspicion, they can do a variety of things. One of those is set up what's called a ""PEN register"", which is basically a log of everybody Alice talks to on the phone, when, and for how long (it's named after the old technology for doing it).

If Alice's calls are even *suspicious* (say to head shops, lab supply, whatever), let alone being to other known drug dealers, then they can combine that with the Monero address and turn the whole thing into probable cause for a warrant. At which point Alice can, again, be arrested and likely convicted.

100 percent legal.

This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have. You use it to get more information, and you use it to get authorization to use more intrusive means of investigation. You iterate until you have the evidence you need. Every piece of information helps, and once you have enough to make you suspicious, you can usually generate more.

By the way, something similar would play out if they busted *Bob* for some reason, found *Alice's* address in his ""professional"" contacts, and the tracked her by Google or whatever.

I always glossed over the concept that cryptocurrencies are a ""ledger"" - being that I have never used a ledger. As such, the key for me to understand how the blockchain actually works is that ledgers are always ""written to""... a concept that was apparently odd for me, I assume due to generational effects of never balancing a checkbook (computers have always done it for me) and always working with digital file storage, in which, for the most part, you can rewrite anything or delete anything etc. 

So there is no ""debit"" that occurs.... you just own a particular bunch of lines on the ledger. Furthermore, there are no ""tokens"" as I originally imagined them.

Lets assume you just joined Monero, and your name is Bob, - you made a new address, and someone sent you 12 monero, and you've been lucky mining, so you've got 5 monero from mining. On the ledger, there's a line that says ""Bob owns 12 monero!"" on block 500. And some other lines associated with your mining rewards, which probably came in tiny bits, so there are 5 lines of ""Bob owns 1 monero!"" in blocks 501 - 506

So when the wallet software scans the blockchain, it sees all these lines and adds them up to tell you ""You have 17 monero""

Now, if you want to go and send Alice 5 monero, this is NOT what happens, and is what I thought happened until I finally had it explained enough to get it - 

The protocol/wallet/blackbox/whatever subtracts 5 monero from your total account, and adds 5 monero to Alice's account. 

Instead, what actually happens is the protocol/wallet/blackbox scans the blockchain, looking for your lines. It finds the line ""bob has 12 monero"" and the 5 lines of ""bob owns 1 monero"". Based on a variety of factors (especially for monero with mixins etc), the wallet software will go ""I'm going to use these lines for this transaction"". For the sake of simplicity, lets just say it uses the ""Bob has 12 monero"" line.

So in a new line in the ledger, a new line is written that essentially means ""We're going to use that line up there that says 'Bob has 12 Monero'. We're then going to make a new line that says ""Bob has 7 monero"" and also make a new line that says ""Alice has 5 monero"". 

So now when the wallet software scans the blockchain (after this transaction has been accepted by the network), it will still see the original ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line, but then it will see the new transaction that occured that used that line, so it no longer counts it in the total. That line has been ""used up"", or in blockchain talk, turned into an input. 

But its important to realize that the ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line gets turned into an input by the new transaction. In reality (in the database, the blockchain), the line in block 500 still exists that says ""bob has 12 monero!"". But the new line in block 510 essentially says ""That line in block 500 should be ignored, and these new lines should be used instead - the ones that say Bob has 7 Monero and Alice has 5 Monero"".

Do not be surprised that one day it will be ""obligatory"" for us turn our view keys in tax forms, the gov will have a database with all possible view keys and they will create links and fight for their ""interests"", in some places only Monero transactions allowed would be with your personal ID attached somehow.

For small time miners such as myself, the small liquidity of BCN is just not a problem. The buy orders are usually very big, like 5btc on 7 satoshi. That's plenty of room to sell. 

But honestly I really don't care what miners want. I know I want profitability and I know Bytecoin has worked very well for me for months. If miners want liquidity they can stick to Monero. I on the other hand, will enjoy my sweet, high profits.

For instance, if a miner could purchase equipment upgrades in XMR, pay his electricity in XMR, and pay his rent in XMR, that's his costs covered. Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system. With fiat and BTC settlement bridges (ie. that have eventual settlement, not instant settlement) this can happen without the parties even knowing or caring what happens, and it can happen without affecting the price much - or at all.

- fair launch and distribution
- really strong, multi-disciplinary team
- parnership with I2P
- based on the cryptonote technology
- true decentralized anonymity thanks to ring signatures. It's even more anonymous than CoinJoin (and therefore more anonymous than Darkcoin), according to Gregory Maxwell (Bitcoin core dev and creator of CoinJoin)
- very cheap at the moment because it's pretty new
- CPU friendly thanks to Cryptonight algorithm, but can also be mined with GPU (though it doesn't give a huge advantage over CPU)
- lots of Bitcoin early adopters (including myself) like it, because it's the first time we see some actual innovation in the altcoins world
- not a Bitcoin clone, it's a fork of the now dying Bytecoin wich was a complete rewrite and quite innovative unlike most altcoins. Bytecoin failed because it was mined in secret by a few individuals and also its devs left to other projects.

If I buy an ounce of gold and store it securely, I know that -- barring some radical change in our understanding of Physics -- it's still going to be there, still going to be more or less as scarce as it currently is, still be as atomic-scale fungible (only one long-lived isotope!), still be as hard to destroy, etc, etc.

Math is *even better* than Physics, but cryptocurrencies aren't founded entirely on math; they're based on a consensus of which mathematical rules ought to govern the chain's progression.

For me and other long-term value investors the community's commitment to abiding by the original mathematical terms, laid out *in advance*, is a major source of value.  Monero can adopt whatever policies it likes, but please be aware that deviation from rules laid out in advance *and a stated intention or willingness to do so* does actually destroy value in our eyes.  Maybe that means Monero is the wrong coin for me.

If so, okay.

But like a lot of other people I find that there is a lot that ""smells right"" about Monero and what's happening around it (except the whole batshit-crazy bytecoin origin thing, but hey I guess some legend adds to the mystique).  This proposal to change the rules every six months -- and worse, to vest the power to do so in the hands of any particular group after what we saw go down with the BatshitCoinFoundation... it was pretty jarring.

I have to say I really do think Bytecoin is a branding challenge due to inevitable mainstream confusion getting it muddled with Bitcoin. Darkcoin similarly will have an uphill struggle separating itself from the darkweb. Incidentally, the only way an anonymous coin is going to succeed in the mainstream is by proving it doesn't have nefarious intentions connected with tax evasion, money laundering, drugs, terrorism etc. Very difficult to play the libertarian argument when you're called Darkcoin.

No actually its not. Bytecoin is more profitable according to the [Minergate](https://minergate.com/calc) calculator. 

1000h/s gets you 77760 BCN or 1.563 XMR

So XMR profitability is 1.563 * 0.0031 (current XMR exchange rate - low) = 0.0048453 BTC

and BCN profitability is 77760 BCN * 0.00000007 (current BCN exchange rate - also low) = 0.0054432

So, unfortunately, your best option at this point may be to keep your coin on Poloniex, with a long (20+ characters), randomly generated password (look into password managers) and two factor authentication at both Poloniex and whatever email you have linked to your Poloniex account.

If you want to play around with bitmonerod and simplewallet, do so, but if you're not comfortable with command line interfaces, you are probably better off trusting Poloniex for now for actual storage of coin.  With a long password and 2FA, your account at Poloniex should be very secure, and then your only risk is with Poloniex itself being compromised (which unfortunately has happened before)...

But if you're not familiar with using command line programs and securing wallet files with encryption, you may be more vulnerable to user error and hacking in trying to create your own secure wallet than Poloniex would be.

Long-term holders will love that as use increases, so does price and while there is no quick pay-out for investing early irregardless to a coin's actual utility, the long-term effect will be a better and more stable currency which should provide a solid investment for those who aren't skittish or can't hold an investment for more than a week or a month.

-- ""monero is NOT technically usable..."" This if patently false. You can store monero on mymonero without downloading anything and spend them anywhere that bitcoin is spent thanks to xmr.to. The database is still being painstakingly tested and the GUI will follow, meanwhile there are easy options that make monero as functional as any other coin on the market.

-- ""lacks update from the the devs..."" The devs only report on major news and are easily available for questions on bitcointalk or IRC. Also, a weekly missives is created by GingerAle.

-- ""Bitcoin's recession..."" The price has recently risen with the xmr.to news, so maybe the plan of price being equal to utility is working.

-- ""lacks of interest in Monero..."" Don't know how to verify or dismiss this claim, so it remains in the claim's department.

-- ""Network hash rate is dominated by botnet..."" Again, don't know how to dismiss or verify this claim, so it remains in the claim's department.

""With current situation"" anything isn't over or undervalued, the market dictates what the market dictates and is only viewed as unfair by investors of Monero or detractors pumping their own coin or for critics who want an absence of cryptocurrency in the marketplace all together.

Edit of edit: AFAIK Monero was accepted as the #1 coin a few months back, but I haven't heard why it is still listed on the voting page or why it hasn't been listed on the exchange yet. I'm guessing the cryptonote code adds a layer of complexity to the situation and Cryptsy is waiting for an API--but this is admittedly conjecture on my part.

Alice leaks an entire transaction? Including cryptographic proof thereof? Or does Alice accidentally Tweet ""paid 100 XMR for cocaine to 4ABCDEFG""? If she's that dumb Monero isn't going to protect her, definitely not by inconveniencing the crap out of everyone.

&gt; This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have.

So this is how Monero works: we provide the best privacy we can whilst not making Monero a complete pain to use, and still making things like optional and voluntary transparency available.

There's a level of corner cases we simply *can't* prevent, including things like Ed25519 being compromised by the NSA, or the FBI buying up 83% of the output set, or Alice putting her transaction history online.

Of course, if any of these become an actual / recurrent problem we'll see if we can mitigate them, and if not we'll raise the red flag. But our main aim with Monero is, first and foremost, to provide something that is *useful and usable* whilst still retaining as much privacy as is reasonably possible.

Monero is not trying to compete with Zerocash. In 20 or 30 years when Zerocash's cryptography has been more thoroughly vetted then I fully expect it make Monero redundant. Between now and then, though, our aim is not to deal in absolutes and not to preemptively cover every edge case at the cost of usability.

I remain unconvinced that effectively breaking the viewkey functionality and overcomplicating the wallet system provides anything more than absolutely peripheral benefits whilst preventing very few privacy-breaking edge cases.

Perfectly secure cryptography exists (one-time pads) but the size of the keys *must be at least as large* as the size of the messages. If we are willing to allow for imperfectly secure, but still computationally nasty, cryptography,  we can make keys smaller. But there is a trade-off. As keys get smaller, codes leak more and more information.   Bitcoin has relatively small keys,  but Bitcoin is linkable and traceable.  Monero has large keys and unconditional unlinkability... but there are still some traceability issues. Zero knowledge techniques are massive but leak even less information.

So,  yeah, someone may be able to come up with a reduction in blockchain size,  but I suspect that it will just be by a constant rather than any significant reduction. Sublinear ring signatures would be nice,  though... edited to add: due to Moore's law, I think it will be unnecessary in a few years anyway.

* There is a new website: http://www.getmonero.org 
     This features updated design
     There are sections for missives, a blog, the forum, and a work in progress knowledgebase
     There is a new design and research goals plan with a graphical map:  http://getmonero.org/design-goals/
     The website is open and stored in the git repository and the devs are welcoming community contribution

* There is a new research paper at  http://lab.monero.cc
     MRL4 - http://lab.monero.cc/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf
     The idea is they are researching anonymity vs mixin levels and how this can be improved.  This is a furtherization of MRL 001
     They talked about unlinkability and untraceability ... two different things.
     They talked about disallowing a 0 mixin transaction except under special circumstances.

* Age based associations (temporal associations):  There is also new understanding that it is possible to determine the age of coins moved in some circumstances.  The info is based on the way inputs are chosen.   This problem is less important than the MRL 004 problem, and very simple.  The risk is basically Panic when early coins are detected as being moved.

*  Towards the end of the talk they highlight the design and development goals I mention above ^^^  http://getmonero.org/design-goals/

* They discuss how important it is to have libraries finished for 3rd party implementations for things like iOs/Android etc so not only can the wallet be coded well, but others can develop apps etc via these tools.

* They defend the slow development pace (&lt;-that is semi editorial) by saying they are still carefully laying groundwork for an enterprise grade product as opposed to trying to just make things like wallets. For example the library development as opposed to a WALLET NOW.",,2,,t1_couhndi,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Possiblity 4: Alice leaks. I've already talked about that.

&gt; In all three of the possibilities listed above it doesn't matter that you've obtained the address, since you've obtained them from the sender she can just tell you who she paid.

We're going in circles now. There are lots of paths to leak things like that that don't require total compromise of all Alice's communications.

&gt; If Bob's address is public knowledge then her having it, or having it in a contact on her phone, is actually a protection: you can't arrest someone for knowing something that is public.

You keep making it about arresting people. It's not, necessarily. Not even primarily. And lots of people are willing to make Alice suffer in various ways based on information that's not reliable enough to convict you of anything. The average Alice is more at risk from her jealous boyfriend or her boss.

However, if you want it to be about arresting people, let's talk about that. I am not a lawyer or a cop, but I do have some relevant general and professional knowledge. I'm talking about US law here, because that's what I know best. The US isn't atypical in the West, although of course the details vary. As for the rest of the world, be assured that if I were talking about Saudi Arabia investigating apostasy, the protections would not be nearly so strong.

The ""contact"" example isn't exactly on point here, because US law enforcement *can't* legally just go trolling through people's contacts. But let's run with it. It's not *totally* implausible.

Google, as a private actor, is not bound by rules about illegal searches. Google could turn Alice's information over to the cops if it suspected criminal activity based on Bob's address being there. The cops could legally use that information. Alice might be able to sue Google in civil court later (I'm not sure). But there's legislation under discussion that would definitely immunize Google against that. So it's not COMPLETELY farfetched.

In fact, they already do something along those lines by searching people's data for child porn files (they compare them against a hash list). Those files are very unambiguous evidence compared to a contact, but the principle is similar. So they might not even be suable *now*.

Anyway, suppose the LEAs do somehow legitimately find out that Alice has Bob's address in her contacts. If they find out Alice has Bob's address somewhere else, the rest plays out similarly.

If Bob is a known drug dealer or whatever, and you believe that he doesn't use the address for anything else, and Alice is specifically carrying around Bob's drug dealing address and not, say, a giant directory of lots of random people's addresses, then they probably could, in fact, legally arrest Alice. But they wouldn't. Which doesn't mean Alice is out of the woods.

In the US, you *can*, in theory, arrest Alice if you have ""probable cause"" to believe that she's done something criminal. That means information that would lead a reasonable person to think that there was a 51 percent chance. I believe that the information you base that on has to be untainted by previous illegal searches and whatever. You'd have to talk to an actual lawyer for details on that.

A court might very well agree that Alice's having that address was probable cause to believe she bought drugs from Bob. They're awfully free about that, especially if the cops throw in some generalities about Alice's ""furtive behavior"" or whatever leading to their ""professional judgement"" that she's a likely suspect.

What they could *not* do with that probable cause would be to *convict* Alice of anything. That takes ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". And it's kind of a waste of time to arrest people you can't convict.

But it's enough to engage their interest, at least if Bob is a wholesaler and his customers might therefore be dealers themselves.

If they *do* have probable cause, that's enough to get a warrant to search Alice's house, tap her phone, or whatever... in which case she's going to have her life messed with, and if she's actually guilty they're very likely going to find a lot more evidence to convict her. THEN they arrest her.

Even if they do *not* have probable cause, they definitely have ""reasonable suspicion"". On reasonable suspicion, they can do a variety of things. One of those is set up what's called a ""PEN register"", which is basically a log of everybody Alice talks to on the phone, when, and for how long (it's named after the old technology for doing it).

If Alice's calls are even *suspicious* (say to head shops, lab supply, whatever), let alone being to other known drug dealers, then they can combine that with the Monero address and turn the whole thing into probable cause for a warrant. At which point Alice can, again, be arrested and likely convicted.

100 percent legal.

This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have. You use it to get more information, and you use it to get authorization to use more intrusive means of investigation. You iterate until you have the evidence you need. Every piece of information helps, and once you have enough to make you suspicious, you can usually generate more.

By the way, something similar would play out if they busted *Bob* for some reason, found *Alice's* address in his ""professional"" contacts, and the tracked her by Google or whatever.

I will try to use our time productively by sharing some educational information that could hopefully trump this boring elevator music:

Governments are printing paper money like confetti and in the process they are diluting our purchasing power of our savings with inflation.  In the process the bankers are getting richer and governments are misappropriating taxpayer money whilst the poor have to bear the financial tax burden of bailouts of the financial system for the horrible behaviour of the corruptible politicians.  Everyone can associate with the induced business cycles by the Federal Reserve System.  I am sure you are most familiar with what happened in 2008 during the world-wide recession, Cyprus bank bail ins and numerous other examples.

With the invention of Bitcoin the power of money creation is systematically eroded from governments.   The cryptographically protected decentralised ledger of Bitcoin is a revolutionary breakthrough because it converts money into an incorruptible protocol, the use of which is totally voluntary in contrast with the fiat money that is issued by governments that’s  use is violently being enforced via legal tender laws and gangs with guns i.e. police and military.

Bitcoin is undeniably a great achievement in generating a worldwide decentralised consensus ledger in a frictionless way, which forms a very sounds basis for a monetary platform.  However, the traceability of transactions through the Bitcoin ledger undermines financial privacy that in the current digital age of Orwellian government surveillance is undermining human liberty.  Financial privacy is as much a human right as any other and needs protection, hence the invention of Monero.

Monero’s cryptographic protocol achieves what Bitcoin was intended to but couldn’t because of fundamental cryptographic limitations.  In the long run the anonymous Monero protocol could mean more for financial freedom and liberty than Bitcoin.  Whilst Bitcoin could end the reliance on a parasitic Federal Reserve System, Monero could also end government and third party spying on your everyday financial transactions.

So, my hope is that you would feel intrigued and inquisitive in Googling the revolution that is Monero for yourself.  See you on the online forums.  Google will lead you there.

Have a great day and I hope this elevator trip will be most memorable.  
Adios!

When you send Monero from address A to address B it's multiple inputs / outputs, and the higher your mixin count the higher the input / output count (to obscure the transaction - think of it like a normal coin mixer but on steroids because it uses multiple amounts and multiple inputs/outputs). So if everyone starts sending anonymous transactions with a mixin of 10, the blockchain is going to be quite a bit larger than Bitcoin's by the time Monero hit's the same usage level as Bitcoin.

Practically, what does that mean? Well, with Bitcoin doing around 70k transactions a day, the blockchain grows by about 1gb a month. So when there are 70k actual transactions (not obfuscated, ambiguous transactions) a day, the Monero blockchain will take on 5gb - 8gb a month. With heavy growth and the advantage of Bitcoin paving the way + the network effect, you can expect us to reach that stage in about 4 years. Which means we have 4 years in which to get SPV-style clients (Electrum etc.) for Monero out and working well so that the number of users that choose to run a full node is reduced to only those that have the capacity.

Also, bear in mind that by 2018 when the blockchain is growing by 5gb - 8gb a day, 4tb or 8tb hard drives will be common...so it's not going to make as much of an issue as anyone imagines it will be.

I will try to use our time productively by sharing some educational information that could hopefully trump this boring elevator music:

Governments are printing paper money like confetti and in the process they are diluting our purchasing power of our savings with inflation.  In the process the bankers are getting richer and governments are misappropriating taxpayer money whilst the poor have to bear the financial tax burden of bailouts of the financial system for the horrible behaviour of the corruptible politicians.  Everyone can associate with the induced business cycles by the Federal Reserve System.  I am sure you are most familiar with what happened in 2008 during the world-wide recession, Cyprus bank bail ins and numerous other examples.

With the invention of Bitcoin the power of money creation is systematically eroded from governments.   The cryptographically protected decentralised ledger of Bitcoin is a revolutionary breakthrough because it converts money into an incorruptible protocol, the use of which is totally voluntary in contrast with the fiat money that is issued by governments that’s  use is violently being enforced via legal tender laws and gangs with guns i.e. police and military.

Bitcoin is undeniably a great achievement in generating a worldwide decentralised consensus ledger in a frictionless way, which forms a very sounds basis for a monetary platform.  However, the traceability of transactions through the Bitcoin ledger undermines financial privacy that in the current digital age of Orwellian government surveillance is undermining human liberty.  Financial privacy is as much a human right as any other and needs protection, hence the invention of Monero.

Monero’s cryptographic protocol achieves what Bitcoin was intended to but couldn’t because of fundamental cryptographic limitations.  In the long run the anonymous Monero protocol could mean more for financial freedom and liberty than Bitcoin.  Whilst Bitcoin could end the reliance on a parasitic Federal Reserve System, Monero could also end government and third party spying on your everyday financial transactions.

So, my hope is that you would feel intrigued and inquisitive in Googling the revolution that is Monero for yourself.  See you on the online forums.  Google will lead you there.

Have a great day and I hope this elevator trip will be most memorable.  
Adios!

I have never doubted that and never said I doubted it. Seriously, whatever's on the block chain, and whatever's sent in the protocol, has nothing to with my issue. Nor do I doubt your assertion that the wallet software doesn't keep a history of addresses it's sent money to.

All of my concerns are about leakage *outside of and around* the actual Monero software.

What I'm saying is that Alice is going to be leaky. She is going to make mistakes, and those mistakes are sometimes going to disclose the addresses she's paying to. Sometimes she'll make technical mistakes, and sometimes she'll just trust the wrong people or software. Alice will leak recipient addresses through pathways that are *not part of the wallet, not part of the block chain, and in no way under your control*. Sometimes Alice will even leak for actually rational reasons.

If you encourage Bob to make his address a unique identifier for him, or even for one of his lines of business, that makes Alice's leakiness a bigger risk for her (and probably for him, too).

You seem to be taking the position that Alice just shouldn't leak. But that's not how real users work in the real world. You have to do everything possible to *help* Alice not to leak... and then assume she will anyway, and try to minimize the impact of that.

&gt; Also let's be clear: *there is no practical way to enforce one-time address use on a protocol level*

Obviously not. But that doesn't mean that the way the wallet software works doesn't have an enormous impact on when and whether one-time addresses *actually get used*. Not only does it affect the relative convenience, but it affects the expectations that get built up, and sometimes locked in, in surrounding systems.

It also affects the profitability for attackers of developing tools and capabilities to exploit the address reuse case, and that matters in practice.

&gt; Having a third-party robosigning for you means that you trust that third-party implicitly with your data.

Um, that really depends on what you mean by ""my data"".

It's one thing to trust a third party with a unique ephemeral recipient address that will only ever be used in one transaction, knowing that it's relatively likely that the address really is ephemeral, because the whole surrounding system is built to make that the path of least resistance.

It's a different thing to trust a third party with what amounts to the True Name of the recipient.

There are gradations and variations, of course. For example, for this particular case, you could do something like a Bitcoin stealth address, and have Alice generate an address she *knew* was unique to hand to the third party. In that case, she could still leak the underlying stealth address, but she at least wouldn't be forced to give full information to the third party.

&gt;&gt; She uploads her contact to Google

&gt; If she's paying Bob privately and he's not using stealth payment IDs (see above) then it's the same as Alice having his email address (which, let's say, is totally_not_weird_bob@gmail.com). All of those connections to Bob can be made by her accidentally uploading the contact with his email.

Yes, it's true that any other publicly known identifier for Bob is equally dangerous.

But this is a good example of how reality intrudes, and how little details can make people change people's behavior to make them leak. Bob's email address isn't 96 characters of base64. Alice can memorize Bob's email address easily enough. Or she can obfuscate it in a way that she can reverse mentally. She can't do either with a Monero address, so she has more incentive to store it in a database somewhere (contacts or otherwise).

Furthermore, if she's not like you or me, Alice is less likely to subjectively *realize* that she needs to protect that address. She's got a very good chance of seeing Bob's email address as a name for Bob, and a significantly smaller chance of recognizing his Monero address as one.

This is uninteresting information. Things you are ignoring:

1) [Change](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change). Sum of inputs = sum of outputs + fees. But every denominated amount is contained in its own address so you don't know how much was sent back. Say I have a $20 bill and owe you $9.23. On the blockchain this looks like $20 was broken up into a bunch of little amounts, but no one can tell how much went to you and how much went back to me.

(By the way, Monero doesn't just always do 1.23 = 1 + 0.2 + 0.03, it also does other combinations like 0.6+0.4+0.2+0.002+0.001 etc.).

2) Aside from the ring signatures used to receive 123.456 XMR and to send it out, other users are performing ring signatures that may use your outputs. In the intervening time between your send and receive, your outputs could have been mixed with other users. In fact, even after you send it to a new wallet, your 20, 3, 0.4, etc. are forever in the blockchain getting mixed into transactions. It can never be known when even one of these denominated amounts was truly spent.

With these two points, it's a pretty big stretch to try to connect any two transactions by appealing to human psychology. You could maybe try that argument in a network with a 100 users. Any larger and credibility quickly goes down.

Of course, you could just render this psychological appeal moot by breaking your 123.456 XMR in 2 sends to your new wallet (they're unlinkable because of one-time addresses). I personally wouldn't even bother. :P",,1,xmr,t1_ck4uj7c,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

You can adjust N by varying the 'mixin' value. Higher mixin = higher N. I'm not sure what the exact correlation is but as someone else said you can always try it yourself and follow the transactions on the blockchain explorer (monerochain.info).

In terms of performance impact, higher mixin gives larger transaction sizes (I think) and also requires higher fees. Will also result in larger blockchain size the more mixin is used, unless the devs do something smart to address this (probably requiring a hard fork).

This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.

Faking the blockchain is trivial, and releasing a purposely crippled miner only lends credence to this theory. In a matter of weeks the Monero team has unravelled and undone the crippled code, and improved the RPC API by adding critical functionality that merchants and exchanges could simply not have operated without.

Even if you take the fact that Monero is clearly leading the innovation race, I would think it dangerous to touch a coin where 82% of it is held by unknown actors who were not publicly observed during the period where they supposedly mined the coin. Having a shady history does not set a good precedent.",,10,xmr,t1_chv7yx9,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

2. I think the viewkey functionality solves that problem entirely. Oppressive governments can demand their citizens hand over their viewkeys, more permissive governments can ask that they volunteer them for tax / regulation purposes. Neither of those governments can know if you have a private account or accounts (the privacy-leaking edge cases is what we're tightening up right now through things like i2p integration) so it really is ""private by default, optionally transparent"".
3. We have infinite supply (the block reward reduces to a minimum of 0.3 XMR in ~8 years and then stays at that value indefinitely) so late comers won't feel left out - it's a slightly inflationary cryptocurrency, not deflationary.
4. I think for something like Monero technical excellence will outstrip the competition. Anyone who knows about decentralised security software design and cryptography, and wants to get involved and contribute, would gravitate towards contributing to Monero rather than launch a competitor. Additionally, we're already diverging away from CryptoNote and will continue to do so quite dramatically (to fix their shortcomings and introduce new functionality), so a competitor would have to be forked from us.
5. Darknote is an outlier, I can't tell if they're part of the Bytecoin / CryptoNote scam, but they're certainly an interesting proposition if you want a currency that implements the CN protocol and won't veer away.
6. Lack of funding coupled with impatience from a userbase whose only reference points are the (relatively) mature Bitcoin and a bunch of premined / ICO-funded ~~scams~~ altcoins; heretofore unknown issues in the Ed25519 curve or some core cryptography that we can't replace fast enough; general and overwhelming apathy towards privacy, where people are content with sacrificing all privacy as long as they get ""free"" stuff.",,13,xmr,t1_cr6jmel,t5_31hbr,moderator,1431467431,,,,,,,,,,,

At the moment, for example, the Bitcoin blockchain can easily be attacked *by a very motivated attacker with a lot of money to purchase/build mining equipment*. The larger the Bitcoin network becomes, the less likely this attack is possible. The same goes for Monero: it's (relatively) cheap to attack the Monero network right now, like under $10 million for the equipment. But, as the network grows, that attack becomes a lot less likely.  
It would be naïve of us (or an outright lie at worst) to claim that Monero is magically secure or impervious to attack, but we do constantly work at improving both the security and privacy of Monero. See, for example, the [Monero Research Lab MRL-0004 research bulletin](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf) where we detail various privacy related attacks inherent in CryptoNote, and how we're fixing them in the Monero protocol.  
We don't know who created CryptoNote (but hey, we don't know who created Bitcoin either, so there's that;) but suffice it to say that Monero has already significantly improved on that foundation as we continue to diverge away from it.

2. If you're looking to deal OTC then [MoneroClub](https://www.moneroclub.com/offers/) is a good start, or #monero-otc on Freenode. Exchanges that have Monero markets are Poloniex, Bittrex, Melotic, and Bittrex (most of their altcoin markets are, however, still locked at this moment).

3. Your Monero account has two keys: a view key, and a spend key. You can read more about them on the [Moneropedia article on Monero accounts](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/account). MyMonero works by knowing your view key, but not your spend key, so there's no way for it to be able to spend your funds without your involvement. *This does not protect you from malicious software on your computer spending your funds*, but that is a matter of practicing good security.

4. The blockchain is about 5gb at the moment. I believe lightWallet already works on OS X, as it is written in python, and Jojatekok is working on a new version of MoneroX that is cross-platform.",,7,xmr,t1_cpcccwx,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Nobody on the core team thinks of me in a PR role, and my technical expertise, committed code, and cryptographically sound architecture and designs indicate quite the opposite. I have no PR training or education, nor do I have any interest in PR. I checked the definition of PR quickly to make sure I wasn't doing this without consciously knowing so, and Google tells me that PR is ""the professional maintenance of a favourable public image by a company or other organization or a famous person.""

Now like any person with an iota of self-worth, I am understandably proud of what we have accomplished thus far, and I would always want to put our best foot forward. But I'm pragmatic at the worst of times, and where we have messed up I'll be the first to go ""we screwed up"". Where we are failing to deliver, I'll be the first against the wall. If you want to interpret that as some sort of PR exercise...well...I can't stop you.

Personally, I think Darkcoin will take over the illicit elements of Bitcoin in the near term as Bitcoin becomes more ""legitimate"".  Eventually, we will see another massive bitcoin bubble, and the powers that be will take note of and crack down on Darkcoin.  People running Masternodes in the US and extraditable countries will be fucked and the price of Darkcoin will tank.  This may or may not kill it... depends on how decentralized it has become by that point.

&gt; There is literally nothing we can do to prevent statistics from being gathered. What we CAN do, though, is provide end-to-end strict TLS from users to our servers, and do so in a way that protects and shields our infrastructure (thus reducing that risk profile down to very sophisticated and highly motivated attackers only).

What do you say about this https://blog.paymium.com/2014/02/19/the-cloudflare-mitm/ ?

TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

In addition, the simple fact that CloudFlare (and you can definitely put Google Analytics in that too) is used by so many sites nowadays make it worse than a typical VPS. Their database, being so much larger and having so much data about so many people, becomes much more interesting to hackers.

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Thought I’d let you know about a few tools we developed for Altcoin Communities.

Firstly the comprehensive price index on the home page (bravenewcoin.com). 

Click on the arrow to the right of any coin to see a nice dropdown chart. 

Then check out Embeddable tickers page here http://bravenewcoin.com/tickers/

Just select whichever coin you want and copy/paste the code for that coin, displayed below, into your website design. 

We also have a coin profile page here http://bravenewcoin.com/coins/monero which acts like an info hub. 

We collect data from over 50 exchanges in over 23 trading pairs for over 65 coins. We have worked tirelessly for months securing out methodology, data processing and infrastructure. Our data is at a level where we can start supplying government or corporates with custom feeds. 

Our production schedule for August includes: Comprehensive Bitcoin Directory, zerohedge.com style community news section, Profiles for all Exchanges, profiles for hundreds of Crypto-Currency related companies.

Production Schedule for mid August to Dec includes: Comprehensive portfolio management tools and much needed Quickbooks, Fastbooks, MYOB &amp; Xero accounting software plugins. 

Lastly we have an Android App available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Techemy.BraveNewCoin 

The iOS version is coming in the next 2 weeks. An update is coming for Android in the next 2 weeks that includes being able to ‘favorite’ coins, having the coins summary on the home screen click-able to the data page and sorting of home screen by volume or other metrics.

I have to say I really do think Bytecoin is a branding challenge due to inevitable mainstream confusion getting it muddled with Bitcoin. Darkcoin similarly will have an uphill struggle separating itself from the darkweb. Incidentally, the only way an anonymous coin is going to succeed in the mainstream is by proving it doesn't have nefarious intentions connected with tax evasion, money laundering, drugs, terrorism etc. Very difficult to play the libertarian argument when you're called Darkcoin.

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing. To make matters worse, we spent the first 6 months with completely mixed objectives, whilst still coming to grips with cryptography and a codebase we were unfamiliar with, whilst still patching a never-ending list of rapidly emerging issues, whilst getting to know *each other* as members of the core team, whilst still having to work to make a living.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets. So we start researching a bloom-filter style viewkey lookup, then we get hammered on ""breaking exploits"" from BCX. So we start figuring out what the exploit could-possibly-maybe-not-sure-who-knows-be, then we actually do get attacked. So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero  
https://github.com/tippero/tippero  
https://github.com/roosmaa/go-monero

https://github.com/openalias/openalias-api  
https://github.com/Jojatekok/MoneroGui.Net  
https://github.com/jwinterm/lightWallet

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

If you want to play around with bitmonerod and simplewallet, do so, but if you're not comfortable with command line interfaces, you are probably better off trusting Poloniex for now for actual storage of coin.

First off, it's easy to Sybil attack (by creating fake nodes), so there's a danger in that. Second problem is that you have to barely incentivise them, because if you over-incentivise then you create a Darkcoin-like scenario where there are perverse incentives (for nodes to attack each other to thin the herd, so to speak, and earn more).

There are two basic options: [Justus Ranvier's ""make everything a market"" idea](https://bitcoinism.liberty.me/2015/02/09/economic-fallacies-and-the-block-size-limit-part-2-price-discovery/) where you pay for timeliness of a node, or a scheme I came up with that smooth helped me work through that *may* be doable and somewhat simpler to implement / use. We also don't have payment channels in Monero, so Justus Ranvier's system may not be workable for us as yet.

Basically the idea I had was for nodes to be able to set a completely optional donation address. Miners will then have a default-on setting to donate all the tx fees they receive (since they aren't reliant on tx fees for profitability, as we have the minimum block reward thing) to a random node in the connection pool. The rules are that the node has to be 1. be in the whitelist, 2. have been seen in the last 24 hours, 3. have been connected to the miner node for more than 1 hour in those 24 hours.

Because it's completely optional nobody is forced into doing it, but because it's enabled by default the nodes that also have smart mining on (when that gets finished) will ensure that there are at least some miners donating. Also in order to add to this, and not make it difficult for people to cover their costs, we can traverse the network and have a running list of donation addresses that users can voluntarily donate to.

The advantage of this over something like Justus' approach is that we don't have to care about Sybil attacks, because the incentive is so small (cost-covering at best). But at the same time, it's hopefully enough incentive for people to run a $5 VPS or a node on their home network.",,2,xmr,t1_crs0o0o,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

My address is public and known, I posted it above. I use it as my withdrawal address on Monero exchanges, on ShapeShift.io, and (presumably) on some future eBay-like market when I sell my Star Wars Episode I Stap and Battledroid teaser toy. All of those entities can be subpoenaed and they can reveal all of my ""earnings"".

*But that's all that an attacker can gleam* -

&gt; Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming and outgoing transactions

This is where you're misunderstanding. The viewkey reveals my incoming transactions, but NOT my outgoing transactions. So *at best* an attacker can determine the source of some of my income, but that's where it ends.

The viewkey isn't a magic key that reveals all transactions, it's a magic key that reveals all outputs you control. Right now those outputs can be spent at mixin 0, which would reveal that the output is spent/unspent, but once [MRL-0004](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf) has been implemented that will no longer be the case.

So with this information let's go back to your example:

&gt; If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

&gt; ... and that means Alice is exposed by Bob's approach to single-purpose wallets.

In order to know that Alice has been paying Bob they'd have to ask Alice, not Bob. There's no way for Bob to prove where the funds he received came from, he can only prove that he has control over them. Only Alice can prove ownership of the transactions she initiated.

So Alice is exposed because LEA asked her for her data and she complied.

Similarly, if LEA instead approach Bob, they can see ""Bob has received a string of payments"", but not who the payments are from.

Obviously LEA can beat the information out of both Bob and Alice, but Monero is not a solution to [rubber-hose cryptanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis).

&gt; By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues.

Monero is far from mature, so taken in its current state this is an unsolvable problem: if an advertiser/insurer/enemy knows your email address they can go and offer Poloniex a bucket load of money for your data, and come up with some idea of your personal Monero holdings. But when Monero is mature there will be too many moving targets for that, and knowing your ""net worth"" isn't worth the expenditure. It's easier to just figure out where you live and spy on you:-P",,2,xmr,t1_cqn3vny,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

You can bootstrap the blockchain - downloads are in the OP on Bitcointalk.

Bootstrapping takes minutes to startup, by comparison, but if you don't trust the bootstrap download you'll have to go from scratch:)

After you've sync'd up it's blazingly fast and has minimal resource usage. There's no delay in staying in sync, and catching up after a night of downtime happens within a few minutes.

A proper post mortem of the attack is what [MRL-0002, ""Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing the CryptoNote Protocol""](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0002.pdf), is all about, and is a worthy read.

The long and the short of it is: the tree-hash.c code that is responsible for transaction hashes within a block had a bug in it whereby any hashes for more than 512 transactions would be computed using uninitialised memory (ie. with garbage). So the attacker slowly built up the dynamic block size limit until they were able to create a 72kb block with 514 transactions in it. Because the hash on transaction 513 and 514 in that block was computed using some random bits of memory on the mining pool's node at the time, a fork occurred. The network eventually chose one of the forks.

We could have patched the bug and carried on, as the network resolved the fork and was fine within 30 minutes of it occurring, but there was a problem with that: nodes stuck on the old fork still existed (in fact I spotted one still around the other day, and this attack occurred in September, 2014). When syncing up and receiving blocks from peers these ""stuck"" nodes are fine, *until you get to block 202612*, when suddenly it sends you a block that you cannot verify. We also found that there were some instances of nodes on the correct fork, but their transaction hashes for transactions 513/514 on block 202612 disagreed. This opened up the possibility for the attacker to spend those funds later on (or even for them to be used in a ring signature) which would cause another explosion.

Thus we had to add in a checkpoint for 202612, except that the block hash is over the block header only (ie. disregarding the actual transaction hashes), so we created an exception that uses a blob hash (ie. based on the raw block). We're actually busy refactoring that out into a more general purpose blob hash checkpoint system, partly for legibility, but also so we can use it in future if there is ever a need.",,12,xmr,t1_cpte8lk,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

If you have 1.23 bitcoin (or 1.23 monero) that should actually be broken up into three UTXO's... a UTXO of 1.00, a UTXO of 0.2, and a UTXO of 0.03. And if you decide to send me 0.03 BTC, you actually send me the relevant UTXO. You broadcast a transaction on the network that will look something like ""I send  following UTXO to MathAndFerrets, this UTXO right here!"" and you sign this message/cheque with the private key responsible for the 0.03 BTC. 

Whenever a miner hears about that transaction, they will comb through the blockchain and verify that the 0.03BTC you are trying to send to me has not yet been sent away to anyone else, and, if it's cool, they will bundle it into a block of other transactions that are also legitimate. A UTXO is a bookkeeping/computer science concept.

Second, short answer, stealth addresses still shield everyone, but only to the extent that bitcoin does so. And, as you may have seen, bitcoin isn't technically anonymous, because circumstantial forensic analysis of the blockchain can reveal information about a transaction. In fact, data mining essentially removes all anonymity from bitcoin. Nail one drug dealer who uses bitcoin and you nail all clients of theirs, even if those clients were ""smart"" and used a coin mixer, because coin mixing is NOT cryptographic security, it's a shell game.

Third is the hardest question and most fun.  A UTXO (unspent transaction output) is technically what you own when you own XMR or bitcoin. Your private key is the key that allows you to transmit that transaction output to someone else; once you broadcast your transaction on the network, everyone makes sure that UTXO has not yet been spent, and once that is accomplished, the receiver will get a new UTXO. In bitcoin, the old UTXO's ... dissipate or are deleted, or at least can be forgotten after awhile. In Monero, not so.

When you start talking ring sigs, things get more complicated than the messages above. The message being broadcast becomes something like ""One of the UTXOs from the set {0.03 BTC owned by cqm, 0.03 BTC owned by warren buffet, 0.03 BTC owned by bruce wayne}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC1093073. Furthermore, the image of the key used to sign this message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah."" (Key images are usually just hashes of the original key)

Now, when a miner hears the message, they can't really comb through the blockchain looking for whether or not cqm really owns the UTXO of 0.03 BTC to send to me. That's what they would do with BTC, but they can't do it with monero. After all, it's not even clear which of these UTXO's is being sent - is it cqm's, or Bruce Wayne's, or Warren Buffets?  The miner has no idea which member of the set is sending, and only knows the receiving address, not the receiver. However, the miner CAN comb through the blockchain and look for previous usages of the key image H3107u3830830blahblahblah, it's a nice, easy thing to check. If it has been used before, that's a double-spend. Things get more information-intensive because every time YOU hear about a transaction, you will scramble to check if you can access address ABC to see if the money was sent to you.

Anyway, the number of possible-sending individuals OTHER than you is the number of mix-ins. A transaction with mix-in = 0 has no one else mixed in, and so no anonymity. It looks like this:

""One of the UTXOs from the set {this UTXO owned by cqm right here}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC. Furthermore, the image of the key I will use to sign the message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah"" and, of course, it's clear to everyone watching that cqm sent the money.

Finally, how do chain reactions work?

Well, if, all of a sudden, the UTXO's owned by Bruce Wayne and Warren Buffet are NO LONGER AVAILABLE because they have been spent NON-anonymously, then every ring signature created using those as obfuscating mix-ins are no longer really ring-sigs, they're just normal sigs. I mean, you can tell ... ""hey, this sig says bruce wayne coulda signed it, but bruce wayne doesn't own this money anymore... so he's out... and Warren Buffet sent this money to the Bahamas... so he's out... this musta been cqm.""

True, but underdeveloped technologies that won't get improved due to complications of development ***also*** make awful currencies, because they won't stand the tests of time, and an ideal currency would store value, which implies that it stands the tests of time.

I do not believe that inference to be valid. Allowing the use of proper single-purpose addresses in no way forces all Monero transactions to be used for illicit purposes. Neither does the use of single-purpose addresses imply that something sinister is going on.

I am not advocating for Monero to be used for evil. I simply would prefer it to be a tool that can be used to gain as much privacy as reasonably possible.

In an ideal world, the payment ID addresses would be ""hardened"" somehow so they can't be picked apart.

The Red Cross can publish a regular Monero address. If single-purpose addresses happen to double as payment ID addresses, merchants will want to use those. People can hand out regular Monero addresses to relatives and acquaintances. The type of address shouldn't allow any kind of inference whether a transaction is evil or good.

In any case, let me give you one completely innocuous example for why I would like to be able to generate addresses more easily. I use different nicknames and email addresses for each website that requires me to register, such as various forums etc. Password managers allow this kind of thing to be done without becoming too painful. If I go and hand out the same address everywhere, my separated identities are suddenly tied together. Making a new wallet/account for each website is a lot more work than adding one more entry to a password manager.

Granted, I don't receive money in every place I visit, so I don't need quite as many wallets as I need nicknames and email addresses. :)",,1,,t1_cqniysn,t5_31hbr,,1429905293,,,,,,,,,,,

Up until the block 202612 attack the C code was ""fine for the moment"". Then there was a real attack that used an exploit that would've been caught in a refactor.

So the priorities shift, because what good is a GUI without a blockchain DB? And what good is a blockchain DB without multi-threaded verification? And what good is multi-threaded verification if an exploit exists in the low-level C code that needs to be refactored?

Just when we start in earnest down that road we have someone coming along claiming to have a ""coin killer"" exploit that [""under the right conditions will allow an attacker to steal your wallets and hijack your addresses""](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=786201.0). So priorities shift again, for what good is fixing exploits that exist in the low-level C code if our user's funds can be stolen?

And now, after wasting time re-analysing all of that we're working our way back up the chain of ""stuff that is both urgent and important""...but I can guarantee that something else will come along that will force us to re-evaluate priorities.

Also, we never said we are underfunded *right now*, we said that funding would be an issue in future. We (the core team) are spending our own funds, and we're fine with that, because having more funds *will not* equate to us being able to do anything faster. The reason is simple: there are precious few people on the planet that can quickly grok the deeper cryptographic issues in play, so when something makes us re-evaluate priorities ALL the members of the core team and all the contributors focus inwardly. Those that can't grok the deeper cryptographic issues also can't do anything else, because nobody is available to provide guidance and assistance with any of their efforts.

We had a discussion early on about decentralised governance within Monero, and decided there was no ""good fit"" for any system just yet. The best we can do is take the voting / funding of enhancements away from our control (via the Forum Funding System), and add some other bits to make code and protocol governance more ""decentralised"" (more on that soon).

But we currently are, and will remain for the time being, the ""benevolent dictator for life"". This is a model that has served Linux well, and we believe it is best suited to making the hard decisions required in a cryptocurrency (and, more specifically, to make decisions as a core team that may not be popular with many people, such as when we decided *not* to change the emission curve).

If, in future, the community decides we're doing a bad job they will replace us. If, in future, we find a better decentralised governance system we will switch to that. None of this is set in stone, but it is ""for the foreseeable future"" or ""until something better comes along.

&gt; Right now the devs are in accord, and all is well. What if in seven years a major rift happens as a result of government intervention into the Monero project. How will we determine who has the 'right' to update the Monero client?

I spoke to this on the Monero forum, so here you go:

""Let's pretend we were facing the same situation as Bitcoin, with a polarised decision that has to be made. It's very unlikely that 1 of the 7 core team members could act like Gavin, because the division would be clear (not so with Bitcoin where there is this misconception that ""only Blockstream devs disagree with Gavin"" or ""everyone that matters agrees with Gavin"" when meanwhile, back at the ranch, he's the only one of the 5 core maintainers that wants the 20mb limit right now). But even so, let's imagine it's 3 vs 3 on the decision with 1 abstain, and the community is torn.

Now here's the clincher: *with planned hard forks we could very easily put the code in and then measure full node uptake over 6 months*. Since the code only kicks in after the 6 month window *and* the node observes a sufficient percentage of blocks on the new version, it simply wouldn't enable that code if there is not sufficient uptake. This could be modified to be both % of mined blocks + % of connected nodes for the sake of fairness. We therefore let the miners and users decide, and we can always nuke that code in the next hard fork update.""

&gt; Perhaps if you are going to create a social framework around Monero (and scheduled hard forks are definitely a social frame work) then a constitution needs to be drawn up as well.

There will be something like this drawn up, that is a discussion we'll open up soon.

&gt; And like it or not, after a certain point (four years sounds good) you are going to need to have a system in place for elections and appointments to the board of developers.

That's exactly what I was alluding to with the BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) thing - we probably won't increase it at all, unless we really have to, and then we'll handle that within the core team. It is very unlikely that there will be so many others who come along that understand decentralised security systems that they become integral and have to sit on the core team (plus not everyone wants to have that responsibility). That is not to say we won't be transparent, but I think that it is best to avoid too formalised a structure there. That having been said, there are peripheral organisations, such as MEW, that can have all sorts of formal structure and that have our ear. Similarly, we could create something akin to the LSB (Linux Standard Base) which provides even more formal control over implementations and interaction mechanisms.

&gt; I know that sounds dire, but what we are trying to do is take humans out of the equation, right? So we should be very cautious about rushing to put humans back into it, even if it's a necessary and rational move.

You're trying to take humans out at the wrong layer.

Open source projects absolutely need guidance and decision making. With something like Monero it's even more important that there's a centralised structure to meet the paradigm that journalists and companies inevitably expect. Having this centralised ""benevolent dictator"" structure is completely fine, as long as we aren't precluding others from making a meaningful contribution (more on that soon).

Where the human element should be taken out is in the network consensus level. Right now Bitcoin is getting this wrong. If Bitcoin needs to hard fork they have to first convince everyone to upgrade. With the combination of the core team as benevolent dictators and the 6-month hard fork rollover we can instead push out a fork and then spend 6 months observing the uptake and acting accordingly.

Oh and before there are any thoughts given to us being in ""control"" there are two things that should be born in mind:

1. We are in control as stewards of the project. That's the nature of the situation, and it won't change. We deserve that control, partly because we are not complete morons and are doing a decent job, but also because we've sunk more time, money, and energy into Monero than anyone else.

2. We inherited that role from thankful_for_today, so we're VERY cognisant that we can be ousted from the community and a new group can take it over. This means that, whilst we are capable of making firm decisions, we are also able to step back and reverse decisions where they aren't met with broad community acceptance.

&gt; if 6-month hard forks become a thing, two competing groups in the future will both fight for their right to update the client

But in the end nodes and miners will decide. Two competing groups would actually make it easier - we could host both downloads on getmonero.org and then miners would be able to more easily select the one they want to vote for:)

Also let's not forget that this structure is not necessarily ""for life"". We will do this until it is no longer workable, and then we'll do something else. The 6 month rolling fork means that we can easily change the software, and changing the systems and core team is also not insurmountable.",,10,xmr,t1_crp8t9s,t5_31hbr,moderator,1432933724,,,,,,,,,,,

I do recognize the usefulness of the dictator approach, and in fact, a benevolent and wise dictator is the best form of government or management.  
  
The problems occur when that dictator is replaced with someone less capable that still wields the same power.  
  
As you go forward, please understand that the community isn't hoping and predicting that Monero will reach a Dogecoin-esque 100 million dollar market cap.  We (and I'm sure you) are envisioning that if everything works out the way we think, Monero's ""market cap"" will easily surpass the trillions.  This means that governments *will* get involved, and will be very interested in exactly who is pulling the strings behind a dominant form of money on Earth, and how they are doing it.  (though I'm sure you have already forseen this + other tinfoil conspiracies).   
  
Second, as you probably already know and have seen in systems, they are highly malleable in the beginning and become more resistant to change as they grow.  Governments, human brains, information networks, etc.  Monero will be no different.  
  
Please plan that it will be trivial to hard fork six months from now, and (even if scheduled) a major pain-in-the-ass six years from now.  
  
Perhaps it doesn't even bear saying, and don't take this the wrong way: you devs are doing the thankless hard lifting and amassing unimaginable talent and effort together for this project.  But precisely because armchair speculator/critics like us are not immersed in the trenches, we have a unique perspective on the matter.  
  
That being said, it's **essential** that the team focus on the most crucial changes early, and get them in place.  Fun and fancy can come later, but key protocol changes have to happen in the first few hard forks to alleviate exponential suffering later.  **It also means the next 24 months of software development will be the most crucial in the entire history of Monero** (which could be a very long time).   
  
*You have roughly two years to establish the most essential parts of one of the most important protocols in our species' history*.  That is fucking awesome, and I'm sure the gravity of that task weighs firmly on each of you.  I wish I could contribute more, but enthusiasm and gab are my gifts, not code and cryptography.  
  

  
It would seem as if you already understand this though, as you have a well designed road map of priorities, and the fact that the GUI has been currently sacrificed in favor of other, under-the-hood items bodes well.  
  
Keep doing a great job, and please continue to think about the long term ramifications of every decision you make.  You hold in your hands a similar power and responsibility that the fabled ""forefathers of America"" held, as they designed the US Government from the ground up.

I think 1-5 have been answered thoroughly, so I'll leave them be. I'd like to add something to number 6; a cryptonote sidechain. 

That being said, I firmly believe that, at this moment, Monero is by far the best long term speculative (alt)bet in crypto. Extremely speculative, yes, but best risk/reward. Because of: 

* excellent technical properties
* proven and highly relevant marketniche
* great devteam - smartest guys on the block
* wealthy and generous community, both intellectually and in btc	

  
My cryptfolio almost entirely consists of bitcoin/monero, currently around a 50/50 split. I keep gradually but steadily increasing my xmr-holdings.

Make sure to take all the time you need in order to make an informed decision. There's no need to rush if you eventually decide to buy some. Emission is still around [10.5 xmr/min so roughly 15k a day](http://chainradar.com/xmr/chart). With monero still being off-radar to a lot of bitcoiners this is high enough to supress any exuberance eventually.

We have and will keep experiencing highs but overall you can accumulate fairly easily and steadily. It is one of the more liquid altcoins, as you have probably seen.

Alice leaks an entire transaction? Including cryptographic proof thereof? Or does Alice accidentally Tweet ""paid 100 XMR for cocaine to 4ABCDEFG""? If she's that dumb Monero isn't going to protect her, definitely not by inconveniencing the crap out of everyone.

&gt; This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have.

So this is how Monero works: we provide the best privacy we can whilst not making Monero a complete pain to use, and still making things like optional and voluntary transparency available.

There's a level of corner cases we simply *can't* prevent, including things like Ed25519 being compromised by the NSA, or the FBI buying up 83% of the output set, or Alice putting her transaction history online.

Of course, if any of these become an actual / recurrent problem we'll see if we can mitigate them, and if not we'll raise the red flag. But our main aim with Monero is, first and foremost, to provide something that is *useful and usable* whilst still retaining as much privacy as is reasonably possible.

Monero is not trying to compete with Zerocash. In 20 or 30 years when Zerocash's cryptography has been more thoroughly vetted then I fully expect it make Monero redundant. Between now and then, though, our aim is not to deal in absolutes and not to preemptively cover every edge case at the cost of usability.

I remain unconvinced that effectively breaking the viewkey functionality and overcomplicating the wallet system provides anything more than absolutely peripheral benefits whilst preventing very few privacy-breaking edge cases. Also such a change is largely pointless unless everyone is using it, and I can guarantee someone will just release a forked / patched version that disables the functionality because logic.",,1,xmr,t1_cqnkm50,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

A proper post mortem of the attack is what [MRL-0002, ""Counterfeiting via Merkle Tree Exploits within Virtual Currencies Employing the CryptoNote Protocol""](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0002.pdf), is all about, and is a worthy read.

The long and the short of it is: the tree-hash.c code that is responsible for transaction hashes within a block had a bug in it whereby any hashes for more than 512 transactions would be computed using uninitialised memory (ie. with garbage). So the attacker slowly built up the dynamic block size limit until they were able to create a 72kb block with 514 transactions in it. Because the hash on transaction 513 and 514 in that block was computed using some random bits of memory on the mining pool's node at the time, a fork occurred. The network eventually chose one of the forks.

We could have patched the bug and carried on, as the network resolved the fork and was fine within 30 minutes of it occurring, but there was a problem with that: nodes stuck on the old fork still existed (in fact I spotted one still around the other day, and this attack occurred in September, 2014). When syncing up and receiving blocks from peers these ""stuck"" nodes are fine, *until you get to block 202612*, when suddenly it sends you a block that you cannot verify. We also found that there were some instances of nodes on the correct fork, but their transaction hashes for transactions 513/514 on block 202612 disagreed. This opened up the possibility for the attacker to spend those funds later on (or even for them to be used in a ring signature) which would cause another explosion.

Thus we had to add in a checkpoint for 202612, except that the block hash is over the block header only (ie. disregarding the actual transaction hashes), so we created an exception that uses a blob hash (ie. based on the raw block). We're actually busy refactoring that out into a more general purpose blob hash checkpoint system, partly for legibility, but also so we can use it in future if there is ever a need.",,12,xmr,t1_cpte8lk,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing. To make matters worse, we spent the first 6 months with completely mixed objectives, whilst still coming to grips with cryptography and a codebase we were unfamiliar with, whilst still patching a never-ending list of rapidly emerging issues, whilst getting to know *each other* as members of the core team, whilst still having to work to make a living.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets. So we start researching a bloom-filter style viewkey lookup, then we get hammered on ""breaking exploits"" from BCX. So we start figuring out what the exploit could-possibly-maybe-not-sure-who-knows-be, then we actually do get attacked. So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

This is a massive mindfuck to bitcoiners and the general public because you just basically said your coin is equal to bitcoin in terms of value, and because you are playing fair, you are inviting them aboard and giving them prior notice.

And as rpiella is fond of saying, even in stocks and commodities you have to hedge, and with speculative tech like this it makes sense that bitcoiners should have to hedge a little in rival technologies.  
  
So I can see both sides of the story.  I think deep down, I'm in Monero to see it reach #2 status, with a market cap of 10% that of bitcoin.  
  
If a zero coin or a quantum coin comes out, I would definitely hedge in those, no matter where Monero took me.

For each transaction, build an intersection of transactions from which the ring signature participants are sourced. Your ""2)"" should not make this more difficult. ""1)"" is only relevant when outputs are partially spent.

Example:  
I have outputs O^1, O^2, O^3, O^4, O^5, O^6, all generated in Transaction T^1 and want to use O^1, O^2, O^3.  
I randomly choose matching outputs for mixing: M^{1,1}, M^{1,2}, M^{2,1}, M^{2,2}, M^{3,1}, M^{3,2} from transactions T1{2..7}.  
I generate three ring signatures: RS^i = RS( O^i, M^{i,1}, M^{i,2} ), i in {1,2,3}  
I spend each output fully, without change.

The attacker takes RS^i and determines the sets of transactions: ST^1 = { T^1, T^2, T^3 }, ST^2 = { T^1, T^4, T^5 }, ST^3 = { T^1, T^6, T^7 }  
Candidates for the source transaction are then: Intersect( ST^1, ST^2, ST^3 ) = T^1  
The bigger the pool of outputs that mixing outputs are selected from, the lower the probability that the intersection will contain a transaction by chance, as long as there is more than one output in the transaction.

I also send a transaction using the other three outputs.  
Using the same approach, the attacker determines, that it also is linked to T^1 .  
The attacker now can link these two transactions back to T^1 , mark all outputs in T^1 as spent and eliminate them from analysis for future ring signatures.

This approach can possibly be generalized by building intersections over time slices or blocks instead of transactions, so splitting the transfer in two transactions is of limited usefulness.

If a sufficiently high number of outputs are used (let's say 8) and they stem from only few transactions (let's say 2), an attacker could also attempt to link these transactions, by swapping out Intersect for a less strict selection function (e.g. count which transactions occur more than #outputs/3 times).

If you receive few payments (let's say one, for argument's sake) before spending all XMR your wallet, this analysis will be enough to link all transactions you make back together. Change admittedly makes it harder, but if it is used in transactions to which this type of analysis also applies, it isn't a panacea.

I remain unconvinced that this isn't an issue.

FWIW, my ideas for mitigation would be:

1) If available, use outputs for transactions, which have not been generated with the same transaction or within a short time of each other.

2) If the wallet has to choose ""related"" outputs, also choose ""related"" outputs for mixing. This feels a bit iffy, but it shouldn't make matters worse than they are. Even if this is done rarely, it should be enough to make this kind of analysis unfeasible.

Edit: 2) May be even more effective if occassionally ""related"" outputs are chosen for mixing, even when no ""related"" outputs are used regularly.

As before, if this is all based on a misunderstanding, I would be most happy to be enlightened.

&gt; (By the way, Monero doesn't just always do 1.23 = 1 + 0.2 + 0.03, it also does other combinations like 0.6+0.4+0.2+0.002+0.001 etc.).

Nice. That's good to know.

He isn't talking about opsec, he's misunderstanding how Monero works (I suspect).

For OP's benefit: a Monero address is *completely* different to a Bitcoin style address, it has both view and spend public keys serialised and not hashed, so your public keys are completely visible by anyone who has your address. Since output ""destinations"" are computed from those keys, but the computation includes some random data, a ""destination"" has no visible link to an address, which means addresses can and should be reused.

&gt; On the off chance of a hit, the LEO's LEA subpoenas a bunch of exchanges for any business done with that address and receives enough identifying information to arrest the seller

I agree that this is a risk, but that's bad opsec on behalf of the person and good police work on behalf of the LEA. Monero isn't trying to encourage lawlessness, but it is trying to provide reasonable privacy by default whilst still provide opt-in transparency (public or private) via the viewkey.

This is also why simplewallet doesn't keep a record of the *addresses* you pay, since they're largely inconsequential except as a record-keeping tool. We may add this functionality as an option to be specified on account creation, but then, like many things, it's a convenience that sacrifices some privacy.

Exchanges, too, aren't obligated to keep the payout address as long as they keep a record of the actual transaction and which outputs were to the recipient (ie. which outputs weren't change outputs), although I doubt we'll ever convince exchanges to change.

The bottom line here is that being ""absolutely"" private with Monero does and should require very little effort, whereas with Bitcoin it requires a great deal of effort. Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked) or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction. Having a reusable address means that for each account you control you only backup once, only have one mnemonic to memorise, you can use OpenAlias to link to it, and you have one viewkey that you can give to the tax man or your accountant or whatever.

At some point we may create some guidelines for more ""absolute"" privacy opsec, but we DON'T want to encourage specific use-cases, especially of the illicit sort.",,3,xmr,t1_cqmybz1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I do recognize the usefulness of the dictator approach, and in fact, a benevolent and wise dictator is the best form of government or management.  
  
The problems occur when that dictator is replaced with someone less capable that still wields the same power.  
  
As you go forward, please understand that the community isn't hoping and predicting that Monero will reach a Dogecoin-esque 100 million dollar market cap.  We (and I'm sure you) are envisioning that if everything works out the way we think, Monero's ""market cap"" will easily surpass the trillions.  This means that governments *will* get involved, and will be very interested in exactly who is pulling the strings behind a dominant form of money on Earth, and how they are doing it.  (though I'm sure you have already forseen this + other tinfoil conspiracies).   
  
Second, as you probably already know and have seen in systems, they are highly malleable in the beginning and become more resistant to change as they grow.  Governments, human brains, information networks, etc.  Monero will be no different.  
  
Please plan that it will be trivial to hard fork six months from now, and (even if scheduled) a major pain-in-the-ass six years from now.  
  
Perhaps it doesn't even bear saying, and don't take this the wrong way: you devs are doing the thankless hard lifting and amassing unimaginable talent and effort together for this project.  But precisely because armchair speculator/critics like us are not immersed in the trenches, we have a unique perspective on the matter.  
  
That being said, it's **essential** that the team focus on the most crucial changes early, and get them in place.  Fun and fancy can come later, but key protocol changes have to happen in the first few hard forks to alleviate exponential suffering later.  **It also means the next 24 months of software development will be the most crucial in the entire history of Monero** (which could be a very long time).   
  
*You have roughly two years to establish the most essential parts of one of the most important protocols in our species' history*.  That is fucking awesome, and I'm sure the gravity of that task weighs firmly on each of you.  I wish I could contribute more, but enthusiasm and gab are my gifts, not code and cryptography.  
  

  
It would seem as if you already understand this though, as you have a well designed road map of priorities, and the fact that the GUI has been currently sacrificed in favor of other, under-the-hood items bodes well.

I always glossed over the concept that cryptocurrencies are a ""ledger"" - being that I have never used a ledger. As such, the key for me to understand how the blockchain actually works is that ledgers are always ""written to""... a concept that was apparently odd for me, I assume due to generational effects of never balancing a checkbook (computers have always done it for me) and always working with digital file storage, in which, for the most part, you can rewrite anything or delete anything etc. 

So there is no ""debit"" that occurs.... you just own a particular bunch of lines on the ledger. Furthermore, there are no ""tokens"" as I originally imagined them.

Lets assume you just joined Monero, and your name is Bob, - you made a new address, and someone sent you 12 monero, and you've been lucky mining, so you've got 5 monero from mining. On the ledger, there's a line that says ""Bob owns 12 monero!"" on block 500. And some other lines associated with your mining rewards, which probably came in tiny bits, so there are 5 lines of ""Bob owns 1 monero!"" in blocks 501 - 506

So when the wallet software scans the blockchain, it sees all these lines and adds them up to tell you ""You have 17 monero""

Now, if you want to go and send Alice 5 monero, this is NOT what happens, and is what I thought happened until I finally had it explained enough to get it - 

The protocol/wallet/blackbox/whatever subtracts 5 monero from your total account, and adds 5 monero to Alice's account. 

Instead, what actually happens is the protocol/wallet/blackbox scans the blockchain, looking for your lines. It finds the line ""bob has 12 monero"" and the 5 lines of ""bob owns 1 monero"". Based on a variety of factors (especially for monero with mixins etc), the wallet software will go ""I'm going to use these lines for this transaction"". For the sake of simplicity, lets just say it uses the ""Bob has 12 monero"" line.

So in a new line in the ledger, a new line is written that essentially means ""We're going to use that line up there that says 'Bob has 12 Monero'. We're then going to make a new line that says ""Bob has 7 monero"" and also make a new line that says ""Alice has 5 monero"". 

So now when the wallet software scans the blockchain (after this transaction has been accepted by the network), it will still see the original ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line, but then it will see the new transaction that occured that used that line, so it no longer counts it in the total. That line has been ""used up"", or in blockchain talk, turned into an input. 

But its important to realize that the ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line gets turned into an input by the new transaction. In reality (in the database, the blockchain), the line in block 500 still exists that says ""bob has 12 monero!"". But the new line in block 510 essentially says ""That line in block 500 should be ignored, and these new lines should be used instead - the ones that say Bob has 7 Monero and Alice has 5 Monero"".

Well, thats my attempt at explaining outputs and inputs. How'd I do?",,3,,t1_crmqp82,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

But you haven't spun one that's feasible yet. I'm not trying to be antagonistic, so hear me out:)

My address is public and known, I posted it above. I use it as my withdrawal address on Monero exchanges, on ShapeShift.io, and (presumably) on some future eBay-like market when I sell my Star Wars Episode I Stap and Battledroid teaser toy. All of those entities can be subpoenaed and they can reveal all of my ""earnings"".

*But that's all that an attacker can gleam* -

&gt; Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming and outgoing transactions

This is where you're misunderstanding. The viewkey reveals my incoming transactions, but NOT my outgoing transactions. So *at best* an attacker can determine the source of some of my income, but that's where it ends.

The viewkey isn't a magic key that reveals all transactions, it's a magic key that reveals all outputs you control. Right now those outputs can be spent at mixin 0, which would reveal that the output is spent/unspent, but once [MRL-0004](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf) has been implemented that will no longer be the case.

So with this information let's go back to your example:

&gt; If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

&gt; ... and that means Alice is exposed by Bob's approach to single-purpose wallets.

In order to know that Alice has been paying Bob they'd have to ask Alice, not Bob. There's no way for Bob to prove where the funds he received came from, he can only prove that he has control over them. Only Alice can prove ownership of the transactions she initiated.

So Alice is exposed because LEA asked her for her data and she complied.

Similarly, if LEA instead approach Bob, they can see ""Bob has received a string of payments"", but not who the payments are from.

Obviously LEA can beat the information out of both Bob and Alice, but Monero is not a solution to [rubber-hose cryptanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis).

&gt; By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues.

Monero is far from mature, so taken in its current state this is an unsolvable problem: if an advertiser/insurer/enemy knows your email address they can go and offer Poloniex a bucket load of money for your data, and come up with some idea of your personal Monero holdings. But when Monero is mature there will be too many moving targets for that, and knowing your ""net worth"" isn't worth the expenditure.

Thought I’d let you know about a few tools we developed for Altcoin Communities.

Firstly the comprehensive price index on the home page (bravenewcoin.com). 

Click on the arrow to the right of any coin to see a nice dropdown chart. 

Then check out Embeddable tickers page here http://bravenewcoin.com/tickers/

Just select whichever coin you want and copy/paste the code for that coin, displayed below, into your website design. 

We also have a coin profile page here http://bravenewcoin.com/coins/monero which acts like an info hub. 

We collect data from over 50 exchanges in over 23 trading pairs for over 65 coins. We have worked tirelessly for months securing out methodology, data processing and infrastructure. Our data is at a level where we can start supplying government or corporates with custom feeds. 

Our production schedule for August includes: Comprehensive Bitcoin Directory, zerohedge.com style community news section, Profiles for all Exchanges, profiles for hundreds of Crypto-Currency related companies.

Production Schedule for mid August to Dec includes: Comprehensive portfolio management tools and much needed Quickbooks, Fastbooks, MYOB &amp; Xero accounting software plugins. 

Lastly we have an Android App available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Techemy.BraveNewCoin 

The iOS version is coming in the next 2 weeks. An update is coming for Android in the next 2 weeks that includes being able to ‘favorite’ coins, having the coins summary on the home screen click-able to the data page and sorting of home screen by volume or other metrics. 

Check us out and any feedback is welcome

There's a possibility that this is the last time we'll see Monero at the 0.005-ish level, it's already at number 4 on the Mintpal voting list 7 days after being added (through a combination of heavy voting and paid-for votes by supporters of Monero). *If* the price corrects before it goes on Mintpal I doubt it'll correct very far down. It will definitely spike hard when it hits Mintpal and then correct back down (new exchange syndrome), but depending on how high it goes I doubt we'll see it drop below 0.008 after listing on Mintpal.

That having been said, don't forget that everyone buying Monero at this very early stage is buying speculatively.

If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

As I mentioned in my reply to Hizonner just now, that's ONLY true if addresses are one-time or secret. Reusable addresses are actually a protection, because if Edward Snowden's address is public knowledge then your knowing it or having it on your phone cannot be an offence (not without LEA or whoever grossly overplaying their hand).

&gt; But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

It is just obfuscation, in a sense, but it's also not *that* weak, because an exchange (for instance) will then have a different ""address"" for each person, so it's very unlikely they'll ever publish their address without a payment ID.

To illustrate at a very basic, unstealthed level: let's say my address is ABC. Let's say Poloniex's address is DEF. Poloniex will no longer tell me to ""make a payment to DEF using payment ID 714"", they'll say ""make a payment to DEF714"". Your deposit address on Poloniex will be DEF837. Bob's address will be DEF419. Even if you are proficient and you can unpack the address to ""DEF"" searching for it won't reveal anything because Poloniex will never have publicly listed just that address for payment.

Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

&gt; At least in my case, I'm not asking to force everybody to use single-purpose addresses. I just would like an easier way of producing them that doesn't force me to incur extra fees or write my own wallet.

We don't really have the funding or manpower to build something like this out, so you'll either have to write it yourself or wait for some time in the far future when we are able to commit resources to it.",,0,xmr,t1_cqnfmzz,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

In my honest view, the only reason left to develop/continue developing on Bitcoin is so that it gives leeway for other cryptocurrencies to rise to prominence, given that Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. All those things that you said Bitcoin provides, is provided by 3rd parties, and are centralized.

I'm sorry, but Satoshi said it himself about how Bitcoin's core features will never change. Therefore Bitcoin will eventually die out, it's simply too ""stone-age"", and it is in no way, shape, or form, a currency(It entirely lacks fungibility, something even Credit Cards have).

I have stopped using Bitcoin entirely except for ""HODLING"", because it makes no sense to use it.

There's a possibility that this is the last time we'll see Monero at the 0.005-ish level, it's already at number 4 on the Mintpal voting list 7 days after being added (through a combination of heavy voting and paid-for votes by supporters of Monero). *If* the price corrects before it goes on Mintpal I doubt it'll correct very far down.

There are two aspects to this. At the moment, when you create a new wallet it generates two keys: your ""spend"" key and your ""view"" key. Now because this is unfinished software, the ""view"" key is shown once on creation and never again (we're fixing that:)

The view key (public key) is attached to transactions and would allow someone to view transactions you have made. The tooling will exist soon that will allow you to publish your public key and will allow someone else to use it on monerochain.info or other blockchain explorers and see all of your transactions and your balance. Moreover, we will add tooling that will allow you to publish the 1-time key *for a specific transaction*, thus allowing confirmation of the specifics of that transaction by an exchange or other party.

All of this is possible for any transactions that have already been made, so it's not like we have to make breaking changes to the code or hard-fork to support this, but we do need to add tooling so you can extract the relevant info from simplewallet (and other wallet tools) and then provide RPC calls and other information so the blockchain explorers can add tooling to view this information:)",,4,xmr,t1_ci1dhk1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; Nowhere is this more apparent than in the privacy of man’s finances. A simple subpoena reveals what he earned, how he earned it, and when he bought that pregnancy test because the girl he’s sleeping with was worried. His government can and will give his savings a haircut for no apparent reason. And without any cause, his bank may deem it necessary to shut his account, complaining loudly that he is too “high risk” for them to service.

&gt; Today we say no more. No more shall the courts of the land cajole or force us into revealing the most intimate details of our finances. No more shall a government or a rule of law take what we have worked for with our hands. No more shall a corporate institution run by fat cats choose whether or not we are able to transact. Today we take back what is ours. Today we choose to be our own bank. Today we choose Monero.

If I buy an ounce of gold and store it securely, I know that -- barring some radical change in our understanding of Physics -- it's still going to be there, still going to be more or less as scarce as it currently is, still be as atomic-scale fungible (only one long-lived isotope!), still be as hard to destroy, etc, etc.

Math is *even better* than Physics, but cryptocurrencies aren't founded entirely on math; they're based on a consensus of which mathematical rules ought to govern the chain's progression.

For me and other long-term value investors the community's commitment to abiding by the original mathematical terms, laid out *in advance*, is a major source of value.  Monero can adopt whatever policies it likes, but please be aware that deviation from rules laid out in advance *and a stated intention or willingness to do so* does actually destroy value in our eyes.  Maybe that means Monero is the wrong coin for me.

If so, okay.

But like a lot of other people I find that there is a lot that ""smells right"" about Monero and what's happening around it (except the whole batshit-crazy bytecoin origin thing, but hey I guess some legend adds to the mystique).  This proposal to change the rules every six months -- and worse, to vest the power to do so in the hands of any particular group after what we saw go down with the BatshitCoinFoundation... it was pretty jarring.

Of course, not everything has worked out for either coin. LTC has trouble justifying its existence and use while PPC has to deal with centralized checkpointing and hoarding. There are no direct parallels, but this can help non-technical people get a sense of the difference.

There are two aspects to this. At the moment, when you create a new wallet it generates two keys: your ""spend"" key and your ""view"" key. Now because this is unfinished software, the ""view"" key is shown once on creation and never again (we're fixing that:)

The view key (public key) is attached to transactions and would allow someone to view transactions you have made. The tooling will exist soon that will allow you to publish your public key and will allow someone else to use it on monerochain.info or other blockchain explorers and see all of your transactions and your balance. Moreover, we will add tooling that will allow you to publish the 1-time key *for a specific transaction*, thus allowing confirmation of the specifics of that transaction by an exchange or other party.

All of this is possible for any transactions that have already been made, so it's not like we have to make breaking changes to the code or hard-fork to support this, but we do need to add tooling so you can extract the relevant info from simplewallet (and other wallet tools) and then provide RPC calls and other information so the blockchain explorers can add tooling to view this information:)",,4,xmr,t1_ci1dhk1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

No actually its not. Bytecoin is more profitable according to the [Minergate](https://minergate.com/calc) calculator. 

1000h/s gets you 77760 BCN or 1.563 XMR

So XMR profitability is 1.563 * 0.0031 (current XMR exchange rate - low) = 0.0048453 BTC

and BCN profitability is 77760 BCN * 0.00000007 (current BCN exchange rate - also low) = 0.0054432

* for one, we wanted to get the blockchain out of RAM (at least optionally) because it's starting to max out RAM on people's systems; at worst this means those people can't run monero at all, at best this means a lot of disk thrashing because swap space.
* secondly, we wanted to refactor the blockchain class in the codebase to separate the storage logic from the validation/access logic.  This way we can more easily support many different ways of storing the blockchain (including putting it all back in RAM, if someone wants to).

It's been a long time coming mainly because it's a very complicated refactor (tearing apart, understanding, and restructuring 2k lines of code is...fun).

This is uninteresting information. Things you are ignoring:

1) [Change](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change). Sum of inputs = sum of outputs + fees. But every denominated amount is contained in its own address so you don't know how much was sent back. Say I have a $20 bill and owe you $9.23. On the blockchain this looks like $20 was broken up into a bunch of little amounts, but no one can tell how much went to you and how much went back to me.

(By the way, Monero doesn't just always do 1.23 = 1 + 0.2 + 0.03, it also does other combinations like 0.6+0.4+0.2+0.002+0.001 etc.).

2) Aside from the ring signatures used to receive 123.456 XMR and to send it out, other users are performing ring signatures that may use your outputs. In the intervening time between your send and receive, your outputs could have been mixed with other users. In fact, even after you send it to a new wallet, your 20, 3, 0.4, etc. are forever in the blockchain getting mixed into transactions. It can never be known when even one of these denominated amounts was truly spent.

With these two points, it's a pretty big stretch to try to connect any two transactions by appealing to human psychology. You could maybe try that argument in a network with a 100 users. Any larger and credibility quickly goes down.

Of course, you could just render this psychological appeal moot by breaking your 123.456 XMR in 2 sends to your new wallet (they're unlinkable because of one-time addresses). I personally wouldn't even bother. :P",,1,xmr,t1_ck4uj7c,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a massive mindfuck to bitcoiners and the general public because you just basically said your coin is equal to bitcoin in terms of value, and because you are playing fair, you are inviting them aboard and giving them prior notice.  
  
On the other hand, yeah, starting a new ledger sucks, but with all due respect to Satoshi, a ledger began in 2014 (when many more know about crypto) that opens up mining to everyone vs. Becoming an ASIC race *is* fairer.  
  
And as rpiella is fond of saying, even in stocks and commodities you have to hedge, and with speculative tech like this it makes sense that bitcoiners should have to hedge a little in rival technologies.

Like any new technology, I understand the first of any kind is likely an alpha test. A new concept will go through all of the rigorous tests that society can throw at it, from practicality, ease of use, exploitability, manipulation, spoofing/knock-off and general acceptance. Being that Bitcoin is a ‘currency’ and also acts as a ‘stock’, I figured that it was subject to the whims of the global market, making it even more susceptible to long-term failure or obsolescence. From early implementation, I was concerned that large investors or organizations with access to large computing infrastructure would corner the market or ramp up the difficulty. I watched small investors purchase GPU mining equipment, invest in ASICS and then cloud mining until the difficulty was hardly worth the effort. We then saw companies go bankrupt, investors lose their money and scammers cash out. When Litecoin and Altcoins in general started to appear, I believed the second phase of Bitcoin was starting and eventually markets would start shifting towards other coins that were still small-scale minable. I still didn’t see any noticeable traits that made Altcoins stand apart from Bitcoins, they were just clones with minor changes to the mining process, but overall they were all macro-minable. The same problem was still apparent; centralization was still possible. I have been waiting for a solid ASIC-hard coin, with privacy features and a non-Meme-Joke/immature image to invest in. I personally believe that decentralization, privacy, ease-of-use, professional brand and a dedicated DevTeam are the key features needed for a long-term successful coin. Most of the other coins with these traits were all deemed as scam-coins or were pre-mined. I have been waiting for a CPU coin that has all of the previously mentioned features without the flaws and that is actively working towards making it easier for the commoner to participate in the market. So far, Monero is number 1 on my list with all of these traits and current promises of continued development for the traits I believe that will make a coin successful in the long-term. While most Bitcoin investors believe that as difficulty becomes out of reach for most people, the price will go up; I personally believe that people will start pulling their money from Bitcoin and investing in something that continues to create currency over a long-term. Scarcity alone doesn’t create demand. Activity and perceived value creates demand. Scarcity is only valued when alternative options are not present. Cryptocurrency clearly will always have more options, therefore believing that scarcity will perpetually drive up demand is a joke. The only reason it’s still dominant is because of it’s level of acceptance. When another coin can achieve the same acceptance, Bitcoin will have nothing left working for it other than it’s PR tenure, which is also due to expire when a better solution arises. 

tl;dr Monero didn’t find me, I found Monero. True decentralization is the key to successful long-term open source currency.

As a first stop, I'll reiterate [my post from Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.msg8246348#msg8246348) on creating a secure offline wallet:

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.
4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.
9. Write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed.
10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.
11. Switch off the computer, remove the battery if there is one, and leave it physically off for a few hours.

There you go - the wallet you've created was created in RAM, and the digital files are now lost forever. If some magical hacker manages to somehow get the data, they will lack the long password to open it. If you need to receive payments, you have the address, and you have the view key if needed. If you need access to it, you have your 24 word seed, and you can now write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever. Then write a bunch of extra love letters. That way, if your deposit box is ever discovered, it'll be disregarded as unimportant love letters.

**Creating a secure, online wallet**

Create a new wallet on your computer, using a reasonably secure password or passphrase, and write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed. You can transact using your wallet, knowing that if the wallet files are stolen it is extremely unlikely that an attacker will be able to brute-force your password (wallet files are quite heavily encrypted).

The same process of securing your 24 word seed as with the offline wallet applies: write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever.

&gt; ""True privacy"" - that's cute. It certainly has better obfuscation, but obfuscation is not perfect privacy - it simply makes it much more difficult to de-obfuscate.
   
Let me rephrase: the best anonymity that can be found in the cryptocoins world! I personally disagree with the word ""obfuscation"". Obfuscation means something like coinjoin to me. With ring signatures, it's just maths that make it foundamentally intracable, not just a big noise to obfuscate the signal. There is mathematically no way to know which of the N inputs is the actual sender, at the single transaction level.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt;  One of very few coins to compliment bitcoin rather than compete.   

&gt; What does this even mean?   
   
""compliment"" is meant to be ""complement"". Didn't catch this, not a native speaker sorry.   
That means most altcoins claim to be better than bitcoin. The hype
around them is all about this, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not.
Take the most valued one by far, litecoin: it is all about ""having
faster block confirmation"", and ""resistant to asic"" (later rephrased
in better CPU/GPU/ASIC ratio, when the original statement was not true
anymore). The claim is just to do better than bitcoin, nothing
less. Which is ridiculous, with such negligeable changes nobody's
going to overcome bitcoin network effect and this is crystal clear
since years.  The cryptonote tech is not something better than
bitcoin, it is just *completely* different. Use bitcoin if you want
full transparency, use a cryptonote coin if you want full privacy.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Impossible to examine block chain for tracking funds.

&gt; There is a big difference between ""extremely difficult"" and ""impossible""

I'm not going to arg on that, you're right in theory. Let me rephrase
it so it is not ambiguous: cryptonote coins are by *very* far the most
difficult to track. I say *very*, because it happens at the math
level, not by just mixing as it was done previously (cf DRK). ""by far""
measures a conceptual gap here.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious candidate for crypto version of ""Swiss account""

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious contender for crypto with cash equivalence for privacy.

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right again!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Devs focusing on foundations not bling.

&gt; What does this mean?

They focus on fundamental things rather than bling-bling that would
make the coin looks more shiny in the eyes of the masses on short-term. Sounds
pretty rational, but it's not what is done by altcoin devs 99% of
the time. 

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Major interest from BTC ""hero"" members and BTC whales.

&gt; Sure, because they are looking to diversify their holdings. Don't
put all your eggs in one basket.

Well yes, but you evade the point here. The point is this: why on
Monero and not another alt? For many of them this is the first alt in
which they invest with a long-term perspective, or even the first in
which they invest at all.  The volume on exchanges is consistantly
puzzling for such a completely new coin based on a little known tech.
For many btc early adopters, they say it publicly, there is only one precedent to
the potential of Monero: that of bitcoin itself.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Cpu/gpu friendly. / Robust asic resistance.

&gt; On supposed ""ASIC resistance"" as a feature: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf

Fair point.

&amp;nbsp;   


&gt;&gt; Current state inflationary but coin holds value.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising difficulty.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising hash rate.  
&gt;&gt; Relatively equitable distribution.  
&gt;&gt; Low hype.  
&gt;&gt; High signal to noise community here.  
&gt;&gt; No evidence of any pump/dump.  

&gt; Fluff, and subject to change due to any number of variables.

I disagree, this is not all fluff. Having a low-hype/smart/long-term
oriented community is *very* healthy. Of course it is subject to
change, nobody can talk for the future, but sooooo many new coins
already fail here.   
I really do mean ""healthy"". Consider that it boils down to
having people really trusting and betting on this on a long-term perspective. 
These people will actually *build* stuff, rather than just
trading the high and low before switching to another coin.   
Again, many see only one precedent to this: bitcoin.

&amp;nbsp;

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing. To make matters worse, we spent the first 6 months with completely mixed objectives, whilst still coming to grips with cryptography and a codebase we were unfamiliar with, whilst still patching a never-ending list of rapidly emerging issues, whilst getting to know *each other* as members of the core team, whilst still having to work to make a living.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets. So we start researching a bloom-filter style viewkey lookup, then we get hammered on ""breaking exploits"" from BCX. So we start figuring out what the exploit could-possibly-maybe-not-sure-who-knows-be, then we actually do get attacked. So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero  
https://github.com/tippero/tippero  
https://github.com/roosmaa/go-monero  
https://github.com/netmonk/moneronjs

https://github.com/openalias/openalias-api  
https://github.com/Jojatekok/MoneroGui.Net  
https://github.com/jwinterm/lightWallet

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

It might be better to use node.js or php for a very simple webpage app like this. I'm sure javascript and php are both capable of making the api call and parsing the json data (getStampTicker.py), and then multiplying last price by some amount and a constant (checkTicker method in btcTicker.py).

I do not believe that inference to be valid. Allowing the use of proper single-purpose addresses in no way forces all Monero transactions to be used for illicit purposes. Neither does the use of single-purpose addresses imply that something sinister is going on.

I am not advocating for Monero to be used for evil. I simply would prefer it to be a tool that can be used to gain as much privacy as reasonably possible.

In an ideal world, the payment ID addresses would be ""hardened"" somehow so they can't be picked apart.

The Red Cross can publish a regular Monero address. If single-purpose addresses happen to double as payment ID addresses, merchants will want to use those. People can hand out regular Monero addresses to relatives and acquaintances. The type of address shouldn't allow any kind of inference whether a transaction is evil or good.

In any case, let me give you one completely innocuous example for why I would like to be able to generate addresses more easily. I use different nicknames and email addresses for each website that requires me to register, such as various forums etc. Password managers allow this kind of thing to be done without becoming too painful. If I go and hand out the same address everywhere, my separated identities are suddenly tied together. Making a new wallet/account for each website is a lot more work than adding one more entry to a password manager.

Granted, I don't receive money in every place I visit, so I don't need quite as many wallets as I need nicknames and email addresses. :)",,1,,t1_cqniysn,t5_31hbr,,1429905293,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far you've mentioned ""people"" who were mining it ""for a long time"". Not a single person who is a known entity (with a credible WoT reputation and known publicly within the cryptography and/or cryptocurrency community) has stepped forward to validate this claim. Given the number of people involved in both cryptocurrency and Tor/I2P related projects, the lack of public, known figures stepping forward to validate this claim is indicative of the claim being baseless and untrue.

This claim about it ""being used on a few services on the deep web"" also lacks any basis. A screenshot of this Library Unicorn service with one mention on the entire page doth-not-a-claim-validate. Again - were this true, the many, many known deepweb operators (many of whom are in the Bitcoin WoT) would be rushing forward to confirm that they've been accepting Bytecoin for years.

In the absence of proof (an unobserved blockchain created in a closed-room environment is not proof) one simply cannot take Bytecoin's claims of ancient history as anything but a not-so-clever attempt to hide a premine.

* secondly, we wanted to refactor the blockchain class in the codebase to separate the storage logic from the validation/access logic.  This way we can more easily support many different ways of storing the blockchain (including putting it all back in RAM, if someone wants to).

It isn't about the blockchain - you can always simply work off the top block in Bitcoin, Monero or anything else. Rather, it's about the utxoset, i.e. the set of unspent outputs.

In Bitcoin (and Darkcoin and etc.) a spend is always obvious and uniquely identifiable because of the signature. In Monero, you can never know if an output has been spent *precisely because it has true anonymity*. Therefore the set of possibly unspent outputs grows in time. The way around this is to use another data structure, e.g. a hash tree of that set and of the set of unspent key images. This has been discussed in our dev channel, but obviously Monero has more primitive infrastructure needs to sort out at this moment.

I can't comment on Darkcoin's 'untraceability' when it still has no code open sourced. Regardless, the masternode method itself will always be vulnerable to malicious nodes. I find it a bit funny that anyone thinks that imposing a token cost to obtaining a node is a serious barrier for capable institutions.

At a more base level, it doesn't actually do anything you couldn't do yourself in Bitcoin by sending to multiple mixers and hoping at least one isn't corrupt. This makes the whole endeavor questionable considering any real user would want to stick to Bitcoin for obvious reasons.

Obviously we cannot speak for any other coins besides XMR, but your conclusions are provably false.

Regarding the worth of BCN, BCN is worth more than Monero. You can see this here: https://coinmarketcap.com/ (BCN is in 10th and Monero is in 18th). 

However, If you are wondering why 1 BCN is worth 0.00000009 BTC and 1 Monero is worth 0.03 BTC, well that's mainly because of the total amount of coins. Monero has a much smaller total amount of coins than Bytecoin. For this reason, 1 Monero is far rarer than 1 Bytecoin.

It's not that we're pretending that it *won't ever be a problem*, but we know that we can address it if it becomes a problem (and the rolling 6 month hard fork window speaks to that).

So let's assume that at some point Monero is so popular that the number of transactions starts outstripping what a home user can reasonably be expected to run. We can use the hard fork window to reduce the growth gap (the % block size above the median that is allowed) or raise fees or do whatever to keep Monero mainchain decentralised.

But over and above that we're working on enough daughter-chain stuff that mainchain won't need to bear the brunt of transactions / metadata. We won't need stuff like coloured coins, because that data can live in MoneroAssets chains. We won't need a bunch of microtransactions in mainchain, because that can use Tippero-style chains.

I have to say I really do think Bytecoin is a branding challenge due to inevitable mainstream confusion getting it muddled with Bitcoin. Darkcoin similarly will have an uphill struggle separating itself from the darkweb. Incidentally, the only way an anonymous coin is going to succeed in the mainstream is by proving it doesn't have nefarious intentions connected with tax evasion, money laundering, drugs, terrorism etc. Very difficult to play the libertarian argument when you're called Darkcoin.

He isn't talking about opsec, he's misunderstanding how Monero works (I suspect).

For OP's benefit: a Monero address is *completely* different to a Bitcoin style address, it has both view and spend public keys serialised and not hashed, so your public keys are completely visible by anyone who has your address. Since output ""destinations"" are computed from those keys, but the computation includes some random data, a ""destination"" has no visible link to an address, which means addresses can and should be reused.

&gt; On the off chance of a hit, the LEO's LEA subpoenas a bunch of exchanges for any business done with that address and receives enough identifying information to arrest the seller

I agree that this is a risk, but that's bad opsec on behalf of the person and good police work on behalf of the LEA. Monero isn't trying to encourage lawlessness, but it is trying to provide reasonable privacy by default whilst still provide opt-in transparency (public or private) via the viewkey.

This is also why simplewallet doesn't keep a record of the *addresses* you pay, since they're largely inconsequential except as a record-keeping tool. We may add this functionality as an option to be specified on account creation, but then, like many things, it's a convenience that sacrifices some privacy.

Exchanges, too, aren't obligated to keep the payout address as long as they keep a record of the actual transaction and which outputs were to the recipient (ie. which outputs weren't change outputs), although I doubt we'll ever convince exchanges to change.

The bottom line here is that being ""absolutely"" private with Monero does and should require very little effort, whereas with Bitcoin it requires a great deal of effort. Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked) or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction. Having a reusable address means that for each account you control you only backup once, only have one mnemonic to memorise, you can use OpenAlias to link to it, and you have one viewkey that you can give to the tax man or your accountant or whatever.

At some point we may create some guidelines for more ""absolute"" privacy opsec, but we DON'T want to encourage specific use-cases, especially of the illicit sort.",,3,xmr,t1_cqmybz1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

It isn't about the blockchain - you can always simply work off the top block in Bitcoin, Monero or anything else. Rather, it's about the utxoset, i.e. the set of unspent outputs.

In Bitcoin (and Darkcoin and etc.) a spend is always obvious and uniquely identifiable because of the signature. In Monero, you can never know if an output has been spent *precisely because it has true anonymity*. Therefore the set of possibly unspent outputs grows in time. The way around this is to use another data structure, e.g. a hash tree of that set and of the set of unspent key images. This has been discussed in our dev channel, but obviously Monero has more primitive infrastructure needs to sort out at this moment.

I can't comment on Darkcoin's 'untraceability' when it still has no code open sourced. Regardless, the masternode method itself will always be vulnerable to malicious nodes. I find it a bit funny that anyone thinks that imposing a token cost to obtaining a node is a serious barrier for capable institutions.

At a more base level, it doesn't actually do anything you couldn't do yourself in Bitcoin by sending to multiple mixers and hoping at least one isn't corrupt. This makes the whole endeavor questionable considering any real user would want to stick to Bitcoin for obvious reasons.

Like any new technology, I understand the first of any kind is likely an alpha test. A new concept will go through all of the rigorous tests that society can throw at it, from practicality, ease of use, exploitability, manipulation, spoofing/knock-off and general acceptance. Being that Bitcoin is a ‘currency’ and also acts as a ‘stock’, I figured that it was subject to the whims of the global market, making it even more susceptible to long-term failure or obsolescence. From early implementation, I was concerned that large investors or organizations with access to large computing infrastructure would corner the market or ramp up the difficulty. I watched small investors purchase GPU mining equipment, invest in ASICS and then cloud mining until the difficulty was hardly worth the effort. We then saw companies go bankrupt, investors lose their money and scammers cash out. When Litecoin and Altcoins in general started to appear, I believed the second phase of Bitcoin was starting and eventually markets would start shifting towards other coins that were still small-scale minable. I still didn’t see any noticeable traits that made Altcoins stand apart from Bitcoins, they were just clones with minor changes to the mining process, but overall they were all macro-minable. The same problem was still apparent; centralization was still possible. I have been waiting for a solid ASIC-hard coin, with privacy features and a non-Meme-Joke/immature image to invest in. I personally believe that decentralization, privacy, ease-of-use, professional brand and a dedicated DevTeam are the key features needed for a long-term successful coin. Most of the other coins with these traits were all deemed as scam-coins or were pre-mined. I have been waiting for a CPU coin that has all of the previously mentioned features without the flaws and that is actively working towards making it easier for the commoner to participate in the market. So far, Monero is number 1 on my list with all of these traits and current promises of continued development for the traits I believe that will make a coin successful in the long-term. While most Bitcoin investors believe that as difficulty becomes out of reach for most people, the price will go up; I personally believe that people will start pulling their money from Bitcoin and investing in something that continues to create currency over a long-term. Scarcity alone doesn’t create demand. Activity and perceived value creates demand. Scarcity is only valued when alternative options are not present. Cryptocurrency clearly will always have more options, therefore believing that scarcity will perpetually drive up demand is a joke. The only reason it’s still dominant is because of it’s level of acceptance. When another coin can achieve the same acceptance, Bitcoin will have nothing left working for it other than it’s PR tenure, which is also due to expire when a better solution arises. 

tl;dr Monero didn’t find me, I found Monero. True decentralization is the key to successful long-term open source currency.

I will try to use our time productively by sharing some educational information that could hopefully trump this boring elevator music:

Governments are printing paper money like confetti and in the process they are diluting our purchasing power of our savings with inflation.  In the process the bankers are getting richer and governments are misappropriating taxpayer money whilst the poor have to bear the financial tax burden of bailouts of the financial system for the horrible behaviour of the corruptible politicians.  Everyone can associate with the induced business cycles by the Federal Reserve System.  I am sure you are most familiar with what happened in 2008 during the world-wide recession, Cyprus bank bail ins and numerous other examples.

With the invention of Bitcoin the power of money creation is systematically eroded from governments.   The cryptographically protected decentralised ledger of Bitcoin is a revolutionary breakthrough because it converts money into an incorruptible protocol, the use of which is totally voluntary in contrast with the fiat money that is issued by governments that’s  use is violently being enforced via legal tender laws and gangs with guns i.e. police and military.

Bitcoin is undeniably a great achievement in generating a worldwide decentralised consensus ledger in a frictionless way, which forms a very sounds basis for a monetary platform.  However, the traceability of transactions through the Bitcoin ledger undermines financial privacy that in the current digital age of Orwellian government surveillance is undermining human liberty.  Financial privacy is as much a human right as any other and needs protection, hence the invention of Monero.

Monero’s cryptographic protocol achieves what Bitcoin was intended to but couldn’t because of fundamental cryptographic limitations.  In the long run the anonymous Monero protocol could mean more for financial freedom and liberty than Bitcoin.  Whilst Bitcoin could end the reliance on a parasitic Federal Reserve System, Monero could also end government and third party spying on your everyday financial transactions.

So, my hope is that you would feel intrigued and inquisitive in Googling the revolution that is Monero for yourself.  See you on the online forums.  Google will lead you there.

Have a great day and I hope this elevator trip will be most memorable.  
Adios!

That's incredible that they have that much money to spare for that project though crowdfunding. In hindsight, if Moolah was dragging its feet on the technical end then surely the same kind of majorly generous crowdfunding could have gone toward funding something that apparently the currency would die without? Also, I'm having trouble understanding this: The car fund was crowdfunded, but the ""buying (of) that NASCAR sponsorship wasn't really a team effort. Rather, it was disproportionately the work of one man"". I thought crowdfunds were big group efforts of people contributing money for a project they know the details of beforehand? Of course, it was only 10% of the investment money according to the article. Where did the other $450,000 go? Moreso, when people were giving money to this crowdfund, how was it presented? Do you have a link explaining that? Really I think people are just trying to pin a lack of significant core innovation on the most public voice, but I don't have a link for that. Just my opinion.

Also this: ""In March, Green filled out the paperwork to register Moolah as a proper U.K. company"" seems to mean very clearly that ATM's weren't around the corner. He was just beginning to fill out paperwork in March, so clearly any claims of having ATM's in March had to premature. For something like ATM's, you'd definitely need to be registered. Maybe he was just trying to match the energy and hype of the dogecoin community, and it was so overbearing that he felt pressured into saying everything will be done tomorrow. This is a typical response of pretty much anyone who is still fresh into engineering, and as he had only started his efforts three months before I would say he was still pretty fresh to engineering.

I do have to say that the fascination with the guy seems to be intense. Why is that, is he a core developer? He seems like just a third party that's just really excited about dogecoin, why's he getting so much attention?

Anyways, thanks for the article. The fundamental offerings of his services still stand as valid and extremely valuable additions though. Monero ATM's would be a significant innovation, as well as another exchange/wallet thing. One thing I would not let the guy have control over is a community's PR, he seems to be not a good fit for that based on just this article. If one were to get him on a team, rather than acting alone and so aggressively (getting them to discuss things more privately specifically), he might bring some seriously positive elements to the table. I'll do some more reading on him though.

I don't think this same hype is typical of the community supporting Monero, so I would have to think that his style wouldn't be overbearing as it clearly was with Doge. Clearly, the general atmosphere that he became a part of (and influenced) allowed things to get carried away very rapidly. Wasting money on non-core projects (or one's that aren't required for survival) is completely the opposite of what I'd expect here.

There's lines in that article that make me just wat though: ""Moolah's confused timeline extended to its registration with regulatory bodies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a U.S. government division devoted to tracking financial information like money laundering""
Clearly someone went out of their way to word this in a negative light here. Overall the article's pretty biased, and it seems motivated rather than taking a bipartisan stance.

Come on, how can I actually hope to see the full picture when there's lines like this: ""...repeatedly asking for more transparency from Moolah and Green, who vapes almost constantly, threatening to sue him for harassment."" Really? vaping? Better call the EPA! Someone better hide the children from this monster!

I dunno, it seems like the innovation he was trying to provide was crushed under the hype of the coin itself to me. He was both a victim and aggressor in that scenario. I mean if you're looking for a comparison, people were irrationally blaming Claymore for the price of Monero dropping even though he was taking in less than 3% of the daily volume on Poloniex.

Eventually, we will see another massive bitcoin bubble, and the powers that be will take note of and crack down on Darkcoin.

If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

As I mentioned in my reply to Hizonner just now, that's ONLY true if addresses are one-time or secret. Reusable addresses are actually a protection, because if Edward Snowden's address is public knowledge then your knowing it or having it on your phone cannot be an offence (not without LEA or whoever grossly overplaying their hand).

&gt; But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

It is just obfuscation, in a sense, but it's also not *that* weak, because an exchange (for instance) will then have a different ""address"" for each person, so it's very unlikely they'll ever publish their address without a payment ID.

To illustrate at a very basic, unstealthed level: let's say my address is ABC. Let's say Poloniex's address is DEF. Poloniex will no longer tell me to ""make a payment to DEF using payment ID 714"", they'll say ""make a payment to DEF714"". Your deposit address on Poloniex will be DEF837. Bob's address will be DEF419. Even if you are proficient and you can unpack the address to ""DEF"" searching for it won't reveal anything because Poloniex will never have publicly listed just that address for payment.

Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

&gt; At least in my case, I'm not asking to force everybody to use single-purpose addresses. I just would like an easier way of producing them that doesn't force me to incur extra fees or write my own wallet.

We don't really have the funding or manpower to build something like this out, so you'll either have to write it yourself or wait for some time in the far future when we are able to commit resources to it.",,0,xmr,t1_cqnfmzz,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

For each transaction, build an intersection of transactions from which the ring signature participants are sourced. Your ""2)"" should not make this more difficult. ""1)"" is only relevant when outputs are partially spent.

Example:  
I have outputs O^1, O^2, O^3, O^4, O^5, O^6, all generated in Transaction T^1 and want to use O^1, O^2, O^3.  
I randomly choose matching outputs for mixing: M^{1,1}, M^{1,2}, M^{2,1}, M^{2,2}, M^{3,1}, M^{3,2} from transactions T1{2..7}.  
I generate three ring signatures: RS^i = RS( O^i, M^{i,1}, M^{i,2} ), i in {1,2,3}  
I spend each output fully, without change.

The attacker takes RS^i and determines the sets of transactions: ST^1 = { T^1, T^2, T^3 }, ST^2 = { T^1, T^4, T^5 }, ST^3 = { T^1, T^6, T^7 }  
Candidates for the source transaction are then: Intersect( ST^1, ST^2, ST^3 ) = T^1  
The bigger the pool of outputs that mixing outputs are selected from, the lower the probability that the intersection will contain a transaction by chance, as long as there is more than one output in the transaction.

I also send a transaction using the other three outputs.  
Using the same approach, the attacker determines, that it also is linked to T^1 .  
The attacker now can link these two transactions back to T^1 , mark all outputs in T^1 as spent and eliminate them from analysis for future ring signatures.

This approach can possibly be generalized by building intersections over time slices or blocks instead of transactions, so splitting the transfer in two transactions is of limited usefulness.

If a sufficiently high number of outputs are used (let's say 8) and they stem from only few transactions (let's say 2), an attacker could also attempt to link these transactions, by swapping out Intersect for a less strict selection function (e.g. count which transactions occur more than #outputs/3 times).

If you receive few payments (let's say one, for argument's sake) before spending all XMR your wallet, this analysis will be enough to link all transactions you make back together. Change admittedly makes it harder, but if it is used in transactions to which this type of analysis also applies, it isn't a panacea.

I remain unconvinced that this isn't an issue.

FWIW, my ideas for mitigation would be:

1) If available, use outputs for transactions, which have not been generated with the same transaction or within a short time of each other.

2) If the wallet has to choose ""related"" outputs, also choose ""related"" outputs for mixing. This feels a bit iffy, but it shouldn't make matters worse than they are. Even if this is done rarely, it should be enough to make this kind of analysis unfeasible.

Edit: 2) May be even more effective if occassionally ""related"" outputs are chosen for mixing, even when no ""related"" outputs are used regularly.

As before, if this is all based on a misunderstanding, I would be most happy to be enlightened.

&gt; (By the way, Monero doesn't just always do 1.23 = 1 + 0.2 + 0.03, it also does other combinations like 0.6+0.4+0.2+0.002+0.001 etc.).

Nice. That's good to know.

&gt; With these two points, it's a pretty big stretch to try to connect any two transactions by appealing to human psychology.

Cryptonote and Zerocash are embedded in the protocol, making coins like Monero and future Zerocash, Fungible, and therefore true digital currencies.

In my honest view, the only reason left to develop/continue developing on Bitcoin is so that it gives leeway for other cryptocurrencies to rise to prominence, given that Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. All those things that you said Bitcoin provides, is provided by 3rd parties, and are centralized.

I'm sorry, but Satoshi said it himself about how Bitcoin's core features will never change. Therefore Bitcoin will eventually die out, it's simply too ""stone-age"", and it is in no way, shape, or form, a currency(It entirely lacks fungibility, something even Credit Cards have).

The reality: sidechain code will work in all existing altcoins and all altcoins into the future

Feel free to make a rebuttal to that, but the general supposition is wrong. Here is why: altcoins are open source code operating on the exact same codebase. People will just increase their respective currency's network effect by adding features. The only possibility is that it dilutes mining difficulty a little bit, temporarily.

For instance, there is no reason to add a dogecoin sidechain to bitcoin. Dogecoin has no features aside from a faster confirmation time LIKE EVERY OTHER ALTCOIN or new sidechaincoin that you can make out of thin air. Similarly, there is no reason to add a litecoin sidechain to bitcoin, it does not add features.

Dogecoin and Litecoin, for instance, would add a ring signature sidechain for people that want to pop in and out of anonymity.

Monero and cryptonote protocol would also be able to adopt the same technology. Monero could add a bitcoin-core based sidechain (with faster confirmation times and newer algorithm) so that people could list counterparty assets or use colored coins. Something that cryptonote would have to otherwise develop from scratch.

So Blockstream and whoever else is promoting sidechains is not telling the full story, but it isn't a conspiracy or anything, you just have to understand how open source code works and use your own cognition to synthesize details.

Also I can see a future where monero, bitcoin, etherium can live side by side each one used where it's best:
-bitcoin as a sort of gold, storage of value.
-monero for everyday payment.
-etherium for specific smart contract.

And this will help the scalability problem as each of them keep specific role and are not used for/by 100% of the populations which might be impossible to do.

Monero has a long way to go before it even begins to mature and it does have some thorny issues that are yet to be worked out (especially if it becomes fairly popular).

He isn't talking about opsec, he's misunderstanding how Monero works (I suspect).

For OP's benefit: a Monero address is *completely* different to a Bitcoin style address, it has both view and spend public keys serialised and not hashed, so your public keys are completely visible by anyone who has your address. Since output ""destinations"" are computed from those keys, but the computation includes some random data, a ""destination"" has no visible link to an address, which means addresses can and should be reused.

&gt; On the off chance of a hit, the LEO's LEA subpoenas a bunch of exchanges for any business done with that address and receives enough identifying information to arrest the seller

I agree that this is a risk, but that's bad opsec on behalf of the person and good police work on behalf of the LEA. Monero isn't trying to encourage lawlessness, but it is trying to provide reasonable privacy by default whilst still provide opt-in transparency (public or private) via the viewkey.

This is also why simplewallet doesn't keep a record of the *addresses* you pay, since they're largely inconsequential except as a record-keeping tool. We may add this functionality as an option to be specified on account creation, but then, like many things, it's a convenience that sacrifices some privacy.

Exchanges, too, aren't obligated to keep the payout address as long as they keep a record of the actual transaction and which outputs were to the recipient (ie. which outputs weren't change outputs), although I doubt we'll ever convince exchanges to change.

The bottom line here is that being ""absolutely"" private with Monero does and should require very little effort, whereas with Bitcoin it requires a great deal of effort. Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked) or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction. Having a reusable address means that for each account you control you only backup once, only have one mnemonic to memorise, you can use OpenAlias to link to it, and you have one viewkey that you can give to the tax man or your accountant or whatever.

At some point we may create some guidelines for more ""absolute"" privacy opsec, but we DON'T want to encourage specific use-cases, especially of the illicit sort.",,3,xmr,t1_cqmybz1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't get this. It's not knowing the list of addresses; it's knowing the association between those addresses and the people behind them.

You've posted your address in this thread. If I find out that Alice has made a payment to that address, doesn't that tell me that Alice has made a payment to you?

Suppose Bob posts his address on his online store, because he's been told that ""Unlike bitcoin where a new address is recommended for each transaction, a Monero address may be safely re-used without compromising anonymity."". If I find out that Alice has sent a payment using Bob's address, don't I then know that she's paid Bob?

In both of those cases, can't I find the true name of the recipient just by pasting the address into Google?

There may be one-time addresses under the covers, but if Alice sees only persistent addresses, those are the ones she can leak.

The robo-signer you have in mind is a bit different than the one I have in mind, and guards against a bit different threat. But as you say, that's hypothetical at this point.

&gt; There is literally nothing we can do to prevent statistics from being gathered. What we CAN do, though, is provide end-to-end strict TLS from users to our servers, and do so in a way that protects and shields our infrastructure (thus reducing that risk profile down to very sophisticated and highly motivated attackers only).

What do you say about this https://blog.paymium.com/2014/02/19/the-cloudflare-mitm/ ?

TLS doesn't protect you against CloudFlare, and by extension, it doesn't protect you against anyone who hacks CloudFlare, including eventual employees of that company.

In addition, the simple fact that CloudFlare (and you can definitely put Google Analytics in that too) is used by so many sites nowadays make it worse than a typical VPS. Their database, being so much larger and having so much data about so many people, becomes much more interesting to hackers.

&gt; Compiling it yourself is always the better option.

Wow. Such practical. Much user friendly!

I'm honestly struggling to use Monero. There's no PPA, no deb package, nothing. The binaries on the site don't work as is. I had to run a script that a helpful guy linked me to in a forum. The script itself didn't work, but at least it seems to have installed all libraries necessary for the binaries downloaded previously to work.

Now all I have are two command line applications. The GUI wallet doesn't work.

In my honest view, the only reason left to develop/continue developing on Bitcoin is so that it gives leeway for other cryptocurrencies to rise to prominence, given that Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. All those things that you said Bitcoin provides, is provided by 3rd parties, and are centralized.

I'm sorry, but Satoshi said it himself about how Bitcoin's core features will never change. Therefore Bitcoin will eventually die out, it's simply too ""stone-age"", and it is in no way, shape, or form, a currency(It entirely lacks fungibility, something even Credit Cards have).

I have stopped using Bitcoin entirely except for ""HODLING"", because it makes no sense to use it. With Bitcoin, I have to go through a shit-ton of work and risk(3rd partys' exit scamming) just to remain somewhat private, and even then I can never be private because Bitcoin doesn't/won't have I2P to block IP address of nodes, while with Monero I can do absolutely nothing and remain anonymous and I2P is coming on the way... and that's how it should be.

&gt;__Monero__ (XMR, [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)-like [ticker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_symbol)), literally *coin* in [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), is a [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) focusing on [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy), [decentralisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralisation) and [scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability). It was created in April 2014 as a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development\)) of [Bytecoin (BCN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoNote#Bytecoin_.28BCN.29) and became the second [CryptoNote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoNote)-based cryptocurrency.

Now that disclaimer aside, lets tear the rest of your post apart. You have confused what zerocoin, and zerocash are and do. They have been vaporware since 2013. There are actual challenges in creating zksnarks in a trustless way and it ultimately means a separate coin on an existing blockchain network (ie. one could transact with bitcoin, or they could transact with zerocoin IOUs on the bitcoin network). These are not upgrades to the cryptonote protocol, they are completely different and vaporware. Cryptonote's use of time tested ring signatures is way better than zerocoin and the related/conceptually worse zerocash.

Sidechains are also vaporware, it is an interesting idea but you have to understand that every blockchain network will also be able to redundantly create sidechains too. These networks will continue to compete for security and investment. Bitcoin will remain be transparent with convoluted opt-in privacy, Monero will remain private with opt-in transparency. But it is just Blockstream's sidechain koolaid that neglects the obvious redundancy that will occur.

-bitcoin as a sort of gold, storage of value.

-etherium for specific smart contract.

Having some facility to generate additional addresses within a single wallet/account would make it a lot easier and more convenient to preserve unlinkability outside the blockchain.

There is another issue with using separate wallets/accounts. Unless you take care to forward any funds received in your single-use wallet/account to a global collection wallet/account, you end in a situation where all possible outputs you can use in future transactions come from a single or low number of transactions (this is bad, see MRL-004, section 3.2).

Cryptonote is the tech behind transactions, blockchain's and basically the coin itself. You can read up about the cryptonote features here: https://cryptonote.org/inside.php

Regarding the worth of BCN, BCN is worth more than Monero. You can see this here: https://coinmarketcap.com/ (BCN is in 10th and Monero is in 18th). 

However, If you are wondering why 1 BCN is worth 0.00000009 BTC and 1 Monero is worth 0.03 BTC, well that's mainly because of the total amount of coins. Monero has a much smaller total amount of coins than Bytecoin. For this reason, 1 Monero is far rarer than 1 Bytecoin. For the same reason 1 Doge is worth so little (around 0.00000030 BTC) even though it has quite a high market cap.

Truth is we are not trying to merely create a GUI, as in a GUI wrapper. Fact is these simple wrappers already exist (Neozaru, Jojatekok and jwinterm's and we could probably use Bitcoin wallet, like Pebblecoin does).

What we are trying to build is **scalable** GUI software. And *scalable* is the hard part, not *GUI*.

## What is scalable?

* Mnemonic seed for increased security ([why](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/isnt-mnemonic-seed-and-inability-change-words-security-holes)).
* Low RAM footprint (""the DB"", presently [Symas Lightning MDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) but later a lot others, since we built a database API).
* e-commerce prerequisites, notably for payment processors.
* Low bandwith footprint (a framework for SPV, like Electrum). The [remote node](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/how-use-remote-node) provides a similar experience in that one doesn't have to download the whole blockchain, but this is where the similarities end and SPV would be lighter than a remote node.
- Much better understood (thus secure) and refactored code. This is behind-the-scene stuff and not sexy, but when it comes to securing your money, this matters. The Monero Protocol is sound, but we are not that comfortable with the source code we inherited in April (and improved since then). Note: we are pretty demanding on security, so when I say that ""we are not that comfortable"", this means the security is already high, just not high enough :)
- Gitian binaries
- Various mainstream users niceties, such as an address book, an easy way to do bookeeping (including easily report to tax offices, because Monero is not meant just for l33t haX0r, but for everyone, including legal persons like corporations, NGO, political parties...)
- Viewkey for optional transparency (see fluffy quote on Three Pilllars)
- Have a solid foundation for easy improvements later on (like third-parties improvements). Because once the (scalable) GUI wallet will be there, we expect things to accelerate - and we rather be ready for the acceleration. Fasten your seatbelt, Dorothy. 

## Why is scalable important?

Because it is one of the three pillars :)

More seriously, because once the official GUI wallet will be there, visibility will increase a lot. Which means more users who know nothing about Monero and later not even about cryptocurrencies. These people won't give a second thought. One does only one first impression. It *must* be the right one. Hence the necessity for a wallet than can handle the load. Be scalable, not that much on a technical standpoint than on a, say, ""political"" standpoint.

Having some facility to generate additional addresses within a single wallet/account would make it a lot easier and more convenient to preserve unlinkability outside the blockchain.

There is another issue with using separate wallets/accounts. Unless you take care to forward any funds received in your single-use wallet/account to a global collection wallet/account, you end in a situation where all possible outputs you can use in future transactions come from a single or low number of transactions (this is bad, see MRL-004, section 3.2). This means that, if you wish to use Monero without reusing addresses, you have to spend additional transaction fees and have the hassle of resending funds to yourself.

No actually its not. Bytecoin is more profitable according to the [Minergate](https://minergate.com/calc) calculator. 

1000h/s gets you 77760 BCN or 1.563 XMR

So XMR profitability is 1.563 * 0.0031 (current XMR exchange rate - low) = 0.0048453 BTC

and BCN profitability is 77760 BCN * 0.00000007 (current BCN exchange rate - also low) = 0.0054432

I pointed out that this is a non-issue because the outputs are all denominated by decimal value (e.g. 12.34 = 10 + 2 + 0.3 + 0.04) so there are always a huge number of matching outputs.

Anonymint correctly pointed that this increases the blockchain size (more outputs in a tx). A technically illiterate forum member by the name of AlexGR used this to FUD Monero because he's a big investor in Darkcoin (DRK). It didn't occur to this guy that DRK also uses a denomination scheme and bloats the blockchain relative to Bitcoin. :)

At this point in time, DRK had a bit of a problem because it still had nothing to show and it's simple CoinJoin would be on obsolete on arrival anyway. The developer Evan Duffield declared that he would implement ring signatures in ""version 2"".

A few days later he realized he's out of his depth and has no chance (he's a coder, not a cryptographer). But he had to save face so he announced he's going to stick with CoinJoin because the new cryptography is unsafe and it bloats the chain. So begins the misguided FUD.

A literate user of course realizes that it doesn't actually matter that XMR, DRK, Zerocoin or anything else has a larger chain (unless it was bigger by a factor of several hundred or more, far outpacing memory growth).

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.
4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.
9. Write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed.
10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.
11. Switch off the computer, remove the battery if there is one, and leave it physically off for a few hours.

There you go - the wallet you've created was created in RAM, and the digital files are now lost forever.

I will try to use our time productively by sharing some educational information that could hopefully trump this boring elevator music:

Governments are printing paper money like confetti and in the process they are diluting our purchasing power of our savings with inflation.  In the process the bankers are getting richer and governments are misappropriating taxpayer money whilst the poor have to bear the financial tax burden of bailouts of the financial system for the horrible behaviour of the corruptible politicians.  Everyone can associate with the induced business cycles by the Federal Reserve System.  I am sure you are most familiar with what happened in 2008 during the world-wide recession, Cyprus bank bail ins and numerous other examples.

With the invention of Bitcoin the power of money creation is systematically eroded from governments.   The cryptographically protected decentralised ledger of Bitcoin is a revolutionary breakthrough because it converts money into an incorruptible protocol, the use of which is totally voluntary in contrast with the fiat money that is issued by governments that’s  use is violently being enforced via legal tender laws and gangs with guns i.e. police and military.

Bitcoin is undeniably a great achievement in generating a worldwide decentralised consensus ledger in a frictionless way, which forms a very sounds basis for a monetary platform.  However, the traceability of transactions through the Bitcoin ledger undermines financial privacy that in the current digital age of Orwellian government surveillance is undermining human liberty.  Financial privacy is as much a human right as any other and needs protection, hence the invention of Monero.

Monero’s cryptographic protocol achieves what Bitcoin was intended to but couldn’t because of fundamental cryptographic limitations.  In the long run the anonymous Monero protocol could mean more for financial freedom and liberty than Bitcoin.  Whilst Bitcoin could end the reliance on a parasitic Federal Reserve System, Monero could also end government and third party spying on your everyday financial transactions.

So, my hope is that you would feel intrigued and inquisitive in Googling the revolution that is Monero for yourself.  See you on the online forums.  Google will lead you there.

Have a great day and I hope this elevator trip will be most memorable.

&gt; The solution to this special case is a transaction split for the denominated values so that Intersect(ST^i, ...) is empty. In the bigger picture, O^1 ... O^7 then look just as if they were mixins used by someone else but end up in separate transactions. Spreading over blocks reduces circumstantial association.

After mulling over this for a bit, I'm not sure it is enough. Using a probabilistic model, an attacker could still infer that transactions within a relatively short time interval, which include inputs from the same transaction, are related with a high probability. That is, the chance of having n inputs from the same transaction within m blocks of each other would have a probability of roughly around:

(m * (average mixin factor) * (average transactions per block) / (transactions in blockchain))^n

Now, I don't have the numbers to run that calculation handy, but I believe that an attacker could quickly reach a high confidence, especially if the transactions are not only in nearby blocks, but also have identical mixin and similar denominations.

Edit: I think there may be something wrong with my reasoning above, but I'm too tired to take care of it right now.

Adding  
a) multiple inputs from the same random transactions as mixins  
b) with a random chance (1%-10%?)  
c) once above a certain mixin factor, to avoid some active attacks  
would, in my opinion, provide a stronger defense while also preventing attackers from eliminating ""identified"" outputs from future ring signatures. Finding transactions that fit may be difficult though.

Alternatively, it should be possible to automatically slowly spread out outputs in a wallet over a sufficiently big time interval that the probability given above is high enough not to allow an attacker to infer anything about the transactions.

&gt; I would guess you need ~5-10 or so in practice

That sounds about right to me.

&gt; Over time a wallet builds up a set of input transactions to work from so this isn't needed.

I see some use cases, which seem somewhat common, were this is unlikely to happen though. For example, somebody who buys a big amount of Monero once, while it is cheap (e.g. now) and then holds, with occasional spends, wouldn't accumulate enough input transactions.",,1,,t1_ck5dymp,t5_31hbr,,1409522744,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; In order to know that Alice has been paying Bob they'd have to ask Alice, not Bob.

No, they have to get the information from Alice. They don't have to *ask* her. They just have to get it somehow. And once they get it, they immediately know it's Bob she's been paying, because Bob has followed the path of least resistance and made a particular address synonymous with his name.

My point is that there are just too many ways for Alice to accidentally leak that address. Addresses aren't going to leak all the time, but they *will* leak. And when they do, your approach increases the impact.

You wanted scenarios. I'll give you a handful of related groups. Yes, they mostly involve somebody's poor opsec, or even bad faith. My point is that poor opsec and bad faith happen all the time and should be compensated for.

And, yes, there are tons of ways for Alice to blow it that don't involve Monero. It's just that there's no reason to add *more*.

Anti-security
-------------
Alice is concerned about somebody stealing her private keys, so she uses a multisig wallet (I assume you want to support those sometime), with one of the hot keys held by a service provider. Every time she makes a payment, she has to tell that service provider who she's paying. The service provider effectively knows everybody she's paying.

1. The service provider profiles Alice's transactions, puts her on a list of ""likely"" pregnant women, and sells that list to a drugstore. Alice starts getting pregnancy-related ads in the mail. Unfortunately Alice, who really is pregnant, is also 17 and lives with rather unenlightened parents, who interrogate her, get a confession out of her, and throw her out. Loosely based on [a true story](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/).
2. Alice buys a used TV from Bob on eBay. Unknown to Alice, Bob normally uses his Monero address to sell crack. Bob even has a nice little Monero FAQ advising his customers to use that same multisig service. Bob is just cheating a little on his opsec, just this once. LEAs catch Bob for other reasons, and demand a list of his customers from the multisig service. Alice gets raided. They shoot her dog.
3. The service provider gets hacked, and the transaction history hits the Net. I'll let you come up with your own consequence here.

Unfortunate omission
--------------------
Alice is getting ready to leave her abusive, controlling boyfriend. She buys a ticket to another town using Monero. She cuts and pastes the address. She uses the browser private mode. But she doesn't remember to clear the paste buffer. Her boyfriend gets on that same computer later on, and happens to hit control-V. He's no computer expert, but Monero is popular; he knows a Monero address when he sees one. The next time he hits control-V, it's into Google search.

Alice gets a beatdown.

The contact
-----------
Alice buys ""private"" things from Bob regularly. She has a contact entry for Bob, with his address in it. Not being crazy, she puts it under a pseudonym, but not being a crypto geek, she doesn't realize that it's still effectively Bob's name.

1. Bob sells specialized porn, which Alice consumes but has issues about. She uploads her contact to Google.  Alice is embarrassed and creeped out by getting ads targeted to her fetishes, and has no idea why.
2. Bob sells generic porn. Alice works for Focus on the Family. One day Alice accidentally puts her contact in the work database. Alice gets fired.
3. Bob raises money for Falun Gong. He's even a good boy and has a separate address for that purpose. Alice uploads the contact to her Baidu account. Alice gets arrested.

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.

Faking the blockchain is trivial, and releasing a purposely crippled miner only lends credence to this theory. In a matter of weeks the Monero team has unravelled and undone the crippled code, and improved the RPC API by adding critical functionality that merchants and exchanges could simply not have operated without.

Even if you take the fact that Monero is clearly leading the innovation race, I would think it dangerous to touch a coin where 82% of it is held by unknown actors who were not publicly observed during the period where they supposedly mined the coin.

In other words: even if you ignore the features/aspects of Monero that give it real fungibility, several of these other features are things that Bitcoin almost certainly won't ever add. I mention them in the talk I've been giving at the meetups in Europe, so I'll cut-and-paste from those slides:

- *Slightly Inflationary:* To retain mining incentive there is a minimum block reward of 0.3 XMR kicks in around May, 2022, and will stay at that amount indefinitely.

- *No Block Limits:* Block size is dynamically limited based on a look-back window. As Monero’s usage increases, block size will naturally increase.

- *Disconnected Architecture:* The daemon keeps your connection to the network. Account/wallet implementations, including CLI and RPC apps, talk to the daemon.

- *Different Crypto:* Uses Ed25519 / Curve25519 / EdDSA, whereas Bitcoin uses secp256k1 / ECDSA. Neither is inherently superior, really.

- *Accessible PoW:* Lowers the performance gap between CPU, GPU, FPGA, &amp; ASIC mining. Should allow even CPU mining for the foreseeable future.

All of this doesn't mean that Monero will be successful. But we're also not trying to ""compete"" with Bitcoin. I believe that we each serve different purposes, and that's ok.

I always glossed over the concept that cryptocurrencies are a ""ledger"" - being that I have never used a ledger. As such, the key for me to understand how the blockchain actually works is that ledgers are always ""written to""... a concept that was apparently odd for me, I assume due to generational effects of never balancing a checkbook (computers have always done it for me) and always working with digital file storage, in which, for the most part, you can rewrite anything or delete anything etc. 

So there is no ""debit"" that occurs.... you just own a particular bunch of lines on the ledger. Furthermore, there are no ""tokens"" as I originally imagined them.

Lets assume you just joined Monero, and your name is Bob, - you made a new address, and someone sent you 12 monero, and you've been lucky mining, so you've got 5 monero from mining. On the ledger, there's a line that says ""Bob owns 12 monero!"" on block 500. And some other lines associated with your mining rewards, which probably came in tiny bits, so there are 5 lines of ""Bob owns 1 monero!"" in blocks 501 - 506

So when the wallet software scans the blockchain, it sees all these lines and adds them up to tell you ""You have 17 monero""

Now, if you want to go and send Alice 5 monero, this is NOT what happens, and is what I thought happened until I finally had it explained enough to get it - 

The protocol/wallet/blackbox/whatever subtracts 5 monero from your total account, and adds 5 monero to Alice's account. 

Instead, what actually happens is the protocol/wallet/blackbox scans the blockchain, looking for your lines. It finds the line ""bob has 12 monero"" and the 5 lines of ""bob owns 1 monero"". Based on a variety of factors (especially for monero with mixins etc), the wallet software will go ""I'm going to use these lines for this transaction"". For the sake of simplicity, lets just say it uses the ""Bob has 12 monero"" line.

So in a new line in the ledger, a new line is written that essentially means ""We're going to use that line up there that says 'Bob has 12 Monero'. We're then going to make a new line that says ""Bob has 7 monero"" and also make a new line that says ""Alice has 5 monero"". 

So now when the wallet software scans the blockchain (after this transaction has been accepted by the network), it will still see the original ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line, but then it will see the new transaction that occured that used that line, so it no longer counts it in the total. That line has been ""used up"", or in blockchain talk, turned into an input. 

But its important to realize that the ""Bob has 12 monero!"" line gets turned into an input by the new transaction. In reality (in the database, the blockchain), the line in block 500 still exists that says ""bob has 12 monero!"". But the new line in block 510 essentially says ""That line in block 500 should be ignored, and these new lines should be used instead - the ones that say Bob has 7 Monero and Alice has 5 Monero"".

Well, thats my attempt at explaining outputs and inputs. How'd I do?",,3,,t1_crmqp82,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not so sure about that. The information on Wikileaks is public, but I remember some sort of commotion about US government workers being warned about looking at it for legal reasons.

When he started ignoring the community's overwhelming desire not to make Monero a merge-mined coin we (the Core Team, current stewards of the project) forked it and sort of came together. The core team did not know each other really, and the takeover wasn't planned. Some of us peripherally knew other members of the core team, so our binding factor was ""right place, right time"" plus each of us not being completely, utterly retarded. Of the 7 core team members 2 are not anonymous (myself and David) and the other 5 use pseudonyms (and practice their own opsec to a greater or lesser degree of their choosing).

2. I think the viewkey functionality solves that problem entirely. Oppressive governments can demand their citizens hand over their viewkeys, more permissive governments can ask that they volunteer them for tax / regulation purposes. Neither of those governments can know if you have a private account or accounts (the privacy-leaking edge cases is what we're tightening up right now through things like i2p integration) so it really is ""private by default, optionally transparent"".
3. We have infinite supply (the block reward reduces to a minimum of 0.3 XMR in ~8 years and then stays at that value indefinitely) so late comers won't feel left out - it's a slightly inflationary cryptocurrency, not deflationary.
4. I think for something like Monero technical excellence will outstrip the competition. Anyone who knows about decentralised security software design and cryptography, and wants to get involved and contribute, would gravitate towards contributing to Monero rather than launch a competitor. Additionally, we're already diverging away from CryptoNote and will continue to do so quite dramatically (to fix their shortcomings and introduce new functionality), so a competitor would have to be forked from us.
5. Darknote is an outlier, I can't tell if they're part of the Bytecoin / CryptoNote scam, but they're certainly an interesting proposition if you want a currency that implements the CN protocol and won't veer away.
6. Lack of funding coupled with impatience from a userbase whose only reference points are the (relatively) mature Bitcoin and a bunch of premined / ICO-funded ~~scams~~ altcoins; heretofore unknown issues in the Ed25519 curve or some core cryptography that we can't replace fast enough; general and overwhelming apathy towards privacy, where people are content with sacrificing all privacy as long as they get ""free"" stuff.",,13,xmr,t1_cr6jmel,t5_31hbr,moderator,1431467431,,,,,,,,,,,

You can adjust N by varying the 'mixin' value. Higher mixin = higher N. I'm not sure what the exact correlation is but as someone else said you can always try it yourself and follow the transactions on the blockchain explorer (monerochain.info).

In terms of performance impact, higher mixin gives larger transaction sizes (I think) and also requires higher fees. Will also result in larger blockchain size the more mixin is used, unless the devs do something smart to address this (probably requiring a hard fork).

For your second question - the whole idea is that the transaction is 'fragmented' in such a way that it's (in theory) impossible to tell what is the actual output and what is obfuscation/change returning. 

But yeah try some small transactions and then have a look on monerochain.info to see how they look.

You can adjust N by varying the 'mixin' value. Higher mixin = higher N. I'm not sure what the exact correlation is but as someone else said you can always try it yourself and follow the transactions on the blockchain explorer (monerochain.info).

In terms of performance impact, higher mixin gives larger transaction sizes (I think) and also requires higher fees. Will also result in larger blockchain size the more mixin is used, unless the devs do something smart to address this (probably requiring a hard fork).

For your second question - the whole idea is that the transaction is 'fragmented' in such a way that it's (in theory) impossible to tell what is the actual output and what is obfuscation/change returning.

Alice leaks an entire transaction? Including cryptographic proof thereof? Or does Alice accidentally Tweet ""paid 100 XMR for cocaine to 4ABCDEFG""? If she's that dumb Monero isn't going to protect her, definitely not by inconveniencing the crap out of everyone.

&gt; This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have.

So this is how Monero works: we provide the best privacy we can whilst not making Monero a complete pain to use, and still making things like optional and voluntary transparency available.

There's a level of corner cases we simply *can't* prevent, including things like Ed25519 being compromised by the NSA, or the FBI buying up 83% of the output set, or Alice putting her transaction history online.

Of course, if any of these become an actual / recurrent problem we'll see if we can mitigate them, and if not we'll raise the red flag. But our main aim with Monero is, first and foremost, to provide something that is *useful and usable* whilst still retaining as much privacy as is reasonably possible.

Monero is not trying to compete with Zerocash. In 20 or 30 years when Zerocash's cryptography has been more thoroughly vetted then I fully expect it make Monero redundant. Between now and then, though, our aim is not to deal in absolutes and not to preemptively cover every edge case at the cost of usability.

I remain unconvinced that effectively breaking the viewkey functionality and overcomplicating the wallet system provides anything more than absolutely peripheral benefits whilst preventing very few privacy-breaking edge cases.

I have never doubted that and never said I doubted it. Seriously, whatever's on the block chain, and whatever's sent in the protocol, has nothing to with my issue. Nor do I doubt your assertion that the wallet software doesn't keep a history of addresses it's sent money to.

All of my concerns are about leakage *outside of and around* the actual Monero software.

What I'm saying is that Alice is going to be leaky. She is going to make mistakes, and those mistakes are sometimes going to disclose the addresses she's paying to. Sometimes she'll make technical mistakes, and sometimes she'll just trust the wrong people or software. Alice will leak recipient addresses through pathways that are *not part of the wallet, not part of the block chain, and in no way under your control*. Sometimes Alice will even leak for actually rational reasons.

If you encourage Bob to make his address a unique identifier for him, or even for one of his lines of business, that makes Alice's leakiness a bigger risk for her (and probably for him, too).

You seem to be taking the position that Alice just shouldn't leak. But that's not how real users work in the real world. You have to do everything possible to *help* Alice not to leak... and then assume she will anyway, and try to minimize the impact of that.

&gt; Also let's be clear: *there is no practical way to enforce one-time address use on a protocol level*

Obviously not. But that doesn't mean that the way the wallet software works doesn't have an enormous impact on when and whether one-time addresses *actually get used*. Not only does it affect the relative convenience, but it affects the expectations that get built up, and sometimes locked in, in surrounding systems.

It also affects the profitability for attackers of developing tools and capabilities to exploit the address reuse case, and that matters in practice.

&gt; Having a third-party robosigning for you means that you trust that third-party implicitly with your data.

Um, that really depends on what you mean by ""my data"".

It's one thing to trust a third party with a unique ephemeral recipient address that will only ever be used in one transaction, knowing that it's relatively likely that the address really is ephemeral, because the whole surrounding system is built to make that the path of least resistance.

It's a different thing to trust a third party with what amounts to the True Name of the recipient.

There are gradations and variations, of course. For example, for this particular case, you could do something like a Bitcoin stealth address, and have Alice generate an address she *knew* was unique to hand to the third party. In that case, she could still leak the underlying stealth address, but she at least wouldn't be forced to give full information to the third party.

&gt;&gt; She uploads her contact to Google

&gt; If she's paying Bob privately and he's not using stealth payment IDs (see above) then it's the same as Alice having his email address (which, let's say, is totally_not_weird_bob@gmail.com). All of those connections to Bob can be made by her accidentally uploading the contact with his email.

Yes, it's true that any other publicly known identifier for Bob is equally dangerous.

But this is a good example of how reality intrudes, and how little details can make people change people's behavior to make them leak. Bob's email address isn't 96 characters of base64. Alice can memorize Bob's email address easily enough. Or she can obfuscate it in a way that she can reverse mentally. She can't do either with a Monero address, so she has more incentive to store it in a database somewhere (contacts or otherwise).

Furthermore, if she's not like you or me, Alice is less likely to subjectively *realize* that she needs to protect that address. She's got a very good chance of seeing Bob's email address as a name for Bob, and a significantly smaller chance of recognizing his Monero address as one.

Incidentally, the only way an anonymous coin is going to succeed in the mainstream is by proving it doesn't have nefarious intentions connected with tax evasion, money laundering, drugs, terrorism etc. Very difficult to play the libertarian argument when you're called Darkcoin.

Of course, I'm only mentioning the aesthetics here. I'll leave it to others to describe the various technical flaws of Bytecoin and Darkcoin of which has been demonstrated pretty extensively.",,2,,t1_chvmixd,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

You can adjust N by varying the 'mixin' value. Higher mixin = higher N. I'm not sure what the exact correlation is but as someone else said you can always try it yourself and follow the transactions on the blockchain explorer (monerochain.info).

In terms of performance impact, higher mixin gives larger transaction sizes (I think) and also requires higher fees. Will also result in larger blockchain size the more mixin is used, unless the devs do something smart to address this (probably requiring a hard fork).

For your second question - the whole idea is that the transaction is 'fragmented' in such a way that it's (in theory) impossible to tell what is the actual output and what is obfuscation/change returning.

Darkcoin definitely has the momentum advantage.  Since I got in shortly after they both came on the scene, XMR is down 75% and DRK is up 500%.

Personally, I think Darkcoin will take over the illicit elements of Bitcoin in the near term as Bitcoin becomes more ""legitimate"".  Eventually, we will see another massive bitcoin bubble, and the powers that be will take note of and crack down on Darkcoin.  People running Masternodes in the US and extraditable countries will be fucked and the price of Darkcoin will tank.  This may or may not kill it... depends on how decentralized it has become by that point.

As for Monero (and Darkcoin), the biggest threat I see is a Bitcoin 2-way pegged CryptoNote sidechain; Essentially Monero backed by Bitcoin.  I think such is the fate of all altcoins eventually.

As a first stop, I'll reiterate [my post from Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.msg8246348#msg8246348) on creating a secure offline wallet:

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.
4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.
9. Write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed.
10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.
11. Switch off the computer, remove the battery if there is one, and leave it physically off for a few hours.

There you go - the wallet you've created was created in RAM, and the digital files are now lost forever. If some magical hacker manages to somehow get the data, they will lack the long password to open it. If you need to receive payments, you have the address, and you have the view key if needed. If you need access to it, you have your 24 word seed, and you can now write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever. Then write a bunch of extra love letters. That way, if your deposit box is ever discovered, it'll be disregarded as unimportant love letters.

**Creating a secure, online wallet**

Create a new wallet on your computer, using a reasonably secure password or passphrase, and write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed. You can transact using your wallet, knowing that if the wallet files are stolen it is extremely unlikely that an attacker will be able to brute-force your password (wallet files are quite heavily encrypted).

The same process of securing your 24 word seed as with the offline wallet applies: write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever.

Single POW means all the miners mine one algorithm that feeds the blockchain.

Multi POW means every miner can choose between one of several algorithms he wants to mine on. For example Asic owners can mine SHA, GPU miners can mine Scrypt or Skein, people with high electricity costs can mine an algorithm like Groestl or Qubit which effectively uses up to 50% less power.

It also increases the security of the network. Where single POW coins are vulnerable to 51% takeovers, an attacker on the Myriad chain would need 81% of any single algorithm, or 20% or at least 3 algorithms combined.

I'm a Monero supporter and I don't want to annoy anyone by posting what seems like a shameless promotion of another coin.

No actually its not. Bytecoin is more profitable according to the [Minergate](https://minergate.com/calc) calculator.

So XMR profitability is 1.563 * 0.0031 (current XMR exchange rate - low) = 0.0048453 BTC

and BCN profitability is 77760 BCN * 0.00000007 (current BCN exchange rate - also low) = 0.0054432

Of course, not everything has worked out for either coin. LTC has trouble justifying its existence and use while PPC has to deal with centralized checkpointing and hoarding. There are no direct parallels, but this can help non-technical people get a sense of the difference.

&gt; Since the beginning of time man has lived two lives: the public, and the private. What happened in his cave, his hut, his castle, his house, his apartment, was his and his alone. Revealing or sharing that was at his discretion, and this is the very nature of the gift of the free will that man possesses. At the dawn of this 21st century, however, man is fighting a losing battle to retain his privacy. The very powers elected by him and meant to protect and defend him are invading his privacy.

&gt; Nowhere is this more apparent than in the privacy of man’s finances. A simple subpoena reveals what he earned, how he earned it, and when he bought that pregnancy test because the girl he’s sleeping with was worried. His government can and will give his savings a haircut for no apparent reason. And without any cause, his bank may deem it necessary to shut his account, complaining loudly that he is too “high risk” for them to service.

&gt; Today we say no more. No more shall the courts of the land cajole or force us into revealing the most intimate details of our finances. No more shall a government or a rule of law take what we have worked for with our hands. No more shall a corporate institution run by fat cats choose whether or not we are able to transact.

I'm EXTREMELY well known in the Bitcoin space, you can [check my WoT presence as an indication](http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewratingdetail.php?nick=fluffypony).

I can assure you that I know none of the CryptoNote developers, nor do I know the developer behind BBR, QCN or FCN.

Of the other Monero core team members we have individuals such as [tacotime who have been around since June 2011](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=19270) and is also involved as the lead developer on MC2, [othe who is a key developer on Vertcoin](https://vertcoin.org/team.html), [smooth who has been around since May 2011](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=13813), and [David Latapie who is the ""team founder"" for Mintcoin](http://mintcoin.cc).

Obviously we cannot speak for any other coins besides XMR, but your conclusions are provably false. For instance: your claim that there will be a ""floodgate of 100s of new additions"" doesn't need any sort of blessing from the CryptoNote developers. Heck, we don't consult with them at all on Monero (not for lack of trying, mind you). Bitcoin, too, has experienced a ""floodgate of 100s of new additions"", but has Bitcoin suffered for it?

Distribution was not rigged in favor of the dev team or the earliest adopters.  In addition the community seems very engaged to contribute in any way they can.

I have to say I really do think Bytecoin is a branding challenge due to inevitable mainstream confusion getting it muddled with Bitcoin. Darkcoin similarly will have an uphill struggle separating itself from the darkweb. Incidentally, the only way an anonymous coin is going to succeed in the mainstream is by proving it doesn't have nefarious intentions connected with tax evasion, money laundering, drugs, terrorism etc. Very difficult to play the libertarian argument when you're called Darkcoin.

Occasionally I encountered a challenge-response from CloudFlare when testing.

&gt; still no windows 32bit client to use (people like me are stuck)

32-bit support went away when the amount of memory consumed by the in-RAM version exceeded 4gb. Now that we have the blockchainDB version the next tagged release will add 32-bit support back in. You are more than welcome to compile it yourself, or contribute to the development of 32-bit compatibility.

&gt; bought myself a mac. downloaded the client. errors and doesn't work

There's a known issue with 0.8.8.6 that affects some OS X users. Thankfully, compiling it yourself is pretty trivial on a Mac.

There is also precedent for this - Bitcoin had a network fork occur when they moved from BerkeleyDB to LevelDB due to BerkeleyDB unexpectedly being buggy and rejecting a block that was actually valid. I do not suspect we are likely to have a similar occurrence, but that incident is obviously on our minds.

To get to the meat of your question: of course this affects how miners relay transactions - received transactions and blocks require database access to be verified (eg. verify there are no key image violations), and thus have to be processed single-threaded in order. If the database version ends up dead-locking because of a rush of transactions / blocks *then new transactions / blocks can't be verified* and thus won't be relayed. When the deadlock is resolved mining nodes could find themselves secluded from the rest of the network, collectively mining a dead chain. Meanwhile in-RAM nodes will have just kept on chugging away, and if there is sufficient disparity between the two groups we will have an ugly fork that may take many hours to resolve (if at all).",,5,xmr,t1_cru0aoz,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Perfectly secure cryptography exists (one-time pads) but the size of the keys *must be at least as large* as the size of the messages. If we are willing to allow for imperfectly secure, but still computationally nasty, cryptography,  we can make keys smaller. But there is a trade-off. As keys get smaller, codes leak more and more information.   Bitcoin has relatively small keys,  but Bitcoin is linkable and traceable.  Monero has large keys and unconditional unlinkability... but there are still some traceability issues. Zero knowledge techniques are massive but leak even less information.

So,  yeah, someone may be able to come up with a reduction in blockchain size,  but I suspect that it will just be by a constant rather than any significant reduction. Sublinear ring signatures would be nice,  though... edited to add: due to Moore's law, I think it will be unnecessary in a few years anyway.

Think about it. The address is just a reference on the blockchain. All the wallet software does is create an address for you and give you the keys to go ""hey, this address is mine!"" and subsequently spend the coins owned by that address.

Essentially, your address doesn't exist on the blockchain until someone sends you money. (or you earn some rewards for mining).

And I just confirmed by running simplewallet on my machine without a daemon. 

so, essentially, you could run simplewallet, make an address, and then deposit funds to that address immediately. 


Myself, I would want to make sure the coins make it to my address, because, you know, this is all magic internet money. 

Then you could go to mymonero.com (if you trust mymonero.) with your word seed, enter that into the thingy, and then have access to your home-PC generated wallet on mymonero. And no need to pay the 10 XMR fee because if you just generated your address, you don't have any transactions to scan for.

If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

As I mentioned in my reply to Hizonner just now, that's ONLY true if addresses are one-time or secret. Reusable addresses are actually a protection, because if Edward Snowden's address is public knowledge then your knowing it or having it on your phone cannot be an offence (not without LEA or whoever grossly overplaying their hand).

&gt; But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

It is just obfuscation, in a sense, but it's also not *that* weak, because an exchange (for instance) will then have a different ""address"" for each person, so it's very unlikely they'll ever publish their address without a payment ID.

To illustrate at a very basic, unstealthed level: let's say my address is ABC. Let's say Poloniex's address is DEF. Poloniex will no longer tell me to ""make a payment to DEF using payment ID 714"", they'll say ""make a payment to DEF714"". Your deposit address on Poloniex will be DEF837. Bob's address will be DEF419. Even if you are proficient and you can unpack the address to ""DEF"" searching for it won't reveal anything because Poloniex will never have publicly listed just that address for payment.

Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

&gt; At least in my case, I'm not asking to force everybody to use single-purpose addresses. I just would like an easier way of producing them that doesn't force me to incur extra fees or write my own wallet.

If you want to play around with bitmonerod and simplewallet, do so, but if you're not comfortable with command line interfaces, you are probably better off trusting Poloniex for now for actual storage of coin.  With a long password and 2FA, your account at Poloniex should be very secure, and then your only risk is with Poloniex itself being compromised (which unfortunately has happened before)...

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing. To make matters worse, we spent the first 6 months with completely mixed objectives, whilst still coming to grips with cryptography and a codebase we were unfamiliar with, whilst still patching a never-ending list of rapidly emerging issues, whilst getting to know *each other* as members of the core team, whilst still having to work to make a living.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets. So we start researching a bloom-filter style viewkey lookup, then we get hammered on ""breaking exploits"" from BCX. So we start figuring out what the exploit could-possibly-maybe-not-sure-who-knows-be, then we actually do get attacked. So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero  
https://github.com/tippero/tippero  
https://github.com/roosmaa/go-monero

https://github.com/openalias/openalias-api  
https://github.com/Jojatekok/MoneroGui.Net  
https://github.com/jwinterm/lightWallet

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

This is uninteresting information. Things you are ignoring:

1) [Change](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change). Sum of inputs = sum of outputs + fees. But every denominated amount is contained in its own address so you don't know how much was sent back. Say I have a $20 bill and owe you $9.23. On the blockchain this looks like $20 was broken up into a bunch of little amounts, but no one can tell how much went to you and how much went back to me.

(By the way, Monero doesn't just always do 1.23 = 1 + 0.2 + 0.03, it also does other combinations like 0.6+0.4+0.2+0.002+0.001 etc.).

2) Aside from the ring signatures used to receive 123.456 XMR and to send it out, other users are performing ring signatures that may use your outputs. In the intervening time between your send and receive, your outputs could have been mixed with other users. In fact, even after you send it to a new wallet, your 20, 3, 0.4, etc. are forever in the blockchain getting mixed into transactions. It can never be known when even one of these denominated amounts was truly spent.

With these two points, it's a pretty big stretch to try to connect any two transactions by appealing to human psychology. You could maybe try that argument in a network with a 100 users. Any larger and credibility quickly goes down.

Of course, you could just render this psychological appeal moot by breaking your 123.456 XMR in 2 sends to your new wallet (they're unlinkable because of one-time addresses). I personally wouldn't even bother. :P",,1,xmr,t1_ck4uj7c,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

Truth is we are not trying to merely create a GUI, as in a GUI wrapper. Fact is these simple wrappers already exist (Neozaru, Jojatekok and jwinterm's and we could probably use Bitcoin wallet, like Pebblecoin does).

What we are trying to build is **scalable** GUI software. And *scalable* is the hard part, not *GUI*.

## What is scalable?

* Mnemonic seed for increased security ([why](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/isnt-mnemonic-seed-and-inability-change-words-security-holes)).
* Low RAM footprint (""the DB"", presently [Symas Lightning MDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) but later a lot others, since we built a database API).
* e-commerce prerequisites, notably for payment processors.
* Low bandwith footprint (a framework for SPV, like Electrum). The [remote node](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/how-use-remote-node) provides a similar experience in that one doesn't have to download the whole blockchain, but this is where the similarities end and SPV would be lighter than a remote node.
- Much better understood (thus secure) and refactored code. This is behind-the-scene stuff and not sexy, but when it comes to securing your money, this matters. The Monero Protocol is sound, but we are not that comfortable with the source code we inherited in April (and improved since then). Note: we are pretty demanding on security, so when I say that ""we are not that comfortable"", this means the security is already high, just not high enough :)
- Gitian binaries
- Various mainstream users niceties, such as an address book, an easy way to do bookeeping (including easily report to tax offices, because Monero is not meant just for l33t haX0r, but for everyone, including legal persons like corporations, NGO, political parties...)
- Viewkey for optional transparency (see fluffy quote on Three Pilllars)
- Have a solid foundation for easy improvements later on (like third-parties improvements). Because once the (scalable) GUI wallet will be there, we expect things to accelerate - and we rather be ready for the acceleration. Fasten your seatbelt, Dorothy. 

## Why is scalable important?

Because it is one of the three pillars :)

More seriously, because once the official GUI wallet will be there, visibility will increase a lot. Which means more users who know nothing about Monero and later not even about cryptocurrencies. These people won't give a second thought. One does only one first impression. It *must* be the right one. Hence the necessity for a wallet than can handle the load. Be scalable, not that much on a technical standpoint than on a, say, ""political"" standpoint.

We had a discussion early on about decentralised governance within Monero, and decided there was no ""good fit"" for any system just yet. The best we can do is take the voting / funding of enhancements away from our control (via the Forum Funding System), and add some other bits to make code and protocol governance more ""decentralised"" (more on that soon).

But we currently are, and will remain for the time being, the ""benevolent dictator for life"". This is a model that has served Linux well, and we believe it is best suited to making the hard decisions required in a cryptocurrency (and, more specifically, to make decisions as a core team that may not be popular with many people, such as when we decided *not* to change the emission curve).

If, in future, the community decides we're doing a bad job they will replace us. If, in future, we find a better decentralised governance system we will switch to that. None of this is set in stone, but it is ""for the foreseeable future"" or ""until something better comes along.

&gt; Right now the devs are in accord, and all is well. What if in seven years a major rift happens as a result of government intervention into the Monero project. How will we determine who has the 'right' to update the Monero client?

I spoke to this on the Monero forum, so here you go:

""Let's pretend we were facing the same situation as Bitcoin, with a polarised decision that has to be made. It's very unlikely that 1 of the 7 core team members could act like Gavin, because the division would be clear (not so with Bitcoin where there is this misconception that ""only Blockstream devs disagree with Gavin"" or ""everyone that matters agrees with Gavin"" when meanwhile, back at the ranch, he's the only one of the 5 core maintainers that wants the 20mb limit right now). But even so, let's imagine it's 3 vs 3 on the decision with 1 abstain, and the community is torn.

Now here's the clincher: *with planned hard forks we could very easily put the code in and then measure full node uptake over 6 months*. Since the code only kicks in after the 6 month window *and* the node observes a sufficient percentage of blocks on the new version, it simply wouldn't enable that code if there is not sufficient uptake. This could be modified to be both % of mined blocks + % of connected nodes for the sake of fairness. We therefore let the miners and users decide, and we can always nuke that code in the next hard fork update.""

&gt; Perhaps if you are going to create a social framework around Monero (and scheduled hard forks are definitely a social frame work) then a constitution needs to be drawn up as well.

There will be something like this drawn up, that is a discussion we'll open up soon.

&gt; And like it or not, after a certain point (four years sounds good) you are going to need to have a system in place for elections and appointments to the board of developers.

That's exactly what I was alluding to with the BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) thing - we probably won't increase it at all, unless we really have to, and then we'll handle that within the core team. It is very unlikely that there will be so many others who come along that understand decentralised security systems that they become integral and have to sit on the core team (plus not everyone wants to have that responsibility). That is not to say we won't be transparent, but I think that it is best to avoid too formalised a structure there. That having been said, there are peripheral organisations, such as MEW, that can have all sorts of formal structure and that have our ear. Similarly, we could create something akin to the LSB (Linux Standard Base) which provides even more formal control over implementations and interaction mechanisms.

&gt; I know that sounds dire, but what we are trying to do is take humans out of the equation, right? So we should be very cautious about rushing to put humans back into it, even if it's a necessary and rational move.

You're trying to take humans out at the wrong layer.

Open source projects absolutely need guidance and decision making. With something like Monero it's even more important that there's a centralised structure to meet the paradigm that journalists and companies inevitably expect. Having this centralised ""benevolent dictator"" structure is completely fine, as long as we aren't precluding others from making a meaningful contribution (more on that soon).

Where the human element should be taken out is in the network consensus level. Right now Bitcoin is getting this wrong. If Bitcoin needs to hard fork they have to first convince everyone to upgrade. With the combination of the core team as benevolent dictators and the 6-month hard fork rollover we can instead push out a fork and then spend 6 months observing the uptake and acting accordingly.

Oh and before there are any thoughts given to us being in ""control"" there are two things that should be born in mind:

1. We are in control as stewards of the project. That's the nature of the situation, and it won't change. We deserve that control, partly because we are not complete morons and are doing a decent job, but also because we've sunk more time, money, and energy into Monero than anyone else.

2. We inherited that role from thankful_for_today, so we're VERY cognisant that we can be ousted from the community and a new group can take it over. This means that, whilst we are capable of making firm decisions, we are also able to step back and reverse decisions where they aren't met with broad community acceptance.

&gt; if 6-month hard forks become a thing, two competing groups in the future will both fight for their right to update the client

But in the end nodes and miners will decide. Two competing groups would actually make it easier - we could host both downloads on getmonero.org and then miners would be able to more easily select the one they want to vote for:)

Also let's not forget that this structure is not necessarily ""for life"". We will do this until it is no longer workable, and then we'll do something else. The 6 month rolling fork means that we can easily change the software, and changing the systems and core team is also not insurmountable.",,10,xmr,t1_crp8t9s,t5_31hbr,moderator,1432933724,,,,,,,,,,,

I will try to use our time productively by sharing some educational information that could hopefully trump this boring elevator music:

Governments are printing paper money like confetti and in the process they are diluting our purchasing power of our savings with inflation.  In the process the bankers are getting richer and governments are misappropriating taxpayer money whilst the poor have to bear the financial tax burden of bailouts of the financial system for the horrible behaviour of the corruptible politicians.  Everyone can associate with the induced business cycles by the Federal Reserve System.  I am sure you are most familiar with what happened in 2008 during the world-wide recession, Cyprus bank bail ins and numerous other examples.

With the invention of Bitcoin the power of money creation is systematically eroded from governments.   The cryptographically protected decentralised ledger of Bitcoin is a revolutionary breakthrough because it converts money into an incorruptible protocol, the use of which is totally voluntary in contrast with the fiat money that is issued by governments that’s  use is violently being enforced via legal tender laws and gangs with guns i.e. police and military.

Bitcoin is undeniably a great achievement in generating a worldwide decentralised consensus ledger in a frictionless way, which forms a very sounds basis for a monetary platform.  However, the traceability of transactions through the Bitcoin ledger undermines financial privacy that in the current digital age of Orwellian government surveillance is undermining human liberty.  Financial privacy is as much a human right as any other and needs protection, hence the invention of Monero.

Monero’s cryptographic protocol achieves what Bitcoin was intended to but couldn’t because of fundamental cryptographic limitations.  In the long run the anonymous Monero protocol could mean more for financial freedom and liberty than Bitcoin.  Whilst Bitcoin could end the reliance on a parasitic Federal Reserve System, Monero could also end government and third party spying on your everyday financial transactions.

So, my hope is that you would feel intrigued and inquisitive in Googling the revolution that is Monero for yourself.  See you on the online forums.  Google will lead you there.

Have a great day and I hope this elevator trip will be most memorable.

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets.

So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

But you haven't spun one that's feasible yet. I'm not trying to be antagonistic, so hear me out:)

My address is public and known, I posted it above. I use it as my withdrawal address on Monero exchanges, on ShapeShift.io, and (presumably) on some future eBay-like market when I sell my Star Wars Episode I Stap and Battledroid teaser toy. All of those entities can be subpoenaed and they can reveal all of my ""earnings"".

*But that's all that an attacker can gleam* -

&gt; Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming and outgoing transactions

This is where you're misunderstanding. The viewkey reveals my incoming transactions, but NOT my outgoing transactions. So *at best* an attacker can determine the source of some of my income, but that's where it ends.

The viewkey isn't a magic key that reveals all transactions, it's a magic key that reveals all outputs you control. Right now those outputs can be spent at mixin 0, which would reveal that the output is spent/unspent, but once [MRL-0004](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf) has been implemented that will no longer be the case.

So with this information let's go back to your example:

&gt; If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

&gt; ... and that means Alice is exposed by Bob's approach to single-purpose wallets.

In order to know that Alice has been paying Bob they'd have to ask Alice, not Bob. There's no way for Bob to prove where the funds he received came from, he can only prove that he has control over them. Only Alice can prove ownership of the transactions she initiated.

So Alice is exposed because LEA asked her for her data and she complied.

Similarly, if LEA instead approach Bob, they can see ""Bob has received a string of payments"", but not who the payments are from.

Obviously LEA can beat the information out of both Bob and Alice, but Monero is not a solution to [rubber-hose cryptanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis).

&gt; By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues.

Monero is far from mature, so taken in its current state this is an unsolvable problem: if an advertiser/insurer/enemy knows your email address they can go and offer Poloniex a bucket load of money for your data, and come up with some idea of your personal Monero holdings. But when Monero is mature there will be too many moving targets for that, and knowing your ""net worth"" isn't worth the expenditure. It's easier to just figure out where you live and spy on you:-P",,2,xmr,t1_cqn3vny,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing. To make matters worse, we spent the first 6 months with completely mixed objectives, whilst still coming to grips with cryptography and a codebase we were unfamiliar with, whilst still patching a never-ending list of rapidly emerging issues, whilst getting to know *each other* as members of the core team, whilst still having to work to make a living.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets. So we start researching a bloom-filter style viewkey lookup, then we get hammered on ""breaking exploits"" from BCX. So we start figuring out what the exploit could-possibly-maybe-not-sure-who-knows-be, then we actually do get attacked. So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero  
https://github.com/tippero/tippero  
https://github.com/roosmaa/go-monero  
https://github.com/netmonk/moneronjs  
https://github.com/TheKoziTwo/xmr-integration

https://github.com/openalias/openalias-api  
https://github.com/Jojatekok/MoneroGui.Net  
https://github.com/jwinterm/lightWallet

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

&gt; We are now confident in our ability to deliver the devices, but in order to ensure we can stick to the deadline we set; we have set the new shipping deadline as **July 4th**. This gives us time to deal with any unforeseen complications, and gives us breathing space in terms of putting them together

If you have 1.23 bitcoin (or 1.23 monero) that should actually be broken up into three UTXO's... a UTXO of 1.00, a UTXO of 0.2, and a UTXO of 0.03. And if you decide to send me 0.03 BTC, you actually send me the relevant UTXO. You broadcast a transaction on the network that will look something like ""I send  following UTXO to MathAndFerrets, this UTXO right here!"" and you sign this message/cheque with the private key responsible for the 0.03 BTC. 

Whenever a miner hears about that transaction, they will comb through the blockchain and verify that the 0.03BTC you are trying to send to me has not yet been sent away to anyone else, and, if it's cool, they will bundle it into a block of other transactions that are also legitimate. A UTXO is a bookkeeping/computer science concept.

Second, short answer, stealth addresses still shield everyone, but only to the extent that bitcoin does so. And, as you may have seen, bitcoin isn't technically anonymous, because circumstantial forensic analysis of the blockchain can reveal information about a transaction. In fact, data mining essentially removes all anonymity from bitcoin. Nail one drug dealer who uses bitcoin and you nail all clients of theirs, even if those clients were ""smart"" and used a coin mixer, because coin mixing is NOT cryptographic security, it's a shell game.

Third is the hardest question and most fun.  A UTXO (unspent transaction output) is technically what you own when you own XMR or bitcoin. Your private key is the key that allows you to transmit that transaction output to someone else; once you broadcast your transaction on the network, everyone makes sure that UTXO has not yet been spent, and once that is accomplished, the receiver will get a new UTXO. In bitcoin, the old UTXO's ... dissipate or are deleted, or at least can be forgotten after awhile. In Monero, not so.

When you start talking ring sigs, things get more complicated than the messages above. The message being broadcast becomes something like ""One of the UTXOs from the set {0.03 BTC owned by cqm, 0.03 BTC owned by warren buffet, 0.03 BTC owned by bruce wayne}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC1093073. Furthermore, the image of the key used to sign this message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah."" (Key images are usually just hashes of the original key)

Now, when a miner hears the message, they can't really comb through the blockchain looking for whether or not cqm really owns the UTXO of 0.03 BTC to send to me. That's what they would do with BTC, but they can't do it with monero. After all, it's not even clear which of these UTXO's is being sent - is it cqm's, or Bruce Wayne's, or Warren Buffets?  The miner has no idea which member of the set is sending, and only knows the receiving address, not the receiver. However, the miner CAN comb through the blockchain and look for previous usages of the key image H3107u3830830blahblahblah, it's a nice, easy thing to check. If it has been used before, that's a double-spend. Things get more information-intensive because every time YOU hear about a transaction, you will scramble to check if you can access address ABC to see if the money was sent to you.

Anyway, the number of possible-sending individuals OTHER than you is the number of mix-ins. A transaction with mix-in = 0 has no one else mixed in, and so no anonymity. It looks like this:

""One of the UTXOs from the set {this UTXO owned by cqm right here}, will be sent to SOMEONE at the address ABC. Furthermore, the image of the key I will use to sign the message is H3107u3830830blahblahblah"" and, of course, it's clear to everyone watching that cqm sent the money.

Finally, how do chain reactions work?

Well, if, all of a sudden, the UTXO's owned by Bruce Wayne and Warren Buffet are NO LONGER AVAILABLE because they have been spent NON-anonymously, then every ring signature created using those as obfuscating mix-ins are no longer really ring-sigs, they're just normal sigs. I mean, you can tell ... ""hey, this sig says bruce wayne coulda signed it, but bruce wayne doesn't own this money anymore... so he's out... and Warren Buffet sent this money to the Bahamas... so he's out... this musta been cqm.""

I'm a developer for Monero, and I do appreciate your feedback!  However, as a developer, I've seen its dirty little secrets.  As a fork from Bytecoin, Monero has inherited Bytecoin's code.  This code is functional, and I fully appreciate that as a starting point.  That said, it is far from what Monero should and will be.  I like the idea of building hype around Monero, and I hope that happens Soon™.  That said, I won't complain if that takes a little while.  I personally am working on very nice improvements to Monero, and would love to have them done/tested/merged by the time Monero gets any hype.

So that's not to say that I don't want hype, I do, but I'm not in a terrible hurry.  The concepts behind Monero, and almost as/more importantly, the team behind Monero, are in it for the long haul.  And that's awesome!  :D",,5,xmr,t1_ciu5br1,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).

4. Boot into your bootable OS, install the dependencies if necessary.
5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.

There are two aspects to this. At the moment, when you create a new wallet it generates two keys: your ""spend"" key and your ""view"" key. Now because this is unfinished software, the ""view"" key is shown once on creation and never again (we're fixing that:)

The view key (public key) is attached to transactions and would allow someone to view transactions you have made. The tooling will exist soon that will allow you to publish your public key and will allow someone else to use it on monerochain.info or other blockchain explorers and see all of your transactions and your balance. Moreover, we will add tooling that will allow you to publish the 1-time key *for a specific transaction*, thus allowing confirmation of the specifics of that transaction by an exchange or other party.

All of this is possible for any transactions that have already been made, so it's not like we have to make breaking changes to the code or hard-fork to support this, but we do need to add tooling so you can extract the relevant info from simplewallet (and other wallet tools) and then provide RPC calls and other information so the blockchain explorers can add tooling to view this information:)",,4,xmr,t1_ci1dhk1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

There's a possibility that this is the last time we'll see Monero at the 0.005-ish level, it's already at number 4 on the Mintpal voting list 7 days after being added (through a combination of heavy voting and paid-for votes by supporters of Monero). *If* the price corrects before it goes on Mintpal I doubt it'll correct very far down.

As a first stop, I'll reiterate [my post from Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.msg8246348#msg8246348) on creating a secure offline wallet:

1. Take any machine you have lying around, even your normal workstation. You may find it easier to use an older computer that has no wifi or bluetooth if you're particularly paranoid.
2. Create a Linux or Windows bootable disk, and make sure you have the Monero binaries on the same disk or on a second disk (for Linux make sure you have also downloaded copies of the dependencies you will need, libboost1.55 and miniupnpc for instance).
3. Disconnect the network and/or Internet cables from your machine, physically remove the wifi card or switch the wifi/bluetooth off on a laptop if possible.

5. Copy the Monero binaries to to a RAM disk (/dev/shm in Linux, Windows bootable ISOs normally have a Z: drive or something)
6. Don't run the Monero daemon. Instead, using the command line, use simplewallet to create a new wallet.
7. When prompted for a name, give it any name, it doesn't really matter.
8. When prompted for a password, type in like 50 - 100 random characters. Don't worry that you don't know the password, just make it LONG.

10. Write down (on your phone, on paper, on another computer, wherever you want) your address and view key.

**Creating a secure, online wallet**

Create a new wallet on your computer, using a reasonably secure password or passphrase, and write down (on paper) your 24 word mnemonic seed. You can transact using your wallet, knowing that if the wallet files are stolen it is extremely unlikely that an attacker will be able to brute-force your password (wallet files are quite heavily encrypted).

The same process of securing your 24 word seed as with the offline wallet applies: write out several copies of it so that you have an offsite copy (eg. a bank deposit box). Due to the nature of the key you can write it as part of something else - eg. write a fake love letter to your wife so that the 24 words on the left hand side are your key or whatever.

I do not believe that inference to be valid. Allowing the use of proper single-purpose addresses in no way forces all Monero transactions to be used for illicit purposes. Neither does the use of single-purpose addresses imply that something sinister is going on.

I am not advocating for Monero to be used for evil. I simply would prefer it to be a tool that can be used to gain as much privacy as reasonably possible.

In an ideal world, the payment ID addresses would be ""hardened"" somehow so they can't be picked apart.

The Red Cross can publish a regular Monero address. If single-purpose addresses happen to double as payment ID addresses, merchants will want to use those. People can hand out regular Monero addresses to relatives and acquaintances. The type of address shouldn't allow any kind of inference whether a transaction is evil or good.

In any case, let me give you one completely innocuous example for why I would like to be able to generate addresses more easily. I use different nicknames and email addresses for each website that requires me to register, such as various forums etc. Password managers allow this kind of thing to be done without becoming too painful. If I go and hand out the same address everywhere, my separated identities are suddenly tied together. Making a new wallet/account for each website is a lot more work than adding one more entry to a password manager.

I do recognize the usefulness of the dictator approach, and in fact, a benevolent and wise dictator is the best form of government or management.  
  
The problems occur when that dictator is replaced with someone less capable that still wields the same power.  
  
As you go forward, please understand that the community isn't hoping and predicting that Monero will reach a Dogecoin-esque 100 million dollar market cap.  We (and I'm sure you) are envisioning that if everything works out the way we think, Monero's ""market cap"" will easily surpass the trillions.  This means that governments *will* get involved, and will be very interested in exactly who is pulling the strings behind a dominant form of money on Earth, and how they are doing it.  (though I'm sure you have already forseen this + other tinfoil conspiracies).   
  
Second, as you probably already know and have seen in systems, they are highly malleable in the beginning and become more resistant to change as they grow.  Governments, human brains, information networks, etc.  Monero will be no different.  
  
Please plan that it will be trivial to hard fork six months from now, and (even if scheduled) a major pain-in-the-ass six years from now.  
  
Perhaps it doesn't even bear saying, and don't take this the wrong way: you devs are doing the thankless hard lifting and amassing unimaginable talent and effort together for this project.  But precisely because armchair speculator/critics like us are not immersed in the trenches, we have a unique perspective on the matter.  
  
That being said, it's **essential** that the team focus on the most crucial changes early, and get them in place.  Fun and fancy can come later, but key protocol changes have to happen in the first few hard forks to alleviate exponential suffering later.  **It also means the next 24 months of software development will be the most crucial in the entire history of Monero** (which could be a very long time).   
  
*You have roughly two years to establish the most essential parts of one of the most important protocols in our species' history*.  That is fucking awesome, and I'm sure the gravity of that task weighs firmly on each of you.  I wish I could contribute more, but enthusiasm and gab are my gifts, not code and cryptography.  
  

  
It would seem as if you already understand this though, as you have a well designed road map of priorities, and the fact that the GUI has been currently sacrificed in favor of other, under-the-hood items bodes well.  
  
Keep doing a great job, and please continue to think about the long term ramifications of every decision you make.  You hold in your hands a similar power and responsibility that the fabled ""forefathers of America"" held, as they designed the US Government from the ground up.  
  
Funny that one of the most important developments in the human race is happening right here on a little subreddit with 1900 subscribers.

For instance, if a miner could purchase equipment upgrades in XMR, pay his electricity in XMR, and pay his rent in XMR, that's his costs covered. Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system. With fiat and BTC settlement bridges (ie. that have eventual settlement, not instant settlement) this can happen without the parties even knowing or caring what happens, and it can happen without affecting the price much - or at all.

Ultimately the aim is to create something useful and usable that is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. That is not to dissuade speculators entirely, but they will have to get in at the sub-$50 mark if they want to see speculative growth.

The issue is that people will record and share the addresses to which they have sent money, completely out of band, and therefore completely beyond the possibility of Monero helping them.

That's why I said ""keep dossiers"", not ""scan the blockchain"".

If the software doesn't support ephemeral addresses well, then people will use persistent ones. A user will have one address or at most a few.

If persistent, multiuse addreses are normal, then the addresses to which people are making payments become radioactive data. If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

... and that means *Alice* is exposed by *Bob's* approach to single-purpose wallets.

The addresses Alice has been paying may leak because of Alice's ""poor opsec"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of her multisig ""security service"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of one of the dozens of cloud services the average person seems to use for critical purposes these days, or because of software bugs, or for whatever reason. There are lots of places where that sort of thing may end up.

I can spin you dozens of scenarios. Each is probably relatively improbable by itself. But the probability that *some* of them will happen is very high. You can give me mitigation steps the user could take for each of them, outside of the Monero system itself... but taking all the steps to avoid even most of them would be complicated, annoying, error-prone, and potentially expensive.

Mistakes happen all the time, and you have to avoid making them fatal. More than one thing should have to fail before there's a serious problem. It's unreasonable to expect users to take lots of elaborate measures and meet lots of external constraints. If there are measures that need to be taken a significant part of the time, even it's not *all* the time, then the software should take them *for* the user.

Magnifying the effects of ""poor opsec"" is ""poor devsec"".

Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming *and* outgoing transactions. So, for example, if I want to prove that I paid Alice, I also have to disclose that I paid Bob, and, I think, that I got the money from Carol. I have no practical way to know in advance which payments I might have to prove, so I'd better have separate addresses for all of them.

Honestly, from my point of view, the only way to have ""good opsec"" with the wallet you have would be to

1. Create a whole new wallet for every incoming transaction (or at least each payer or related stream of transactions, at a lot finer granularity than my ""identity"")
2. Create another wallet for each *outgoing* transaction, and forward money from the incoming wallets to a single use outgoing wallet before sending it to the final recipient.

All manually. And with backups. That doesn't strike me as being absolutely private with ""very little effort"".

Even worse, I have to rely on all my *counterparties* to go out of their way to do the same sorts of things, knowing that they get basically no support for doing so.

And I don't get this:

&gt; Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked), or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction.

The existing wallet is also ""deterministic"", in that it deterministically uses the same key all the time. If that key leaks, you lose not only all your privacy, but all your money as well. Going to a deterministic multiaddress wallet doesn't increase that risk at all, but it does *reduce* the risk of people linking transactions they shouldn't be able to link.

By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues. However, that said, ""illicit activity"" is kind of in the eye of the beholder. The drug example may have been poorly chosen. Perhaps a better example for Western ears would be that somebody is donating to Falun Gong, or buying porn, or gambling legally in jursisdiction X while dealing with exchanges in jurisdiction Y who are required to freeze ""gambling related"" funds, or buying apostate literature, or...

I have to say I really do think Bytecoin is a branding challenge due to inevitable mainstream confusion getting it muddled with Bitcoin. Darkcoin similarly will have an uphill struggle separating itself from the darkweb.

The issue is that people will record and share the addresses to which they have sent money, completely out of band, and therefore completely beyond the possibility of Monero helping them.

That's why I said ""keep dossiers"", not ""scan the blockchain"".

If the software doesn't support ephemeral addresses well, then people will use persistent ones. A user will have one address or at most a few.

If persistent, multiuse addreses are normal, then the addresses to which people are making payments become radioactive data. If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

... and that means *Alice* is exposed by *Bob's* approach to single-purpose wallets.

The addresses Alice has been paying may leak because of Alice's ""poor opsec"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of her multisig ""security service"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of one of the dozens of cloud services the average person seems to use for critical purposes these days, or because of software bugs, or for whatever reason. There are lots of places where that sort of thing may end up.

I can spin you dozens of scenarios. Each is probably relatively improbable by itself. But the probability that *some* of them will happen is very high. You can give me mitigation steps the user could take for each of them, outside of the Monero system itself... but taking all the steps to avoid even most of them would be complicated, annoying, error-prone, and potentially expensive.

Mistakes happen all the time, and you have to avoid making them fatal. More than one thing should have to fail before there's a serious problem. It's unreasonable to expect users to take lots of elaborate measures and meet lots of external constraints. If there are measures that need to be taken a significant part of the time, even it's not *all* the time, then the software should take them *for* the user.

Magnifying the effects of ""poor opsec"" is ""poor devsec"".

Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming *and* outgoing transactions. So, for example, if I want to prove that I paid Alice, I also have to disclose that I paid Bob, and, I think, that I got the money from Carol. I have no practical way to know in advance which payments I might have to prove, so I'd better have separate addresses for all of them.

Honestly, from my point of view, the only way to have ""good opsec"" with the wallet you have would be to

1. Create a whole new wallet for every incoming transaction (or at least each payer or related stream of transactions, at a lot finer granularity than my ""identity"")
2. Create another wallet for each *outgoing* transaction, and forward money from the incoming wallets to a single use outgoing wallet before sending it to the final recipient.

All manually. And with backups. That doesn't strike me as being absolutely private with ""very little effort"".

Even worse, I have to rely on all my *counterparties* to go out of their way to do the same sorts of things, knowing that they get basically no support for doing so.

And I don't get this:

&gt; Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked), or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction.

The existing wallet is also ""deterministic"", in that it deterministically uses the same key all the time. If that key leaks, you lose not only all your privacy, but all your money as well. Going to a deterministic multiaddress wallet doesn't increase that risk at all, but it does *reduce* the risk of people linking transactions they shouldn't be able to link.

By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues. However, that said, ""illicit activity"" is kind of in the eye of the beholder. The drug example may have been poorly chosen. Perhaps a better example for Western ears would be that somebody is donating to Falun Gong, or buying porn, or gambling legally in jursisdiction X while dealing with exchanges in jurisdiction Y who are required to freeze ""gambling related"" funds, or buying apostate literature, or...

Think about it. The address is just a reference on the blockchain. All the wallet software does is create an address for you and give you the keys to go ""hey, this address is mine!"" and subsequently spend the coins owned by that address.

Essentially, your address doesn't exist on the blockchain until someone sends you money. (or you earn some rewards for mining).

And I just confirmed by running simplewallet on my machine without a daemon. 

so, essentially, you could run simplewallet, make an address, and then deposit funds to that address immediately.

If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

As I mentioned in my reply to Hizonner just now, that's ONLY true if addresses are one-time or secret. Reusable addresses are actually a protection, because if Edward Snowden's address is public knowledge then your knowing it or having it on your phone cannot be an offence (not without LEA or whoever grossly overplaying their hand).

&gt; But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

It is just obfuscation, in a sense, but it's also not *that* weak, because an exchange (for instance) will then have a different ""address"" for each person, so it's very unlikely they'll ever publish their address without a payment ID.

To illustrate at a very basic, unstealthed level: let's say my address is ABC. Let's say Poloniex's address is DEF. Poloniex will no longer tell me to ""make a payment to DEF using payment ID 714"", they'll say ""make a payment to DEF714"". Your deposit address on Poloniex will be DEF837. Bob's address will be DEF419. Even if you are proficient and you can unpack the address to ""DEF"" searching for it won't reveal anything because Poloniex will never have publicly listed just that address for payment.

Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

&gt; At least in my case, I'm not asking to force everybody to use single-purpose addresses. I just would like an easier way of producing them that doesn't force me to incur extra fees or write my own wallet.

Alice leaks an entire transaction? Including cryptographic proof thereof? Or does Alice accidentally Tweet ""paid 100 XMR for cocaine to 4ABCDEFG""? If she's that dumb Monero isn't going to protect her, definitely not by inconveniencing the crap out of everyone.

&gt; This is how investigations work. You combine the information you have.

So this is how Monero works: we provide the best privacy we can whilst not making Monero a complete pain to use, and still making things like optional and voluntary transparency available.

There's a level of corner cases we simply *can't* prevent, including things like Ed25519 being compromised by the NSA, or the FBI buying up 83% of the output set, or Alice putting her transaction history online.

Of course, if any of these become an actual / recurrent problem we'll see if we can mitigate them, and if not we'll raise the red flag. But our main aim with Monero is, first and foremost, to provide something that is *useful and usable* whilst still retaining as much privacy as is reasonably possible.

Monero is not trying to compete with Zerocash. In 20 or 30 years when Zerocash's cryptography has been more thoroughly vetted then I fully expect it make Monero redundant. Between now and then, though, our aim is not to deal in absolutes and not to preemptively cover every edge case at the cost of usability.

I remain unconvinced that effectively breaking the viewkey functionality and overcomplicating the wallet system provides anything more than absolutely peripheral benefits whilst preventing very few privacy-breaking edge cases. Also such a change is largely pointless unless everyone is using it, and I can guarantee someone will just release a forked / patched version that disables the functionality because logic.",,1,xmr,t1_cqnkm50,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

The issue is that people will record and share the addresses to which they have sent money, completely out of band, and therefore completely beyond the possibility of Monero helping them.

That's why I said ""keep dossiers"", not ""scan the blockchain"".

If the software doesn't support ephemeral addresses well, then people will use persistent ones. A user will have one address or at most a few.

If persistent, multiuse addreses are normal, then the addresses to which people are making payments become radioactive data. If Alice pays Bob, and somebody gets that address, then instead of learning ""Alice made a payment to this random address"", or even ""Alice made a string of payments to this random address"", it often becomes ""Alice has been paying Bob"". Everybody who deals with Bob sees that same address, and that means it's basically public information.

... and that means *Alice* is exposed by *Bob's* approach to single-purpose wallets.

The addresses Alice has been paying may leak because of Alice's ""poor opsec"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of her multisig ""security service"", or because of the ""poor opsec"" of one of the dozens of cloud services the average person seems to use for critical purposes these days, or because of software bugs, or for whatever reason. There are lots of places where that sort of thing may end up.

I can spin you dozens of scenarios. Each is probably relatively improbable by itself. But the probability that *some* of them will happen is very high. You can give me mitigation steps the user could take for each of them, outside of the Monero system itself... but taking all the steps to avoid even most of them would be complicated, annoying, error-prone, and potentially expensive.

Mistakes happen all the time, and you have to avoid making them fatal. More than one thing should have to fail before there's a serious problem. It's unreasonable to expect users to take lots of elaborate measures and meet lots of external constraints. If there are measures that need to be taken a significant part of the time, even it's not *all* the time, then the software should take them *for* the user.

Magnifying the effects of ""poor opsec"" is ""poor devsec"".

Another issue is that, if I understand things correctly, my view key is tied to my single address, and it discloses incoming *and* outgoing transactions. So, for example, if I want to prove that I paid Alice, I also have to disclose that I paid Bob, and, I think, that I got the money from Carol. I have no practical way to know in advance which payments I might have to prove, so I'd better have separate addresses for all of them.

Honestly, from my point of view, the only way to have ""good opsec"" with the wallet you have would be to

1. Create a whole new wallet for every incoming transaction (or at least each payer or related stream of transactions, at a lot finer granularity than my ""identity"")
2. Create another wallet for each *outgoing* transaction, and forward money from the incoming wallets to a single use outgoing wallet before sending it to the final recipient.

All manually. And with backups. That doesn't strike me as being absolutely private with ""very little effort"".

Even worse, I have to rely on all my *counterparties* to go out of their way to do the same sorts of things, knowing that they get basically no support for doing so.

And I don't get this:

&gt; Building a wallet that doesn't have a reusable address is completely painful, because then it's either deterministic (and thus prone to privacy compromises if your MPK gets leaked), or it's like Bitcoin Core and you have to back your wallet up after every transaction.

The existing wallet is also ""deterministic"", in that it deterministically uses the same key all the time. If that key leaks, you lose not only all your privacy, but all your money as well. Going to a deterministic multiaddress wallet doesn't increase that risk at all, but it does *reduce* the risk of people linking transactions they shouldn't be able to link.

By the way, law enforcement isn't even the main concern here. Advertisers, insurers, employers, personal enemies, are all probably bigger issues. However, that said, ""illicit activity"" is kind of in the eye of the beholder. The drug example may have been poorly chosen. Perhaps a better example for Western ears would be that somebody is donating to Falun Gong, or buying porn, or gambling legally in jursisdiction X while dealing with exchanges in jurisdiction Y who are required to freeze ""gambling related"" funds, or buying apostate literature, or...

* for one, we wanted to get the blockchain out of RAM (at least optionally) because it's starting to max out RAM on people's systems; at worst this means those people can't run monero at all, at best this means a lot of disk thrashing because swap space.
* secondly, we wanted to refactor the blockchain class in the codebase to separate the storage logic from the validation/access logic.  This way we can more easily support many different ways of storing the blockchain (including putting it all back in RAM, if someone wants to).

It's been a long time coming mainly because it's a very complicated refactor (tearing apart, understanding, and restructuring 2k lines of code is...fun).

If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

As I mentioned in my reply to Hizonner just now, that's ONLY true if addresses are one-time or secret. Reusable addresses are actually a protection, because if Edward Snowden's address is public knowledge then your knowing it or having it on your phone cannot be an offence (not without LEA or whoever grossly overplaying their hand).

&gt; But that's just obfuscation. If you are in fact going to build facilities to produce single-purpose addresses, albeit of a weak kind (i.e. they can be turned back into regular addresses with a bit of effort), why not go the whole way?

It is just obfuscation, in a sense, but it's also not *that* weak, because an exchange (for instance) will then have a different ""address"" for each person, so it's very unlikely they'll ever publish their address without a payment ID.

To illustrate at a very basic, unstealthed level: let's say my address is ABC. Let's say Poloniex's address is DEF. Poloniex will no longer tell me to ""make a payment to DEF using payment ID 714"", they'll say ""make a payment to DEF714"". Your deposit address on Poloniex will be DEF837. Bob's address will be DEF419. Even if you are proficient and you can unpack the address to ""DEF"" searching for it won't reveal anything because Poloniex will never have publicly listed just that address for payment.

Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

&gt; At least in my case, I'm not asking to force everybody to use single-purpose addresses. I just would like an easier way of producing them that doesn't force me to incur extra fees or write my own wallet.

We don't really have the funding or manpower to build something like this out, so you'll either have to write it yourself or wait for some time in the far future when we are able to commit resources to it.",,0,xmr,t1_cqnfmzz,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

4. Ah yes, I vaguely remember that.

The bottom line is that Monero doesn't have a cushy premine / instamine to rely on for funding, and we don't have enough volunteers to handle things like cross-platform functional testing, release engineering, devops, continuous integration, and so on.

You are getting excellence in software development and architecture at a big fat cost of nothing, but we are only a handful of people scattered around the globe. If you want things to happen faster you have two options: wait for us to get to it, or do it yourself. If you choose to wait then you have the option of paying for it to go faster, else you have to abide by the timelines of a collective of unpaid, part-time volunteers who also have to work to make a living.",,4,xmr,t1_cr5cb0b,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a massive mindfuck to bitcoiners and the general public because you just basically said your coin is equal to bitcoin in terms of value, and because you are playing fair, you are inviting them aboard and giving them prior notice.  
  
On the other hand, yeah, starting a new ledger sucks, but with all due respect to Satoshi, a ledger began in 2014 (when many more know about crypto) that opens up mining to everyone vs. Becoming an ASIC race *is* fairer.  
  
And as rpiella is fond of saying, even in stocks and commodities you have to hedge, and with speculative tech like this it makes sense that bitcoiners should have to hedge a little in rival technologies.  
  
So I can see both sides of the story.  I think deep down, I'm in Monero to see it reach #2 status, with a market cap of 10% that of bitcoin.  
  
If a zero coin or a quantum coin comes out, I would definitely hedge in those, no matter where Monero took me.

It isn't about the blockchain - you can always simply work off the top block in Bitcoin, Monero or anything else. Rather, it's about the utxoset, i.e. the set of unspent outputs.

In Bitcoin (and Darkcoin and etc.) a spend is always obvious and uniquely identifiable because of the signature. In Monero, you can never know if an output has been spent *precisely because it has true anonymity*. Therefore the set of possibly unspent outputs grows in time. The way around this is to use another data structure, e.g. a hash tree of that set and of the set of unspent key images. This has been discussed in our dev channel, but obviously Monero has more primitive infrastructure needs to sort out at this moment.

I can't comment on Darkcoin's 'untraceability' when it still has no code open sourced. Regardless, the masternode method itself will always be vulnerable to malicious nodes. I find it a bit funny that anyone thinks that imposing a token cost to obtaining a node is a serious barrier for capable institutions.

At a more base level, it doesn't actually do anything you couldn't do yourself in Bitcoin by sending to multiple mixers and hoping at least one isn't corrupt.

You forget, the ""committee of people"" never set out to launch an altcoin. We came together purely by chance, skillset, and timing. To make matters worse, we spent the first 6 months with completely mixed objectives, whilst still coming to grips with cryptography and a codebase we were unfamiliar with, whilst still patching a never-ending list of rapidly emerging issues, whilst getting to know *each other* as members of the core team, whilst still having to work to make a living.

Everything we have done for the first year has been an ongoing, uphill battle. We start working on a new website, but then we get hammered on needing a forum. So we start working on the forum functionality we need, then we get hammered on not knowing the codebase. So we start figuring out the codebase, then we get hammered on blockchain bloat. So we start designing options for combating blockchain bloat, then we get hammered on there not being a GUI. So we start working on a GUI, then we get hammered on there not being an SPV style system for lightweight wallets. So we start researching a bloom-filter style viewkey lookup, then we get hammered on ""breaking exploits"" from BCX. So we start figuring out what the exploit could-possibly-maybe-not-sure-who-knows-be, then we actually do get attacked. So we start refactoring all the C code, then we get hammered on the RAM requirement for the daemon. So we start working on a DBMS-neutral blockchain class and LMDB implementation, then we get hammered on marketing. So we do a bunch of meetups in Europe and a LetsTalkBitcoin interview, then we get hammered on incompetence.

Oh and we don't get paid for any of this, in fact we bleed money and burn through what little Monero we have.

&gt; Instead of making a minimum viable product

When you do that you end up with Bitcointalk and a heavily criticised, legal murky, $1.5 million rewrite. Or an even better example - Bitcoin's move from BDB to leveldb and [the subsequent 6-hour fork of 2013](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/3668/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork/). The ""minimum viable product"" has been done, if we are ever going to provide an alternative to our big brother then we simply cannot start with a minimum viable product.

&gt; the actual plan is a ""complete point of sale system for merchants, consumers"" with a ton of bells and whistles that nobody asked for, or needs, or is even accepted in the cryptocurrency space at all

That is absolute nonsense. We have only ever said the main window will be a complete Monero account management system for powerusers (with functionality that is not too dissimilar from baseline Bitcoin Core), and that the MiniWindow will provide a much simpler interface for newcomers that just want to send and receive with no transaction history or anything. This was the stated goal, and we were well on the way to achieving it, until the block 202 612 attack happened and we completely halted GUI development in order to re-evaluate our priorities. You're welcome.

&gt; It also came with a twitter feed

You mean the cut-and-paste 5 line Qt snippet to demonstrate how we could populate that control? I mean, I guess we could have foregone that and instead spent the time grabbing a beer from the fridge.

&gt; and a bunch of additional nonsense

It's an interface designed by a designer and implemented in Qt. Refresh your memory with [this album of screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ERheR) and then tell me which part was ""additional nonsense""? None of it was wired up, and tabs like the ""Mining"" tab had no content and were just added to the menu by the designer.

&gt; Just admit your team is incompetent at certain things!

The Core Team are stewards, nothing more and nothing less. We can guide and direct, but that's where our role ends. Our individual contributions are our own efforts as individuals. You cannot leverage criticism against every contributor without knowing every contributor's circumstances.

&gt; People might actually WANT to help with some things or see that there is a real need.

People already are contributing. Look at the list of Monero code contributors: https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/graphs/contributors - notice that of the top 6 contributors by commits only 1 is a member of the core team? That means the rest are *contributors*.

Same goes for the Monero website, 18 pull requests by contributors merged since the site's inception: https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed. Contributing requires only a very small learning curve (to learn Kramdown and GitHub's very simple fork-and-edit interface). Not a single one of those PRs were from people that ""asked permission"" or waited for us to ""admit we're incompetent"" or some such nonsense. They just went ahead and looked at the website, saw something needed working on, and they went ahead and did it.

&gt; Nobody wants to get stonewalled with a boilerplate response about them contributing to the code base when that suggests having 10 years of experience with cryptography and programming expertise.

By that statement you are completely deriding and ignoring the massive amount of effort put in by everyone from the xmr.to team to the moneroblocks.eu team, plus the following Monero projects that are not direct contributions to Monero Core code (and require neither 10 years of experience with cryptography, and sometimes don't even require much programming expertise) -

https://github.com/MalMen/PHP-Monero  
https://github.com/tippero/python-monero  
https://github.com/tippero/tippero  
https://github.com/roosmaa/go-monero  
https://github.com/netmonk/moneronjs

https://github.com/openalias/openalias-api  
https://github.com/Jojatekok/MoneroGui.Net  
https://github.com/jwinterm/lightWallet

Again - none of those projects asked for permission or waited for some mystical admission of incompetence.

&gt; You'll probably hear more of this as our criticisms get more articulate

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has been met with the same criticisms. If you don't like the way we do things feel free to fork Monero and offer an alternative. If we are no longer in positions of stewardship because everyone starts using your fork then I can assure you that we will gladly hand over the domains, github account, etc., and you can run with it.

There are several features that Bitcoin will never be able to copy mainly the ones involving the mining algorithm, the block emission and the total number of coins. Monero is inherently inflationary, contrary to Bitcoin, this is more than enough reason for me to prefer Monero and is the reason many more people will never join Bitcoin (with or without sidechains) this feature not only is fair to the future generations because it allows wealth regeneration in large periods of time (100+ years) but it will protect the network without the need of transactions fees, this is just an example of something Bitcoin can never offer.

None of the projects you mentioned, including sidechains are enough to draw any reaction from me away from Monero, Bitcoin feels corrupted both as community (scams, dramas, etc) as an open-source project (can't scale, fungibility problems, etc). None of this is against any of the current BTC developers from whom personally I have sincere admiration, specially petertodd and gmaxwell. They, like the current Monero devs, inherited an uncertain project from unknown figures that may forever remain elusive.

Come back to say to us stop being excited with a REAL electronic cash when and if Bitcoin magically forks into a cryptonote fork.

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two aspects to this. At the moment, when you create a new wallet it generates two keys: your ""spend"" key and your ""view"" key. Now because this is unfinished software, the ""view"" key is shown once on creation and never again (we're fixing that:)

The view key (public key) is attached to transactions and would allow someone to view transactions you have made. The tooling will exist soon that will allow you to publish your public key and will allow someone else to use it on monerochain.info or other blockchain explorers and see all of your transactions and your balance. Moreover, we will add tooling that will allow you to publish the 1-time key *for a specific transaction*, thus allowing confirmation of the specifics of that transaction by an exchange or other party.

All of this is possible for any transactions that have already been made, so it's not like we have to make breaking changes to the code or hard-fork to support this, but we do need to add tooling so you can extract the relevant info from simplewallet (and other wallet tools) and then provide RPC calls and other information so the blockchain explorers can add tooling to view this information:)",,4,xmr,t1_ci1dhk1,t5_31hbr,moderator,False,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not so sure about that. The information on Wikileaks is public, but I remember some sort of commotion about US government workers being warned about looking at it for legal reasons.

Even if it's public, if you have it in your contacts or correspondence, it indicates a likely link of some sort. Probably not enough to arrest you, but possibly enough to target you with advertisements or investigate you.

&gt; Of course, Google could build a ""Monero address search"" that could just do the unpacking and build up a database, but then we're back to the comment above - the more public an address is the better:)

The strength with which the connection is made is different. If you have someone's email address, you have possibly spoken to them. If you have someone's Monero address, it's likely that you have paid them or at least considered doing so.

Truth is we are not trying to merely create a GUI, as in a GUI wrapper. Fact is these simple wrappers already exist (Neozaru, Jojatekok and jwinterm's and we could probably use Bitcoin wallet, like Pebblecoin does).

What we are trying to build is **scalable** GUI software. And *scalable* is the hard part, not *GUI*.

## What is scalable?

* Mnemonic seed for increased security ([why](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/isnt-mnemonic-seed-and-inability-change-words-security-holes)).
* Low RAM footprint (""the DB"", presently [Symas Lightning MDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) but later a lot others, since we built a database API).
* e-commerce prerequisites, notably for payment processors.
* Low bandwith footprint (a framework for SPV, like Electrum). The [remote node](http://xmrmonero.com/?q=faq/en/how-use-remote-node) provides a similar experience in that one doesn't have to download the whole blockchain, but this is where the similarities end and SPV would be lighter than a remote node.
- Much better understood (thus secure) and refactored code. This is behind-the-scene stuff and not sexy, but when it comes to securing your money, this matters. The Monero Protocol is sound, but we are not that comfortable with the source code we inherited in April (and improved since then). Note: we are pretty demanding on security, so when I say that ""we are not that comfortable"", this means the security is already high, just not high enough :)
- Gitian binaries
- Various mainstream users niceties, such as an address book, an easy way to do bookeeping (including easily report to tax offices, because Monero is not meant just for l33t haX0r, but for everyone, including legal persons like corporations, NGO, political parties...)
- Viewkey for optional transparency (see fluffy quote on Three Pilllars)
- Have a solid foundation for easy improvements later on (like third-parties improvements). Because once the (scalable) GUI wallet will be there, we expect things to accelerate - and we rather be ready for the acceleration. Fasten your seatbelt, Dorothy. 

## Why is scalable important?

Because it is one of the three pillars :)

More seriously, because once the official GUI wallet will be there, visibility will increase a lot. Which means more users who know nothing about Monero and later not even about cryptocurrencies. These people won't give a second thought. One does only one first impression. It *must* be the right one. Hence the necessity for a wallet than can handle the load. Be scalable, not that much on a technical standpoint than on a, say, ""political"" standpoint.

Thought I’d let you know about a few tools we developed for Altcoin Communities.

Firstly the comprehensive price index on the home page (bravenewcoin.com). 

Click on the arrow to the right of any coin to see a nice dropdown chart. 

Then check out Embeddable tickers page here http://bravenewcoin.com/tickers/

Just select whichever coin you want and copy/paste the code for that coin, displayed below, into your website design. 

We also have a coin profile page here http://bravenewcoin.com/coins/monero which acts like an info hub. 

We collect data from over 50 exchanges in over 23 trading pairs for over 65 coins. We have worked tirelessly for months securing out methodology, data processing and infrastructure. Our data is at a level where we can start supplying government or corporates with custom feeds. 

Our production schedule for August includes: Comprehensive Bitcoin Directory, zerohedge.com style community news section, Profiles for all Exchanges, profiles for hundreds of Crypto-Currency related companies.

Production Schedule for mid August to Dec includes: Comprehensive portfolio management tools and much needed Quickbooks, Fastbooks, MYOB &amp; Xero accounting software plugins. 

Lastly we have an Android App available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Techemy.BraveNewCoin 

The iOS version is coming in the next 2 weeks. An update is coming for Android in the next 2 weeks that includes being able to ‘favorite’ coins, having the coins summary on the home screen click-able to the data page and sorting of home screen by volume or other metrics. 

Check us out and any feedback is welcome

It isn't about the blockchain - you can always simply work off the top block in Bitcoin, Monero or anything else. Rather, it's about the utxoset, i.e. the set of unspent outputs.

In Bitcoin (and Darkcoin and etc.) a spend is always obvious and uniquely identifiable because of the signature. In Monero, you can never know if an output has been spent *precisely because it has true anonymity*. Therefore the set of possibly unspent outputs grows in time. The way around this is to use another data structure, e.g. a hash tree of that set and of the set of unspent key images. This has been discussed in our dev channel, but obviously Monero has more primitive infrastructure needs to sort out at this moment.

I can't comment on Darkcoin's 'untraceability' when it still has no code open sourced. Regardless, the masternode method itself will always be vulnerable to malicious nodes. I find it a bit funny that anyone thinks that imposing a token cost to obtaining a node is a serious barrier for capable institutions.

At a more base level, it doesn't actually do anything you couldn't do yourself in Bitcoin by sending to multiple mixers and hoping at least one isn't corrupt. This makes the whole endeavor questionable considering any real user would want to stick to Bitcoin for obvious reasons.

For instance, if a miner could purchase equipment upgrades in XMR, pay his electricity in XMR, and pay his rent in XMR, that's his costs covered. Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system.

That's like saying a game developer playing games day and night is a good thing because his goal is to give users a ""perfect gaming experience"". (I hope I understood you right here.)

&gt; It's even evidence of willingness to give up ""geek fame"" in favor of more important things.

That's like saying making people work for free is better than paying people. Should Google hire people to work for free and anonymously so that they're doing the work for the joy and purpose of it and not for ""geek fame"" or ""money""?

&gt; Can you substantiate that in any way, or is it just how you feel? Can you even explain what ""responsible"" means in that context?

Well all of us are fallible. Excluding ""perfect"" coders which might be all Monero has, Monero might have fallible coders. Possibly a **bit** ""lazy"" too. There's nothing wrong with that. It's human nature. Lazy people can do things right if under a bit of pressure, if there is a bit of reputation in question. That's how things work.

&gt; So what's the difference?

It's a subjective thing. I think anyone would feel attached to a project with his real name on, than with a project where he is anonymous.
If someone had said ""Real Name"" has done awesome work, you will feel a lot better than ""anonymousninjawhocankickandhowl"" has done awesome work. The former would drive someone to get back to the project than the latter.

And yes, no one is ""obliged"" to do anything, but isn't it more ""legit"" sounding when people come out openly and do stuff?

I started to follow more intensely when I picked up some Monero for myself, while I only have about 15 coins, I think I have more invested in XMR than any other coin because I feel there is going to be a future with this coin once people pick up on it.

Having some facility to generate additional addresses within a single wallet/account would make it a lot easier and more convenient to preserve unlinkability outside the blockchain.

There is another issue with using separate wallets/accounts. Unless you take care to forward any funds received in your single-use wallet/account to a global collection wallet/account, you end in a situation where all possible outputs you can use in future transactions come from a single or low number of transactions (this is bad, see MRL-004, section 3.2). This means that, if you wish to use Monero without reusing addresses, you have to spend additional transaction fees and have the hassle of resending funds to yourself.

Sure.. what shall I say? My perception is that ""2.0"" coins extend the basic function of blockchains to add in contracts and DAO capability. Gavin has also recently expressed an interest in incorporating some of these capabilities into bitcoin. Monero is an extension of bitcoin in that it provides full anonymity, but some would say part of bitcoins strength IS the public ledger. That doesn't diminish the benefit of Monero/Darkcoin, it simply establishes that they have separate goals.

&gt; Why do you feel this is important?

It's not really a personal opinion, it appears to be a community consensus. Blockchain 1.0 is a distributed ledger, Blockchain 2.0 is Smart Contracts incorporated into that ledger.

1) Put the blockchain.dat into the right place (the /AppData/Roaming/bitmonero folder) then run the .bat file to generate an address. Then you can either wait for the daemon to synchronize, or you can just quit the wallet and daemon with the command 'exit'. 

NOTE: It is important that you always close the daemon with the 'exit' command, otherwise it doesn't save any updates to the blockchain and you need to let it synchronise again.

2) **Write down the 24-word seed that you're given.** Keep it somewhere safe (not online because if someone gets this they can empty out your wallet). This is what you need to restore your wallet if your PC ever breaks or anything. You don't need your password to restore a wallet from seed, which is good if you forget your password but bad if someone else gets your seed.

3) Copy the wallet.bin, wallet.bin.keys, wallet.bin.address.txt to the simpleminer folder. Rename them to get rid of the .bin so you have the following files: wallet, wallet.keys and wallet.address.txt. You can also back up the wallet.bin.keys file, as you can use that to restore your Monero wallet (as long as you remember the password for it).

4) You can now launch simpleminer, put in your pool address and start mining. It should display the address you generated in step 1). Note that some antivirus software will flag the minerd.exe file in simpleminer as a virus because nefarious botnet owners have been using it to mine on other peoples computers, but it is actually totally safe.

5) To check your wallet balance, run the .bat from step 1), input your password into your wallet, and (once the daemon has synchronised and you are getting green text in that window), type 'refresh' into your wallet. This will scan through the blockchain and show you your balance.


I won't lie - Monero in it's current state is not the most user friendly of coins! But some big developments (including an easy-to-use GUI) are just around the corner which should make things a lot more straightforward than this.

I'm not so sure about that. The information on Wikileaks is public, but I remember some sort of commotion about US government workers being warned about looking at it for legal reasons.

Even if it's public, if you have it in your contacts or correspondence, it indicates a likely link of some sort. Probably not enough to arrest you, but possibly enough to target you with advertisements or investigate you.

For instance, if a miner could purchase equipment upgrades in XMR, pay his electricity in XMR, and pay his rent in XMR, that's his costs covered. Similarly, if the electricity company paid its staff in XMR and so on, then we have less and less exiting the system. With fiat and BTC settlement bridges (ie. that have eventual settlement, not instant settlement) this can happen without the parties even knowing or caring what happens, and it can happen without affecting the price much - or at all.

Ultimately the aim is to create something useful and usable that is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. That is not to dissuade speculators entirely, but they will have to get in at the sub-$50 mark if they want to see speculative growth. That said, I'm not sure the sharp rises and crashes have been good for Bitcoin, and I'd much prefer Monero to reach some realistic level (say $100) and hover around there.

I think 1-5 have been answered thoroughly, so I'll leave them be. I'd like to add something to number 6; a cryptonote sidechain. 

That being said, I firmly believe that, at this moment, Monero is by far the best long term speculative (alt)bet in crypto. Extremely speculative, yes, but best risk/reward. Because of: 

* excellent technical properties
* proven and highly relevant marketniche
* great devteam - smartest guys on the block
* wealthy and generous community, both intellectually and in btc	

  
My cryptfolio almost entirely consists of bitcoin/monero, currently around a 50/50 split. I keep gradually but steadily increasing my xmr-holdings.

Make sure to take all the time you need in order to make an informed decision. There's no need to rush if you eventually decide to buy some. Emission is still around [10.5 xmr/min so roughly 15k a day](http://chainradar.com/xmr/chart). With monero still being off-radar to a lot of bitcoiners this is high enough to supress any exuberance eventually.

We have and will keep experiencing highs but overall you can accumulate fairly easily and steadily. It is one of the more liquid altcoins, as you have probably seen.

When he started ignoring the community's overwhelming desire not to make Monero a merge-mined coin we (the Core Team, current stewards of the project) forked it and sort of came together. The core team did not know each other really, and the takeover wasn't planned. Some of us peripherally knew other members of the core team, so our binding factor was ""right place, right time"" plus each of us not being completely, utterly retarded. Of the 7 core team members 2 are not anonymous (myself and David) and the other 5 use pseudonyms (and practice their own opsec to a greater or lesser degree of their choosing). More details here: http://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/people
2. I think the viewkey functionality solves that problem entirely. Oppressive governments can demand their citizens hand over their viewkeys, more permissive governments can ask that they volunteer them for tax / regulation purposes. Neither of those governments can know if you have a private account or accounts (the privacy-leaking edge cases is what we're tightening up right now through things like i2p integration) so it really is ""private by default, optionally transparent"".
3. We have infinite supply (the block reward reduces to a minimum of 0.3 XMR in ~8 years and then stays at that value indefinitely) so late comers won't feel left out - it's a slightly inflationary cryptocurrency, not deflationary.
4. I think for something like Monero technical excellence will outstrip the competition. Anyone who knows about decentralised security software design and cryptography, and wants to get involved and contribute, would gravitate towards contributing to Monero rather than launch a competitor. Additionally, we're already diverging away from CryptoNote and will continue to do so quite dramatically (to fix their shortcomings and introduce new functionality), so a competitor would have to be forked from us.
5. Darknote is an outlier, I can't tell if they're part of the Bytecoin / CryptoNote scam, but they're certainly an interesting proposition if you want a currency that implements the CN protocol and won't veer away.
6. Lack of funding coupled with impatience from a userbase whose only reference points are the (relatively) mature Bitcoin and a bunch of premined / ICO-funded ~~scams~~ altcoins; heretofore unknown issues in the Ed25519 curve or some core cryptography that we can't replace fast enough; general and overwhelming apathy towards privacy, where people are content with sacrificing all privacy as long as they get ""free"" stuff.",,13,xmr,t1_cr6jmel,t5_31hbr,moderator,1431467431,,,,,,,,,,,

We are receiving paltry donations, despite everyone's best efforts. The amount of effort we are able to put in is directly proportional to the funding available to us.

&gt;there is a forum thread that breaks down the useful information revealed in each missive, and reveals the lack of useful information.

That would be the ""Monero is a scam"" thread, where their chief complaint is that we're not enhancing the ""protocol"". This is a truly ridiculous complaint, as protocol-level changes require a very, very deep understanding of the protocol, and careful forethought as it is people's money we are playing with. In the meantime, code auditing, code documentation, and code refactoring all needs to be done just so that we are actually in a position to implement any protocol-level changes. The very reason we have formed the Monero Research Lab is so that we can begin to implement protocol-level changes *slowly, over time*. Thus, the BCN shill in that thread claimed the following:

Jun 2nd - nothing special  
Jun 10th - determenistic wallet is a nice usability improvement to add but it has nothing to do with the protocol  
Jun 18th - nothing special  
Jun 27th - transaction splitting is somewhat close to the hardcore work  
July 6th — nothing at all  
July 20th — nothing special  
July 23rd — nothing special  
August 3rd — nothing special  
August 10th — nothing special  
August 16th — nothing special  

&gt; I want to see missives that disprove that

The reality is (and these are just the *major* code changes and nothing else):

**Jun 2nd** - first (and only) open source pool mining software for CryptoNote released; block reward penalty fix to prevent penalty attack  
**Jun 10th** - deterministic wallets based on a mnemonic seed; Doxygen docs begun; major RPC changes: payment_id in transfer RPC call, incoming_transfers RPC call  
**Jun 18th** - changes to allow for building on Arch; transaction auto-splitting  
**Jun 27th** - AES-NI support in the hashing function for faster verification; auto-split RPC call added in addition to CLI call; rpcwallet split out on development branch; daemonize forking effort begun  
**July 6th** - daemonize ready for initial testing; rpcwallet ready for initial testing; tx auto-splitting payment_ID added to transfer_split RPC call  
**July 13th** - blockchain class refactor begun; daemonize functionality in rpcwallet begun  
**July 20th** - daemonize now forking on *nix and using services on Windows; get_connections daemon RPC call; get_bulk_payments wallet RPC call added; initial QoS bandwidth control commits  
**July 23rd** - get_info daemon RPC call added; get_bulk_payments complete, Poloniex deposit processing down from 45 minutes to 17 seconds; daemonize/rpcwallet merged into common branch for testing  
**August 3rd** - blockchain class rewrite+refactor nearly complete; Windows move from MSVC to mingw/msys2 begun; refresh now takes an optional blockheight from parameter; seed / viewkey commands and query_key RPC call added to allow seed / key retrieval; DNS seeder code released  
**August 10th** - abstracted blockchain class is now in BlockchainDB; target-specific builds in CMake; OT logging system reimplementation in Monero begun (logging channels, rollover, etc.)  
**August 16th** - development branch added to github; mingw-w64 / msys2 build operational and ready for testing; wallet code refactor begun; BlockchainDB functionally complete and ready for implementation; GUI interface binaries released  
**August 24th to September 7th** - spam attack patch; block 202612 attack patch; block 202612 attack mitigation and fork fix (via a whole new block blob hash checkpointing system)  
**September 15th** - FreeBSD compatability; CMake miniupnpc overhaul to use system miniupnpc if available; static release Makefile target; versioning CMake overhaul to suit and indicate tagged releases; on-demand testnet released and operational; per-kb fees nearly ready for testing; default logging moved; LMDB database implementation begun  

&gt; GUI? yes, progress.

As we said in the Missive: ""*We have slowed down development on the GUI* to give us a bit more time to focus on the Monero internals"". Also, the GUI design work is not done by people who have the ability to work on Monero internals, so their work on it does not prevent anything else from moving along.

&gt; Blockchain size concerns *crickets*

It says right in the Missive: ""Blockchain: this took a bit of a backseat with the blockchain attacks. *Now that things are back to some semblance of normality, the first implementation can be written*. We have chosen LMDB for the initial implementation, as this will allow us to rapidly write a Berkeley DB interface based off of it (they use similar APIs) and thus have a baseline for performance comparisons.""

&gt; ""True privacy"" - that's cute. It certainly has better obfuscation, but obfuscation is not perfect privacy - it simply makes it much more difficult to de-obfuscate.
   
Let me rephrase: the best anonymity that can be found in the cryptocoins world! I personally disagree with the word ""obfuscation"". Obfuscation means something like coinjoin to me. With ring signatures, it's just maths that make it foundamentally intracable, not just a big noise to obfuscate the signal. There is mathematically no way to know which of the N inputs is the actual sender, at the single transaction level.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt;  One of very few coins to compliment bitcoin rather than compete.   

&gt; What does this even mean?   
   
""compliment"" is meant to be ""complement"". Didn't catch this, not a native speaker sorry.   
That means most altcoins claim to be better than bitcoin. The hype
around them is all about this, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not.
Take the most valued one by far, litecoin: it is all about ""having
faster block confirmation"", and ""resistant to asic"" (later rephrased
in better CPU/GPU/ASIC ratio, when the original statement was not true
anymore). The claim is just to do better than bitcoin, nothing
less. Which is ridiculous, with such negligeable changes nobody's
going to overcome bitcoin network effect and this is crystal clear
since years.  The cryptonote tech is not something better than
bitcoin, it is just *completely* different. Use bitcoin if you want
full transparency, use a cryptonote coin if you want full privacy.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Impossible to examine block chain for tracking funds.

&gt; There is a big difference between ""extremely difficult"" and ""impossible""

I'm not going to arg on that, you're right in theory. Let me rephrase
it so it is not ambiguous: cryptonote coins are by *very* far the most
difficult to track. I say *very*, because it happens at the math
level, not by just mixing as it was done previously (cf DRK). ""by far""
measures a conceptual gap here.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious candidate for crypto version of ""Swiss account""

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious contender for crypto with cash equivalence for privacy.

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right again!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Devs focusing on foundations not bling.

&gt; What does this mean?

They focus on fundamental things rather than bling-bling that would
make the coin looks more shiny in the eyes of the masses on short-term. Sounds
pretty rational, but it's not what is done by altcoin devs 99% of
the time. 

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Major interest from BTC ""hero"" members and BTC whales.

&gt; Sure, because they are looking to diversify their holdings. Don't
put all your eggs in one basket.

Well yes, but you evade the point here. The point is this: why on
Monero and not another alt? For many of them this is the first alt in
which they invest with a long-term perspective, or even the first in
which they invest at all.  The volume on exchanges is consistantly
puzzling for such a completely new coin based on a little known tech.
For many btc early adopters, they say it publicly, there is only one precedent to
the potential of Monero: that of bitcoin itself.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Cpu/gpu friendly. / Robust asic resistance.

&gt; On supposed ""ASIC resistance"" as a feature: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf

Fair point.

&amp;nbsp;   


&gt;&gt; Current state inflationary but coin holds value.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising difficulty.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising hash rate.  
&gt;&gt; Relatively equitable distribution.  
&gt;&gt; Low hype.  
&gt;&gt; High signal to noise community here.  
&gt;&gt; No evidence of any pump/dump.  

&gt; Fluff, and subject to change due to any number of variables.

I disagree, this is not all fluff. Having a low-hype/smart/long-term
oriented community is *very* healthy. Of course it is subject to
change, nobody can talk for the future, but sooooo many new coins
already fail here.   
I really do mean ""healthy"". Consider that it boils down to
having people really trusting and betting on this on a long-term perspective. 
These people will actually *build* stuff, rather than just
trading the high and low before switching to another coin.   
Again, many see only one precedent to this: bitcoin.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Future fundamental plusses:  
&gt;&gt; Gui imminent.  
&gt;&gt; Database overhaul underway.  
&gt;&gt; Website overhaul underway.  
&gt;&gt; Possible mobile client.  
&gt;&gt; Rpc wallet incoming.

Bitcoiner since 2011 here; I've never liked any altcoin as much as Monero.

The world has yet to discover the power of CyptoNote's disruptive innovations.

But we are all eager for open-source anon technology.

Coins like Dark, XC, Black, and Cloak have nothing under the hood but hype, hope, and vaporous promises to accomplish what Monero already has done.  There is much work ahead, but our course is clear.

Monero is best positioned to win the anon wars and share Bitcoin's throne, as the sexy new Queen for the now-mature King.

Monero benefits from Bytecoin's two years of experience and is committed to an open-source approach, which is absolutely crucial for surviving ruthless zero trust environments.

Much work is being done behind the scenes; great milestones will soon be passed.  Look forward to modular, scalable RocksDB and i2p integration.

Sure.. what shall I say? My perception is that ""2.0"" coins extend the basic function of blockchains to add in contracts and DAO capability. Gavin has also recently expressed an interest in incorporating some of these capabilities into bitcoin. Monero is an extension of bitcoin in that it provides full anonymity, but some would say part of bitcoins strength IS the public ledger. That doesn't diminish the benefit of Monero/Darkcoin, it simply establishes that they have separate goals.

&gt; Why do you feel this is important?

It's not really a personal opinion, it appears to be a community consensus. Blockchain 1.0 is a distributed ledger, Blockchain 2.0 is Smart Contracts incorporated into that ledger.

I will try to use our time productively by sharing some educational information that could hopefully trump this boring elevator music:

Governments are printing paper money like confetti and in the process they are diluting our purchasing power of our savings with inflation.  In the process the bankers are getting richer and governments are misappropriating taxpayer money whilst the poor have to bear the financial tax burden of bailouts of the financial system for the horrible behaviour of the corruptible politicians.  Everyone can associate with the induced business cycles by the Federal Reserve System.  I am sure you are most familiar with what happened in 2008 during the world-wide recession, Cyprus bank bail ins and numerous other examples.

With the invention of Bitcoin the power of money creation is systematically eroded from governments.   The cryptographically protected decentralised ledger of Bitcoin is a revolutionary breakthrough because it converts money into an incorruptible protocol, the use of which is totally voluntary in contrast with the fiat money that is issued by governments that’s  use is violently being enforced via legal tender laws and gangs with guns i.e. police and military.

Bitcoin is undeniably a great achievement in generating a worldwide decentralised consensus ledger in a frictionless way, which forms a very sounds basis for a monetary platform.  However, the traceability of transactions through the Bitcoin ledger undermines financial privacy that in the current digital age of Orwellian government surveillance is undermining human liberty.  Financial privacy is as much a human right as any other and needs protection, hence the invention of Monero.

Monero’s cryptographic protocol achieves what Bitcoin was intended to but couldn’t because of fundamental cryptographic limitations.  In the long run the anonymous Monero protocol could mean more for financial freedom and liberty than Bitcoin.  Whilst Bitcoin could end the reliance on a parasitic Federal Reserve System, Monero could also end government and third party spying on your everyday financial transactions.

So, my hope is that you would feel intrigued and inquisitive in Googling the revolution that is Monero for yourself.  See you on the online forums.  Google will lead you there.

Have a great day and I hope this elevator trip will be most memorable.

Up until the block 202612 attack the C code was ""fine for the moment"". Then there was a real attack that used an exploit that would've been caught in a refactor.

So the priorities shift, because what good is a GUI without a blockchain DB? And what good is a blockchain DB without multi-threaded verification? And what good is multi-threaded verification if an exploit exists in the low-level C code that needs to be refactored?

Just when we start in earnest down that road we have someone coming along claiming to have a ""coin killer"" exploit that [""under the right conditions will allow an attacker to steal your wallets and hijack your addresses""](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=786201.0). So priorities shift again, for what good is fixing exploits that exist in the low-level C code if our user's funds can be stolen?

And now, after wasting time re-analysing all of that we're working our way back up the chain of ""stuff that is both urgent and important""...but I can guarantee that something else will come along that will force us to re-evaluate priorities.

Also, we never said we are underfunded *right now*, we said that funding would be an issue in future. We (the core team) are spending our own funds, and we're fine with that, because having more funds *will not* equate to us being able to do anything faster. The reason is simple: there are precious few people on the planet that can quickly grok the deeper cryptographic issues in play, so when something makes us re-evaluate priorities ALL the members of the core team and all the contributors focus inwardly. Those that can't grok the deeper cryptographic issues also can't do anything else, because nobody is available to provide guidance and assistance with any of their efforts.

So, we need to ask ourselves: how do we create a resilient crypto protocol that fundamentally resists humans trying to tamper with it through social means?

Having some facility to generate additional addresses within a single wallet/account would make it a lot easier and more convenient to preserve unlinkability outside the blockchain.

There is another issue with using separate wallets/accounts. Unless you take care to forward any funds received in your single-use wallet/account to a global collection wallet/account, you end in a situation where all possible outputs you can use in future transactions come from a single or low number of transactions (this is bad, see MRL-004, section 3.2).

100% - my brain typed ""The way Boost serialisation is used"" and my fingers typed ""Endianness"". Plz disregard.

&gt; Also, I do not see that OS X / FreeBSD / Linux share the same - they have different checksum.

That's an artefact of simultaneous downloads, I would imagine, I can assure you they're the same file as they're just symlink'd through:

Let me rephrase: the best anonymity that can be found in the cryptocoins world! I personally disagree with the word ""obfuscation"". Obfuscation means something like coinjoin to me. With ring signatures, it's just maths that make it foundamentally intracable, not just a big noise to obfuscate the signal.

&gt;&gt;  One of very few coins to compliment bitcoin rather than compete.   

&gt; What does this even mean?   
   
""compliment"" is meant to be ""complement"". Didn't catch this, not a native speaker sorry.   
That means most altcoins claim to be better than bitcoin. The hype
around them is all about this, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not.
Take the most valued one by far, litecoin: it is all about ""having
faster block confirmation"", and ""resistant to asic"" (later rephrased
in better CPU/GPU/ASIC ratio, when the original statement was not true
anymore). The claim is just to do better than bitcoin, nothing
less. Which is ridiculous, with such negligeable changes nobody's
going to overcome bitcoin network effect and this is crystal clear
since years.  The cryptonote tech is not something better than
bitcoin, it is just *completely* different. Use bitcoin if you want
full transparency, use a cryptonote coin if you want full privacy.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Impossible to examine block chain for tracking funds.

&gt; There is a big difference between ""extremely difficult"" and ""impossible""

I'm not going to arg on that, you're right in theory. Let me rephrase
it so it is not ambiguous: cryptonote coins are by *very* far the most
difficult to track. I say *very*, because it happens at the math
level, not by just mixing as it was done previously (cf DRK). ""by far""
measures a conceptual gap here.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious candidate for crypto version of ""Swiss account""

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious contender for crypto with cash equivalence for privacy.

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right again!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Devs focusing on foundations not bling.

&gt; What does this mean?

They focus on fundamental things rather than bling-bling that would
make the coin looks more shiny in the eyes of the masses on short-term. Sounds
pretty rational, but it's not what is done by altcoin devs 99% of
the time. 

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Major interest from BTC ""hero"" members and BTC whales.

&gt; Sure, because they are looking to diversify their holdings. Don't
put all your eggs in one basket.

Well yes, but you evade the point here. The point is this: why on
Monero and not another alt? For many of them this is the first alt in
which they invest with a long-term perspective, or even the first in
which they invest at all.  The volume on exchanges is consistantly
puzzling for such a completely new coin based on a little known tech.
For many btc early adopters, they say it publicly, there is only one precedent to
the potential of Monero: that of bitcoin itself.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Cpu/gpu friendly. / Robust asic resistance.

&gt; On supposed ""ASIC resistance"" as a feature: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf

Fair point.

&amp;nbsp;   


&gt;&gt; Current state inflationary but coin holds value.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising difficulty.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising hash rate.  
&gt;&gt; Relatively equitable distribution.  
&gt;&gt; Low hype.  
&gt;&gt; High signal to noise community here.  
&gt;&gt; No evidence of any pump/dump.  

&gt; Fluff, and subject to change due to any number of variables.

I disagree, this is not all fluff. Having a low-hype/smart/long-term
oriented community is *very* healthy. Of course it is subject to
change, nobody can talk for the future, but sooooo many new coins
already fail here.   
I really do mean ""healthy"". Consider that it boils down to
having people really trusting and betting on this on a long-term perspective. 
These people will actually *build* stuff, rather than just
trading the high and low before switching to another coin.   
Again, many see only one precedent to this: bitcoin.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Future fundamental plusses:  
&gt;&gt; Gui imminent.  
&gt;&gt; Database overhaul underway.  
&gt;&gt; Website overhaul underway.  
&gt;&gt; Possible mobile client.  
&gt;&gt; Rpc wallet incoming.  

&gt; More fluff; worthless until these things actually exist.

Worthless to you, but worth mentioning to newcomers :)

Anybody, anonymous or not, can ditch any project, and especially a project like Monero, with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever. At most you might want to explain your reasons. Being a contributor to an open source project is not normally considered to indenture you to that project.

This is a massive mindfuck to bitcoiners and the general public because you just basically said your coin is equal to bitcoin in terms of value, and because you are playing fair, you are inviting them aboard and giving them prior notice.  
  
On the other hand, yeah, starting a new ledger sucks, but with all due respect to Satoshi, a ledger began in 2014 (when many more know about crypto) that opens up mining to everyone vs. Becoming an ASIC race *is* fairer.

&gt; ""True privacy"" - that's cute. It certainly has better obfuscation, but obfuscation is not perfect privacy - it simply makes it much more difficult to de-obfuscate.
   
Let me rephrase: the best anonymity that can be found in the cryptocoins world! I personally disagree with the word ""obfuscation"". Obfuscation means something like coinjoin to me. With ring signatures, it's just maths that make it foundamentally intracable, not just a big noise to obfuscate the signal. There is mathematically no way to know which of the N inputs is the actual sender, at the single transaction level.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt;  One of very few coins to compliment bitcoin rather than compete.   

&gt; What does this even mean?   
   
""compliment"" is meant to be ""complement"". Didn't catch this, not a native speaker sorry.   
That means most altcoins claim to be better than bitcoin. The hype
around them is all about this, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not.
Take the most valued one by far, litecoin: it is all about ""having
faster block confirmation"", and ""resistant to asic"" (later rephrased
in better CPU/GPU/ASIC ratio, when the original statement was not true
anymore). The claim is just to do better than bitcoin, nothing
less. Which is ridiculous, with such negligeable changes nobody's
going to overcome bitcoin network effect and this is crystal clear
since years.  The cryptonote tech is not something better than
bitcoin, it is just *completely* different. Use bitcoin if you want
full transparency, use a cryptonote coin if you want full privacy.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Impossible to examine block chain for tracking funds.

&gt; There is a big difference between ""extremely difficult"" and ""impossible""

I'm not going to arg on that, you're right in theory. Let me rephrase
it so it is not ambiguous: cryptonote coins are by *very* far the most
difficult to track. I say *very*, because it happens at the math
level, not by just mixing as it was done previously (cf DRK). ""by far""
measures a conceptual gap here.

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious candidate for crypto version of ""Swiss account""

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Serious contender for crypto with cash equivalence for privacy.

&gt; This is just rehashing the prior claim.

You're right again!

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Devs focusing on foundations not bling.

&gt; What does this mean?

They focus on fundamental things rather than bling-bling that would
make the coin looks more shiny in the eyes of the masses on short-term. Sounds
pretty rational, but it's not what is done by altcoin devs 99% of
the time. 

&amp;nbsp;   

&gt;&gt; Major interest from BTC ""hero"" members and BTC whales.

&gt; Sure, because they are looking to diversify their holdings. Don't
put all your eggs in one basket.

Well yes, but you evade the point here. The point is this: why on
Monero and not another alt? For many of them this is the first alt in
which they invest with a long-term perspective, or even the first in
which they invest at all.  The volume on exchanges is consistantly
puzzling for such a completely new coin based on a little known tech.
For many btc early adopters, they say it publicly, there is only one precedent to
the potential of Monero: that of bitcoin itself.

&gt;&gt; Cpu/gpu friendly. / Robust asic resistance.

&gt; On supposed ""ASIC resistance"" as a feature: https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf

&gt;&gt; Current state inflationary but coin holds value.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising difficulty.  
&gt;&gt; Smoothly rising hash rate.  
&gt;&gt; Relatively equitable distribution.  
&gt;&gt; Low hype.  
&gt;&gt; High signal to noise community here.  
&gt;&gt; No evidence of any pump/dump.  

&gt; Fluff, and subject to change due to any number of variables.

I disagree, this is not all fluff. Having a low-hype/smart/long-term
oriented community is *very* healthy. Of course it is subject to
change, nobody can talk for the future, but sooooo many new coins
already fail here.   
I really do mean ""healthy"". Consider that it boils down to
having people really trusting and betting on this on a long-term perspective. 
These people will actually *build* stuff, rather than just
trading the high and low before switching to another coin.   
Again, many see only one precedent to this: bitcoin.

I'd like to address the comments that have been bouncing around, particularly the points AlexGr raised. I read some of the back-and-forth, and I'm glad we are debating and engaging like this.

As a brief history lesson, do you remember Tenebrix? It was the first scrypt-based coin. To quote [Buffer Overflow's thoughts on the matter](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=207047.msg2743841#msg2743841): ""The block reward at block 1 was 7769999.00000000 TBX, then continues with 25.00000000 TBX for each block after that."" Tenebrix was unabashedly premined, just as BCN has been. Litecoin cloned Tenebrix (Artforz was even the main developer contributing code to both Tenebrix and Litecoin), added a few small changes and bug fixes, and there you have it. Nobody really remembers Tenebrix or even Fairbrix (fair relaunch of Tenebrix by Coblee, who launched Litecoin at roughly the same time - it died due to lack of any hashrate which made a 51% attack trivial), but Litecoin? Well. Need I say more.

I do not think any of us have any bug-bear with the BCN developers. But it is a fallacy to believe that they are wizards that wrote the code and therefore the only people capable of maintaining it, as was already demonstrated in the Tenebrix / Litecoin debacle. Litecoin certainly didn't need to wait for lolcust to make code changes for them to fix bugs and improve the codebase.


I also feel we should challenge BCN's claimed 2 years of blockchain data for several reasons:

- The blockchain was not publicly observable or observed for those 2 years. We have no reason to believe it is true, and even if it was true it still means that ~151 billion of the 184 billion BCN (82%) were mined prior to its public release. Think about that pragmatically. Would you want to use a currency where unknown actors controlled over 80% of it? This alone takes Bytecoin from being decentralised to being centralised by virtue of those controlling the flow of the currency.

- Thus far we have not had any outpouring of public, known figures stating that they have used BCN for the past few years and can back up the 2 year claim. This means that the 151 billion is in the hands of people unknown, unknowable, and untrustworthy. Not only can they perform massive market manipulation with that, but everyone is left dabbling in the shallow end of the pool. Practically: at the current block reward the BCN network will spit out ~82.5 million coins a day down to ~44.7 million at the end of the year. That means that between now and the end of the year (224 days) the network will produce around 13.83 billion coins in a supposedly fair manner, or about 7.6%, barely enough to swing a cat much less affect the power wielded by those controlling 82% of the supply. By comparison, Monero has had 846 707 coins mined to date, of a total of ~18.4 million coins, or 4.6%, which leaves the market wide open for all to participate.

- The CryptoNote whitepaper [was published on October 17, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sMExnQ9.png), and the [first commit to the Github repo was on November 15, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/xYEB5fr.png). By means of a comparison: Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in November 2008, and the network started in January 2009 with the first client, a not-too-disimilar timeframe. Had the BCN network started in November nobody would be questioning it. Rather, it stands to reason, by all accounts, that the individual(s) behind the CryptoNote whitepaper either wrote the initial code and gave it to the Bytecoin developer(s) who then ran with this, falsified a blockchain (trivial), and released it publicly in March after blockchain falsification was complete.

- The BCN mining code shipped purposely crippled, presumably as a way of making the falsified blockchain seem legitimate. Not just weird or written by a cryptographer who doesn't know how to optimise, but purposely crippled for slow mining. Things like recalculating a static value in every iteration of a loop instead of just once at the beginning is not a mistake, especially when viewed in light of the claimed 2 year history. Did nobody care to optimise the hashing code in 2 years, not even to improve the amount of time it takes to download and verify a blockchain from scratch? I find that unlikely. On the other hand: if you [glance at our Github commits](https://github.com/monero-project/bitmonero/commits/master) you'll notice that in two iterations (26c1a8569c and 49d55d3c30, primarily) we first improved the hashing by 2x its initial performance, and then further improved it to 12x its initial performance. It appears that the BCN devs are so lazy they haven't even merged our changes in, so everyone mining on their network has either used our changes or is mining 12x slower than they could. Or they just have a significantly faster miner already and couldn't be bothered.

- On their website, wherein they claim 2 years of stable work, they say: ""Launched back in July 2012, Bytecoin has proved that it is going to stay for years to come."" If that was the case, how did they not notice critical issues in the RPC API? The documentation on their wiki is blatantly incorrect (adding a trailing slash to the JSON RPC API URL causes a 404), and running simplewallet in RPC API mode tends to silently lose its connection to the daemon every few hours. That's a surprising issue not to have picked up in 2 years - was nobody using the RPC API in the wallet? None of the BCN merchants accepting payments needed to track said payments automatically? This seems highly improbable.


Monero is not merely a fair relaunch of an existing cryptocurrency. It is unashamedly a fair relaunch of Bytecoin, but the changes and bugfixes and improvements made in under a month speak volumes for the commitment we have to improving Monero. The Bytecoin developers have already shown their reluctance to merge our changes, why would they bother inheriting any further improvements we will make? If you want to use and mine Bytecoin with their crippled miner and their 82% premine please be my guest. I have nothing against the Bytecoin developers or their coin, and wish them all the best. As for me, and the rest of the Monero team, we will continue to take Monero to the next level without needing to wait for anyone's stamp of approval:)",,8,xmr,t1_chndp0f,t5_31hbr,,False,,,,,,,,,,,

We had a discussion early on about decentralised governance within Monero, and decided there was no ""good fit"" for any system just yet. The best we can do is take the voting / funding of enhancements away from our control (via the Forum Funding System), and add some other bits to make code and protocol governance more ""decentralised"" (more on that soon).

But we currently are, and will remain for the time being, the ""benevolent dictator for life"". This is a model that has served Linux well, and we believe it is best suited to making the hard decisions required in a cryptocurrency (and, more specifically, to make decisions as a core team that may not be popular with many people, such as when we decided *not* to change the emission curve).

If, in future, the community decides we're doing a bad job they will replace us. If, in future, we find a better decentralised governance system we will switch to that. None of this is set in stone, but it is ""for the foreseeable future"" or ""until something better comes along.

&gt; Right now the devs are in accord, and all is well. What if in seven years a major rift happens as a result of government intervention into the Monero project. How will we determine who has the 'right' to update the Monero client?

I spoke to this on the Monero forum, so here you go:

""Let's pretend we were facing the same situation as Bitcoin, with a polarised decision that has to be made. It's very unlikely that 1 of the 7 core team members could act like Gavin, because the division would be clear (not so with Bitcoin where there is this misconception that ""only Blockstream devs disagree with Gavin"" or ""everyone that matters agrees with Gavin"" when meanwhile, back at the ranch, he's the only one of the 5 core maintainers that wants the 20mb limit right now). But even so, let's imagine it's 3 vs 3 on the decision with 1 abstain, and the community is torn.

Now here's the clincher: *with planned hard forks we could very easily put the code in and then measure full node uptake over 6 months*. Since the code only kicks in after the 6 month window *and* the node observes a sufficient percentage of blocks on the new version, it simply wouldn't enable that code if there is not sufficient uptake. This could be modified to be both % of mined blocks + % of connected nodes for the sake of fairness. We therefore let the miners and users decide, and we can always nuke that code in the next hard fork update.""

&gt; Perhaps if you are going to create a social framework around Monero (and scheduled hard forks are definitely a social frame work) then a constitution needs to be drawn up as well.

There will be something like this drawn up, that is a discussion we'll open up soon.

&gt; And like it or not, after a certain point (four years sounds good) you are going to need to have a system in place for elections and appointments to the board of developers.

That's exactly what I was alluding to with the BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) thing - we probably won't increase it at all, unless we really have to, and then we'll handle that within the core team. It is very unlikely that there will be so many others who come along that understand decentralised security systems that they become integral and have to sit on the core team (plus not everyone wants to have that responsibility). That is not to say we won't be transparent, but I think that it is best to avoid too formalised a structure there. That having been said, there are peripheral organisations, such as MEW, that can have all sorts of formal structure and that have our ear. Similarly, we could create something akin to the LSB (Linux Standard Base) which provides even more formal control over implementations and interaction mechanisms.

&gt; I know that sounds dire, but what we are trying to do is take humans out of the equation, right? So we should be very cautious about rushing to put humans back into it, even if it's a necessary and rational move.

You're trying to take humans out at the wrong layer.

Open source projects absolutely need guidance and decision making. With something like Monero it's even more important that there's a centralised structure to meet the paradigm that journalists and companies inevitably expect. Having this centralised ""benevolent dictator"" structure is completely fine, as long as we aren't precluding others from making a meaningful contribution (more on that soon).

Where the human element should be taken out is in the network consensus level. Right now Bitcoin is getting this wrong. If Bitcoin needs to hard fork they have to first convince everyone to upgrade. With the combination of the core team as benevolent dictators and the 6-month hard fork rollover we can instead push out a fork and then spend 6 months observing the uptake and acting accordingly.

Oh and before there are any thoughts given to us being in ""control"" there are two things that should be born in mind:

1. We are in control as stewards of the project. That's the nature of the situation, and it won't change. We deserve that control, partly because we are not complete morons and are doing a decent job, but also because we've sunk more time, money, and energy into Monero than anyone else.

2. We inherited that role from thankful_for_today, so we're VERY cognisant that we can be ousted from the community and a new group can take it over. This means that, whilst we are capable of making firm decisions, we are also able to step back and reverse decisions where they aren't met with broad community acceptance.

&gt; if 6-month hard forks become a thing, two competing groups in the future will both fight for their right to update the client

But in the end nodes and miners will decide. Two competing groups would actually make it easier - we could host both downloads on getmonero.org and then miners would be able to more easily select the one they want to vote for:)

Also let's not forget that this structure is not necessarily ""for life"". We will do this until it is no longer workable, and then we'll do something else. The 6 month rolling fork means that we can easily change the software, and changing the systems and core team is also not insurmountable.",,10,xmr,t1_crp8t9s,t5_31hbr,moderator,1432933724,,,,,,,,,,,
