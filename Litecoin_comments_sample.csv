The technical advantage of a diversity of cryptocurrency systems isn't theoretical, it's proven, for instance *when Bitcoin forked recently Litecoin was fine*.

Surely there are other classes of failure/attack to which both systems are vulnerable, but *that* is what's still theoretical.  Litecoin has actually allowed cryptocurrency transactions to continue during a disruption of the Bitcoin network. 

Having a second set of currency markets is also a useful redundancy.  For instance Litecoin has recently been trading relatively steadily for $4-$5, even as that's gone from being ฿0.04 to being ฿0.02!

The immediate effect of mtgox support litecoins will be that the bitcoin value will go down as most people originally buying litecoins will simply exchange bitcoins for them. This will ofcourse change after the first few days assuming they allow for USD/LTC transactions.

There is a single most unintelligent assumption people make with these calculations for long-term estimates. They **don't use long-term estimates** at all.

If you really increase difficulty by 2928% per quarter, then also the price will increase to follow or lead difficulty, or both. Having bitcoin available, miners can switch back and forth to whichever is more profitable. They can also buy and sell the more profitable one, for the less profitable one, because they can see spot value and electricity costs instantly.



Your estimate should include this litecoin valuation in USD:

Week 1: 4

Week 2: 5.2

Week 3: 6.8

Week 4: 8.8

Week 5: 11.4

Week 6: 14.9

**Result: Buy all the mining hardware today!**


note 1: Hardware can be sold out with limited losses in case of litecoin crash. Litecoin can be sold out with complete losses in case of litecoin crash.


note 2: check the production parity between week 1 and week 13 as a quick method to speed calculations, week 1 gives 36*4.75 USD, week 13 would give the same value in 1 LTC, thus one LTC should be 171 USD to offer the same mining profitability.

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

I find that the thread concurrency needs to be EXACT for optimum performance. If you are also using a 7870 then my thread concurrency values are likely to work for you. Like literally, to the last digit. I started with reaper but moved to cgminer with the [guiminer interface](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150331.0). Here's what i got:

For when i'm at the computer and want to interact, I get 300kh with this cgminer configuration: clock at **1150**, mem clock at **1350**, thread concurrency at **8192**, intensity **12**

I played around and found that If I increase the clock and mem clock up to 1200/1400 i get even better performance, but more prone to a gpu driver crash. Perhaps you can clock up even more. (1230/1430 got me 320kh before crashing)


Now for over night mining at 400kh I use a different config. clock at **950**, mem clock at **1450**, thread concurrency at **15232**, intensity **18**.
 I attempted this at 1000/1500 and got 420kh but the mem clock caused a crash at that level.
 

Another thing i learned is that stale/errors and pool errors can greatly reduce performance. A good pool i switched to is [http://give-me-ltc.com/](http://give-me-ltc.com/), and if you are using cgminer it has stratum support built in. Stratum makes a HUGE difference in efficient mining. All you need to do it put in the pool stratum address for the host.

Hope this helps my fellow 7870 miners! And if you have another card, find out the best thread concurrency to use... cause that is the one thing that can enhance or reduce performance, when paired with a proper clock to mem clock ratio.

In 15 minutes you can be fairly well assured your transaction is finalized in the network, compared to an hour for Bitcoin.  For ecommerce applications, this is a vital point.

Litecoin offers a directly integrated means of providing fast trust in arbitrary transactions by not aiming to make it possible for interstellar commerce to occur over the protocol (which would be the only real need for such a long block target).

You're also wrong that scrypt provides no protection from ASICs.  The author of the algorithm specifically created it as a means of protecting against ASIC attacks.

And you can't move Bitcoin ASICs to scrypt mining, so Litecoin won't hurt the mining rate of the Bitcoin network at all.  On the contrary, Litecoin will take advantage of all of the displaced GPUs which would have no reason to mine Bitcoin anyway and provide a means of allowing them to continue securing the network.  Litecoin will offer redundancy to the Bitcoin network when services integrate support for both.

Scrypt is actually a better basis algorithm (than Bitcoin's SHA256) and will make it more difficult to produce specialized FPGAs or ASICs.  This means that all of the GPU miners who find that Bitcoin is no longer profitable as difficulty rises from ASICs over the next few months will be looking to mine another cryptocoin.  Given that Litecoin is the most technically sound and widest used altcoin, it is the natural option.
It's actually good that they don't differ much otherwise.

I don't see any major flaws in either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and I think that Litecoin is using a better basis algorithm, is inheriting all of the good parts of Bitcoin, and is not messing anything up from it's parent.

I covered a bit about this in an earlier topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

In 15 minutes you can be fairly well assured your transaction is finalized in the network, compared to an hour for Bitcoin.  For ecommerce applications, this is a vital point.

Litecoin offers a directly integrated means of providing fast trust in arbitrary transactions by not aiming to make it possible for interstellar commerce to occur over the protocol (which would be the only real need for such a long block target).

You're also wrong that scrypt provides no protection from ASICs.  The author of the algorithm specifically created it as a means of protecting against ASIC attacks.

And you can't move Bitcoin ASICs to scrypt mining, so Litecoin won't hurt the mining rate of the Bitcoin network at all.  On the contrary, Litecoin will take advantage of all of the displaced GPUs which would have no reason to mine Bitcoin anyway and provide a means of allowing them to continue securing the network.  Litecoin will offer redundancy to the Bitcoin network when services integrate support for both.

Bitcoin's and Litecoin's improvements can work in tandem.  Again, other cryptocoins created before and after Litecoin have failed while Litecoin continues gathering momentum, so there's really little risk of arbitrary chains gaining hold and hurting the platform.  People have more sense than that.  Litecoin is surviving and thriving on its merits while other coins falter and die for their lack of them.

But i too feel the market for Litecoin, what you can do with it as of now, the exchange and wallet systems, really do need more time to amass support and real coherence and reselience. I think mathematically it makes sense for LTC to be 4x less than BTC due to the volume difference and mining difficulty difference. And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

The technical advantage of a diversity of cryptocurrency systems isn't theoretical, it's proven, for instance *when Bitcoin forked recently Litecoin was fine*.  People have since then obliviously kept repeating the argument that Litecoin isn't substantially different enough to matter, but that argument *must* fall against the fact that it *did* recently actually practically matter!!  Surely there are other classes of failure/attack to which both systems are vulnerable, but *that* is what's still theoretical.  Litecoin has actually allowed cryptocurrency transactions to continue during a disruption of the Bitcoin network. 

Having a second set of currency markets is also a useful redundancy.  For instance Litecoin has recently been trading relatively steadily for $4-$5, even as that's gone from being ฿0.04 to being ฿0.02!  The LTC price is happy to diverge from the BTC price, so it allows the cryptocurrency market as a whole to be more diverse and stable. 

There isn't necessarily any benefit to Litecoin *for you* and indeed that is another sort of useful diversity.  You may find that Litecoin doesn't interest you and that you don't spend much time paying attention to it or involved in the community around it, but meanwhile other people with other tastes will find that they *are* interested in it.

I have to admit, I love the faster block speeds and that is a huge selling point for litecoin.  Bitoin is also begining to have difficulty with the number of transactions that can fit in a block.  Litecoin already is better suited for this.  If most merchants are just using cryptocurrencies to covert to USD right away, what difference does it make to them?  Here is a video of a bar that does just that, and they probally use Mt. Gox's API's  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm6aM8mIQSs

I said this in another comment, but it applies here too:

*The connection between expected value and the total number of coins circulated is overstated. Litecoins should not be equal to 0.25 Bitcoins just because there will be four times more Bitcoins. The value of a coin is only really tied to how much faith people put in it in general. This applies to all currencies.*

*You could consider the total value of a currency as just the total faith and the value of a single coin is just ""FAITH / COIN-TOTAL."" My arguments are just that the fundamentals of Litecoin are now strong enough that we should expect faith in Litecoin to be approximately that of what faith in Bitcoin was three months ago.

Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

With all the new miners now (including new ones coming in that will start to research and find BTC is impregnable) there will be a lot of users with litecoins they want to spend. Here we will then start to see services (supply) start up to meet the new customers (demand). This in turn will start to rise the value of litecoin.

11,t1_c97rg7n,t3_1blg6y,0,,0,"News from the Mt.GOX IRC channel (from MT.GOX officials) is that MT.GOX will support LTC by the end of April.  Most people are unaware of the timeframe and there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether they even will support it (there are still many people who think it was an April Fool's joke).

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Knowing that, I don't think the news is ""priced in"" very much at all, and I expect LTC to rise significantly from wherever it is when LTC trading opens on MT.GOX before the end of the month.


Addressing your other points:

&gt; No idea how much of these LTCs are being hoarded by miners and are ready to flood the market with cheap supply. Maybe someone can give me more info as to this issue. I am new to crypto, but have traded currencies for years.

People on the Litecoin forums have been keeping track of the large wallets.  There's really only a couple dozen people with very large numbers of Litecoins.  Many of those have been bought in the last month it appears, so it doesn't seem like there are many peoeple who held onto big stacks from when they were easy to mine.

&gt; The amount of LTC to be in circulation vs BTC in circulation. Just seems like LTC/BTC should be trading lower based on this.

If coin counts were the only factor, LTC/BTC would be around 0.25, which is much higher than where it is hovering at around 0.04-0.05 recently, so I don't understand your argument there.",,1431685526,True,False,Normif,11,1365013781,litecoin,c97st7j,1365014226,t1_c97st7j,0,t5_2szgd,,

8,t3_1c1sqv,t3_1c1sqv,1,,0,"I recently built a linux-based mining rig with 3x 7950s in it. I documented the process and sent it to a couple friends with zero linux experience (I know you said you're comfortable with linux, but just in case a linux newbie is interested in giving this a shot...), and they were able to get up and running in a matter of hours with their own rigs. We're getting about 620 kH/sec on each GPU with modest overclocks, which is exactly the same hashrate that I see in win7.  
  
Here is exactly what I sent to them:  

#**1) Configure BIOS settings:**

   - disable everything we're not using (audio, serial port, firewire, etc)
   - change power options to automatically start system whenever power is restored (in case power goes out while you're away, also makes it easier to power on with no switch...)
   - make sure that USB flash stick is first in boot order


#**2) Install Xubuntu desktop x64 from temporary CD drive (or another USB stick) to your USB stick**

   - get the installation image here:  http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs-Xubuntu/12.10/release/xubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso
   - use 8GB+ USB stick, partition 5500mb for root (/), 315mb for swap, and the remaining amount for home (/home)
   - make sure to check auto-login box during install
   - boot into desktop when done

   
#**3) Install AMD Catalyst drivers:**

   (open terminal)


    sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates fglrx-updates-dev
    sudo aticonfig --lsa
    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial
    sudo reboot
   

   (after reboot, check that everything works:)
   

    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --odgt


   (you should see all of your cards with hardware monitoring enabled)

   *Important: you will likely need to have something plugged into each video card to prevent the OS from idling it. The easiest way to do this is to make a dummy plug for each card. Instructions: 
   http://www.overclock.net/t/384733/the-30-second-dummy-plug

   If you add/remove video cards later, re-run this:   sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial 


#**4) Install SSH, curl, &amp; update all packages**

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server byobu
   

   (the rest can be done via SSH if you wish - make sure to forward port 22 on your firewall to the box if you want to connect from outside your network)  
   (As for an SSH client, I recommend Putty - you can copy each of the remaining commands and then right-click them into your putty window instead of typing them manually)
      

    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade



#**5) Install CGMiner:**

    wget http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/cgminer/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2
    tar jxvf cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2


   (optional - delete the archive)

    rm *.bz2


   (optional - check if cgminer detects all GPUs properly:)

    cd cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    ./cgminer -n


#**6) Create cgminer startup script:**


    nano mine_litecoins.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/sh
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    cd /home/[your xubuntu username]/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built
    ./cgminer --scrypt -I 19 -g 1 -w 256 --thread-concurrency 21712 --auto-fan -o stratum+tcp://notroll.in:3333 -u [your notroll.in workername] -p 12345 --failover-only -o stratum+tcp://coinotron.com:3334 -u [your coinotron workername] -p 12345


   (save the file &amp; quit nano)


    chmod +x mine_litecoins.sh
   
   

#**7) Create auto-start scripts**


    nano miner_launcher.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/bash
    DEFAULT_DELAY=0
    if [ ""x$1"" = ""x"" -o ""x$1"" = ""xnone"" ]; then
       DELAY=$DEFAULT_DELAY
    else
       DELAY=$1
    fi
    sleep $DELAY
    su [your xubuntu username] -c ""screen -dmS cgm /home/[your xubuntu username]/mine_litecoins.sh""


   (save the file &amp; quit nano)


    chmod +x miner_launcher.sh
   

   
   Add this line to /etc/rc.local :
   
    /home/[your xubuntu username]/miner_launcher.sh 30 &amp;
   

   (will need to run nano as sudo, put the line above ""exit 0"")



#**8) Create an alias to easily check on cgminer:**

    sudo nano .bashrc


scroll to the end of the file and add these lines above the line that reads ""# enable programmable completion ...""


    alias monitor_cgminer='screen -x cgm'


(note that you'll need to restart your SSH connection for this to take effect)


#**9) Management/info:**

- The miner will autostart after 30 seconds after linux is booted every time the box is powered on.
- If you want to monitor output, SSH into the box and type ""monitor_cgminer"" at any time to jump to cgminer's screen output. When you're done, hit ctrl-A, ctrl-D to leave the screen session (and leave cgminer running on the box).

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.

This would amplify any sentiment against a crypto currency like the sentiment that LTC is over-valued.  

I think this has effected bitcoin less because most fiat intended to be used to get some would be going to mtgox. I could only imagine how hard BTC would crash if mtgox where to go away. So on the one hand litecoin being traded on mtgox will make it far more stable on the other hand it makes everyone more dependent on them and their ability to remain up and running. 

If anyone has a reason to support distributed exchanges it is people who support altcoins since they are more likely to be depended on fewer exchanges making them vulnerable to manipulation from denial of service attacks or hacks.

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

I find that the thread concurrency needs to be EXACT for optimum performance. If you are also using a 7870 then my thread concurrency values are likely to work for you. Like literally, to the last digit. I started with reaper but moved to cgminer with the [guiminer interface](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150331.0). Here's what i got:

For when i'm at the computer and want to interact, I get 300kh with this cgminer configuration: clock at **1150**, mem clock at **1350**, thread concurrency at **8192**, intensity **12**

I played around and found that If I increase the clock and mem clock up to 1200/1400 i get even better performance, but more prone to a gpu driver crash. Perhaps you can clock up even more. (1230/1430 got me 320kh before crashing)


Now for over night mining at 400kh I use a different config. clock at **950**, mem clock at **1450**, thread concurrency at **15232**, intensity **18**.
 I attempted this at 1000/1500 and got 420kh but the mem clock caused a crash at that level.
 

Another thing i learned is that stale/errors and pool errors can greatly reduce performance. A good pool i switched to is [http://give-me-ltc.com/](http://give-me-ltc.com/), and if you are using cgminer it has stratum support built in. Stratum makes a HUGE difference in efficient mining. All you need to do it put in the pool stratum address for the host.

Hope this helps my fellow 7870 miners! And if you have another card, find out the best thread concurrency to use... cause that is the one thing that can enhance or reduce performance, when paired with a proper clock to mem clock ratio.

1,t1_c98zbly,t3_1bpml0,0,,0,"I think this effect is relatively minor.  The actual coin counts in circulation between LTC and BTC are approximately equal at the moment.  Litecoins in circulation will grow faster than Bitcoins in circulation, but it's at a set rate which is a constant factor.  Since I think awareness of Litecoin is growing much faster than awareness of Bitcoin was when Bitcoin was at this percent of total circulation, faith in Litecoin should outpace the growth of new coins.

I said this in another comment, but it applies here too:

*The connection between expected value and the total number of coins circulated is overstated. Litecoins should not be equal to 0.25 Bitcoins just because there will be four times more Bitcoins. The value of a coin is only really tied to how much faith people put in it in general. This applies to all currencies.*

Even though I bought bitcoins at $25 and am mining them, I've made more money from litecoins (while investing less) and have switched half my miners to mining them. Litecoin mining is currently [more lucrative than bitcoin mining](http://dustcoin.com/mining)... and this will be even more so once LTC is on Mt.Gox and rises. I'm not the only one who sees this, which is why litecoin difficulty has doubled in the past week or so. PPC may end up being the best alternative mining option, but I would wait until at least next week to see where the price stabilizes. It should end up the third most valuable crypto-coin because it is different enough and Namecoin is currently mined as a byproduct of BTC mining, so there is no value from mining it. Miners put time+money into BTC, which gives it value because miners won't sell for less than what they put into it. But if you're mining BTC, NMC can be mined along side for no extra investment meaning miners give it little value.

If you buy now and LTC prices hit $10 in a month, you've more than quadrupled your money. You can't do that with bitcoins right now. PPC is a bad short term move because Vircurex will be back up tomorrow or Monday and everyone will pull their PPC out and put it on BTC-e hoping to get rich quick. The market will be flooded with cheap PPC for some time. If you're going to buy PPC, wait until next week and then hold onto it hoping Mt.Gox adds support for it also.

Mt.Gox support carries a lot of weight. People dipping their feet in the crypto-currency pool are doing it on Mt.Gox. The speculation of them adding LTC alone caused prices to more than quadruple in a couple days. But for every one person pointing out why LTC should rise over the next month or two, there are five people saying it is crashing in an attempt to buy cheap LTC themselves in anticipation of this rise. It is amazing to watch the trollbox on BTC-e and see how easy people can be manipulated. 

Anyway, that's my honest opinion. Most people who tell you to sell aren't looking out for your best interest, only theirs. Most people telling you to buy are also looking out for their best interest... it just so happens that it is your best interest too. Less people selling means less supply/more demand.

So more miners does not equal more coins! hence, this is not classic demand-supply. once we cleared that up, the way I see it more miners in litecoin means people are showing confidence in the future of the coin and helping to strengthen the network (this is crucial, as a 51% is viable for the weaker coins) which in turn raises the confidence among regular people that just want to use the coin to buy stuff (not sure there are that many in LTC right now) causing the value to go UP.

You could consider the total value of a currency as just the total faith and the value of a single coin is just ""FAITH / COIN-TOTAL.""  My arguments are just that the fundamentals of Litecoin are now strong enough that we should expect faith in Litecoin to be approximately that of what faith in Bitcoin was three months ago.

6. I'm a college student, not a crook or a millionaire. It's not like i have the money to handout free bitcoins to everyone, nor should i. I figured we could work together as a community to mine free coins and then i'd distribute them. I've proven that I will pay anyone who posts the btc/ltc/trc i promised, but you have't taken the time to try it out, instead you wrote 5 ridiculously dumb points.

With a traditional botnet you would certainly be more successful than with bitcoin, but I would argue that scrypt is safer in terms of high resource attacks. Specialty attacks are flat out impractical, and the amount of resources required to overtake litecoin's current GPU miners is also too high to consider, even in your largest botnets. Compared to bitcoin, or other SHA-2 based coins, where any entity who could drop a few million on ASICs could essentially hijack the network for much less of a cost.

* Put that webpage on a thumbdrive
* Reboot into a clean OS (USB live distro)
* Open said webpage
* Generate a page, save the wallet addresses in a txt (not the private key's though!)
* Save the page again (this **should** keep all your addresses/keys in the page. Re-open to verify.
* Just to make sure the wallets generated correctly, send some monies to one of the wallets you don't care about (and won't use again).
* Import the private key into the client (Help -&gt; Debug -&gt; importprivkey &lt;yourprivatekey&gt;)
* Wait for your money to show up to verify that it works
* Delete that wallet from the txt file

I find that the thread concurrency needs to be EXACT for optimum performance. If you are also using a 7870 then my thread concurrency values are likely to work for you. Like literally, to the last digit. I started with reaper but moved to cgminer with the [guiminer interface](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150331.0). Here's what i got:

For when i'm at the computer and want to interact, I get 300kh with this cgminer configuration: clock at **1150**, mem clock at **1350**, thread concurrency at **8192**, intensity **12**

I played around and found that If I increase the clock and mem clock up to 1200/1400 i get even better performance, but more prone to a gpu driver crash. Perhaps you can clock up even more. (1230/1430 got me 320kh before crashing)


Now for over night mining at 400kh I use a different config. clock at **950**, mem clock at **1450**, thread concurrency at **15232**, intensity **18**.
 I attempted this at 1000/1500 and got 420kh but the mem clock caused a crash at that level.
 

Another thing i learned is that stale/errors and pool errors can greatly reduce performance. A good pool i switched to is [http://give-me-ltc.com/](http://give-me-ltc.com/), and if you are using cgminer it has stratum support built in. Stratum makes a HUGE difference in efficient mining. All you need to do it put in the pool stratum address for the host.

Hope this helps my fellow 7870 miners! And if you have another card, find out the best thread concurrency to use... cause that is the one thing that can enhance or reduce performance, when paired with a proper clock to mem clock ratio.

EDIT: remember to set ur gpu fan on manual to keep things cool when overclocking!

There is a single most unintelligent assumption people make with these calculations for long-term estimates. They **don't use long-term estimates** at all.

If you really increase difficulty by 2928% per quarter, then also the price will increase to follow or lead difficulty, or both. Having bitcoin available, miners can switch back and forth to whichever is more profitable. They can also buy and sell the more profitable one, for the less profitable one, because they can see spot value and electricity costs instantly.



Your estimate should include this litecoin valuation in USD:

Week 1: 4

Week 2: 5.2

Week 3: 6.8

Week 4: 8.8

Week 5: 11.4

Week 6: 14.9

note 1: Hardware can be sold out with limited losses in case of litecoin crash. Litecoin can be sold out with complete losses in case of litecoin crash.


note 2: check the production parity between week 1 and week 13 as a quick method to speed calculations, week 1 gives 36*4.75 USD, week 13 would give the same value in 1 LTC, thus one LTC should be 171 USD to offer the same mining profitability.

Take the zipzap printout, goto your local moneygram location and pay that slip as a bill with CASH (Cash Only, make sure you bring cash).

Drive back home, and look at email from zipap and check the information on BlockChain.org and see funds been verify yet. Once they're verify BTC-E should notify you that you have BitCoins deposited.

Click on BTC/LTC button above the graph/chart. choose buy LCT, click on your BTC balance to autofill the amount and buy.

Took me about 10 min to fill the order.

Transfer you LTC to your own wallet.

DO NOT WATCH THE CHART!!! It will just drive you crazy.

    Take the zipzap printout, goto your local moneygram location and pay that slip as a bill with CASH (Cash Only, make sure you bring cash).

    Drive back home, and look at email from zipap and check the information on BlockChain.org and see funds been verify yet. Once they're verify BTC-E should notify you that you have BitCoins deposited.

    Click on BTC/LTC button above the graph/chart. choose buy LCT, click on your BTC balance to autofill the amount and buy.

Took me about 10 min to fill the order.

But i too feel the market for Litecoin, what you can do with it as of now, the exchange and wallet systems, really do need more time to amass support and real coherence and reselience. I think mathematically it makes sense for LTC to be 4x less than BTC due to the volume difference and mining difficulty difference. And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

Drive back home, and look at email from zipap and check the information on BlockChain.org and see funds been verify yet. Once they're verify BTC-E should notify you that you have BitCoins deposited.

Click on BTC/LTC button above the graph/chart. choose buy LCT, click on your BTC balance to autofill the amount and buy.

I said this in another comment, but it applies here too:

*The connection between expected value and the total number of coins circulated is overstated. Litecoins should not be equal to 0.25 Bitcoins just because there will be four times more Bitcoins. The value of a coin is only really tied to how much faith people put in it in general. This applies to all currencies.*

*You could consider the total value of a currency as just the total faith and the value of a single coin is just ""FAITH / COIN-TOTAL."" My arguments are just that the fundamentals of Litecoin are now strong enough that we should expect faith in Litecoin to be approximately that of what faith in Bitcoin was three months ago.

Bitcoin relies on SHA256 for this, while Litecoin uses scrypt. scrypt is designed to be ASIC resistant, so while Bitcoin mining will come to be dominated by ASICs, Litecoin mining will continue using GPUs. This means LTC mining will be more decentralized, as any kid with a gaming computer can help secure the network by mining LTC instead of having to shell out for a custom built, single purpose machine. scrypt also protects against large organizations custom building hardware to attempt a 51% attack. Ultimately I wouldn't say either algorithm is a better proof of work scheme and I believe BTC and LTC will coexist no problem.

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.  Forks only really matter to miners anyway since they invalidate block rewards, but valid transactions from the orphaned blocks would still wind up on the longest chain, so transactions are fairly safe.",,1431612407,True,False,Normif,1,1365559528,litecoin,c9c16pu,1365560223,t1_c9c16pu,0,t5_2szgd,,

And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.

Since I think awareness of Litecoin is growing much faster than awareness of Bitcoin was when Bitcoin was at this percent of total circulation, faith in Litecoin should outpace the growth of new coins.

I said this in another comment, but it applies here too:

*The connection between expected value and the total number of coins circulated is overstated. Litecoins should not be equal to 0.25 Bitcoins just because there will be four times more Bitcoins. The value of a coin is only really tied to how much faith people put in it in general. This applies to all currencies.*

*You could consider the total value of a currency as just the total faith and the value of a single coin is just ""FAITH / COIN-TOTAL."" My arguments are just that the fundamentals of Litecoin are now strong enough that we should expect faith in Litecoin to be approximately that of what faith in Bitcoin was three months ago. Since the actual coins in distribution between Bitcoin and Litecoin are nearly equal at the moment, that should mean Litecoins are worth about what Bitcoins were at the start of February.*",,1431662321,True,False,Normif,1,1365181791,litecoin,c9959un,False,t1_c9959un,0,t5_2szgd,,

Ofcourse in a few months there will hopefully be more direct ways, but for now, probably 90%+ on non mined litecoins are bought with bitcoins.

The immediate effect of mtgox support litecoins will be that the bitcoin value will go down as most people originally buying litecoins will simply exchange bitcoins for them. This will ofcourse change after the first few days assuming they allow for USD/LTC transactions. BTC-E for example lets you buy litecoins directly from USD, but PPCoins and Terracoins can only be bought using bitcoins, there is no TRC/USD or PPC/USD exchange book.

Third, I think that Litecoin is actually more succesful for not trying to reinvent the wheel away from the strong foundations of Bitcoin.  LTC only has a few changes from BTC, and that will make it easier for market tools to be made universal while also easing the learning curve and providing confidence to those who already trust in BTC.

Fourth,  there have been hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in GPUs for BTC which will now be given an early and unprofitable retirement when ASICs fully overpower them on the BTC network.  LTC is the natural place for that mining hardware to go to maintain profitability; the market cap of LTC is approximately 1/80th that of BTC and that's more than an order of magnitude better than any other altcoin.  See: http://dustcoin.com/mining  

Litecoin has a proven purpose in helping provide security to cryptocurrency markets, a solid core of miners, significant capital invested in it already, and growing interest with merchant services and marketplaces.

I documented the process and sent it to a couple friends with zero linux experience (I know you said you're comfortable with linux, but just in case a linux newbie is interested in giving this a shot...), and they were able to get up and running in a matter of hours with their own rigs. We're getting about 620 kH/sec on each GPU with modest overclocks, which is exactly the same hashrate that I see in win7.  
  
Here is exactly what I sent to them:  

#**1) Configure BIOS settings:**

   - disable everything we're not using (audio, serial port, firewire, etc)
   - change power options to automatically start system whenever power is restored (in case power goes out while you're away, also makes it easier to power on with no switch...)
   - make sure that USB flash stick is first in boot order


#**2) Install Xubuntu desktop x64 from temporary CD drive (or another USB stick) to your USB stick**

   - get the installation image here:  http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs-Xubuntu/12.10/release/xubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso
   - use 8GB+ USB stick, partition 5500mb for root (/), 315mb for swap, and the remaining amount for home (/home)
   - make sure to check auto-login box during install
   - boot into desktop when done

   
#**3) Install AMD Catalyst drivers:**

   (open terminal)


    sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates fglrx-updates-dev
    sudo aticonfig --lsa
    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial
    sudo reboot
   

   (after reboot, check that everything works:)
   

    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --odgt


   (you should see all of your cards with hardware monitoring enabled)

   *Important: you will likely need to have something plugged into each video card to prevent the OS from idling it. The easiest way to do this is to make a dummy plug for each card. Instructions: 
   http://www.overclock.net/t/384733/the-30-second-dummy-plug

   If you add/remove video cards later, re-run this:   sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial 


#**4) Install SSH, curl, &amp; update all packages**

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server byobu
   

   (the rest can be done via SSH if you wish - make sure to forward port 22 on your firewall to the box if you want to connect from outside your network)  
   (As for an SSH client, I recommend Putty - you can copy each of the remaining commands and then right-click them into your putty window instead of typing them manually)
      

    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade



#**5) Install CGMiner:**

    wget http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/cgminer/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2
    tar jxvf cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2


   (optional - delete the archive)

    rm *.bz2


   (optional - check if cgminer detects all GPUs properly:)

    cd cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    ./cgminer -n


#**6) Create cgminer startup script:**


    nano mine_litecoins.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/sh
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    cd /home/[your xubuntu username]/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built

   (save the file &amp; quit nano)


    chmod +x mine_litecoins.sh
   
   

#**7) Create auto-start scripts**


    nano miner_launcher.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/bash
    DEFAULT_DELAY=0
    if [ ""x$1"" = ""x"" -o ""x$1"" = ""xnone"" ]; then

   Add this line to /etc/rc.local :
   
    /home/[your xubuntu username]/miner_launcher.sh 30 &amp;
   

   (will need to run nano as sudo, put the line above ""exit 0"")



#**8) Create an alias to easily check on cgminer:**

    sudo nano .bashrc


scroll to the end of the file and add these lines above the line that reads ""# enable programmable completion ...""


    alias monitor_cgminer='screen -x cgm'


(note that you'll need to restart your SSH connection for this to take effect)


#**9) Management/info:**

- The miner will autostart after 30 seconds after linux is booted every time the box is powered on.
- If you want to monitor output, SSH into the box and type ""monitor_cgminer"" at any time to jump to cgminer's screen output. When you're done, hit ctrl-A, ctrl-D to leave the screen session (and leave cgminer running on the box).

So more miners does not equal more coins! hence, this is not classic demand-supply. once we cleared that up, the way I see it more miners in litecoin means people are showing confidence in the future of the coin and helping to strengthen the network (this is crucial, as a 51% is viable for the weaker coins) which in turn raises the confidence among regular people that just want to use the coin to buy stuff (not sure there are that many in LTC right now) causing the value to go UP.

If this happened to Bitcoin because they started bumping the transaction limit, that would be a help to Litecoin or similar, because then you would need a currency that could handle smaller transactions.

Of course, the amount of harm this would cause Bitcoin depends on the value of it when it starts ""nudging"" that theoretical limit.  If you have sites selling memberships or similar for $5 a month, right now its not a problem.  But if Bitcoin hits $100 per, then .05 would be the cost of such a site, roughly, and if they start having to ""bump the lower limit"" up to keep under the limit or at least eliminate the backlog, then you might be rendering it useless to sites that do small transactions.

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.

In 15 minutes you can be fairly well assured your transaction is finalized in the network, compared to an hour for Bitcoin.  For ecommerce applications, this is a vital point.  Green addresses can help, but not everyone will want to use them or know which to really trust.

Litecoin offers a directly integrated means of providing fast trust in arbitrary transactions by not aiming to make it possible for interstellar commerce to occur over the protocol (which would be the only real need for such a long block target).

You're also wrong that scrypt provides no protection from ASICs.  The author of the algorithm specifically created it as a means of protecting against ASIC attacks.

And you can't move Bitcoin ASICs to scrypt mining, so Litecoin won't hurt the mining rate of the Bitcoin network at all.  On the contrary, Litecoin will take advantage of all of the displaced GPUs which would have no reason to mine Bitcoin anyway and provide a means of allowing them to continue securing the network.  Litecoin will offer redundancy to the Bitcoin network when services integrate support for both.

Bitcoin's and Litecoin's improvements can work in tandem.  Again, other cryptocoins created before and after Litecoin have failed while Litecoin continues gathering momentum, so there's really little risk of arbitrary chains gaining hold and hurting the platform.

If this happened to Bitcoin because they started bumping the transaction limit, that would be a help to Litecoin or similar, because then you would need a currency that could handle smaller transactions.

Of course, the amount of harm this would cause Bitcoin depends on the value of it when it starts ""nudging"" that theoretical limit.  If you have sites selling memberships or similar for $5 a month, right now its not a problem.  But if Bitcoin hits $100 per, then .05 would be the cost of such a site, roughly, and if they start having to ""bump the lower limit"" up to keep under the limit or at least eliminate the backlog, then you might be rendering it useless to sites that do small transactions.

The technical advantage of a diversity of cryptocurrency systems isn't theoretical, it's proven, for instance *when Bitcoin forked recently Litecoin was fine*.  People have since then obliviously kept repeating the argument that Litecoin isn't substantially different enough to matter, but that argument *must* fall against the fact that it *did* recently actually practically matter!!  Surely there are other classes of failure/attack to which both systems are vulnerable, but *that* is what's still theoretical.  Litecoin has actually allowed cryptocurrency transactions to continue during a disruption of the Bitcoin network. 

Having a second set of currency markets is also a useful redundancy.  For instance Litecoin has recently been trading relatively steadily for $4-$5, even as that's gone from being ฿0.04 to being ฿0.02!  The LTC price is happy to diverge from the BTC price, so it allows the cryptocurrency market as a whole to be more diverse and stable. 

There isn't necessarily any benefit to Litecoin *for you* and indeed that is another sort of useful diversity.  You may find that Litecoin doesn't interest you and that you don't spend much time paying attention to it or involved in the community around it, but meanwhile other people with other tastes will find that they *are* interested in it.

8,t3_1bmsag,t3_1bmsag,0,,0,"cgminer might be able to get a better hashrate out of the 6xxx series, but I'll just write up a quick little guide how you would set it up in Reaper:

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

    host notroll.in
    port 6332

    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well
---

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

---
    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices
            0       Pitcairn
    Program built from saved binary.
    LTC buffer size: 384MB.
            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.
---

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0
    
    mine litecoin

* Open said webpage
* Generate a page, save the wallet addresses in a txt (not the private key's though!)
* Save the page again (this **should** keep all your addresses/keys in the page. Re-open to verify.
* Just to make sure the wallets generated correctly, send some monies to one of the wallets you don't care about (and won't use again).
* Import the private key into the client (Help -&gt; Debug -&gt; importprivkey &lt;yourprivatekey&gt;)
* Wait for your money to show up to verify that it works

* Save to USB

This applies to all currencies.

You could consider the total value of a currency as just the total faith and the value of a single coin is just ""FAITH / COIN-TOTAL.""  My arguments are just that the fundamentals of Litecoin are now strong enough that we should expect faith in Litecoin to be approximately that of what faith in Bitcoin was three months ago.  Since the actual coins in distribution between Bitcoin and Litecoin are nearly equal at the moment, that should mean Litecoins are worth about what Bitcoins were at the start of February.

I find that the thread concurrency needs to be EXACT for optimum performance. If you are also using a 7870 then my thread concurrency values are likely to work for you. Like literally, to the last digit. I started with reaper but moved to cgminer with the [guiminer interface](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150331.0). Here's what i got:

For when i'm at the computer and want to interact, I get 300kh with this cgminer configuration: clock at **1150**, mem clock at **1350**, thread concurrency at **8192**, intensity **12**

I played around and found that If I increase the clock and mem clock up to 1200/1400 i get even better performance, but more prone to a gpu driver crash. Perhaps you can clock up even more. (1230/1430 got me 320kh before crashing)


Now for over night mining at 400kh I use a different config. clock at **950**, mem clock at **1450**, thread concurrency at **15232**, intensity **18**.
 I attempted this at 1000/1500 and got 420kh but the mem clock caused a crash at that level.
 

Another thing i learned is that stale/errors and pool errors can greatly reduce performance. A good pool i switched to is [http://give-me-ltc.com/](http://give-me-ltc.com/), and if you are using cgminer it has stratum support built in. Stratum makes a HUGE difference in efficient mining. All you need to do it put in the pool stratum address for the host.

Hope this helps my fellow 7870 miners! And if you have another card, find out the best thread concurrency to use... cause that is the one thing that can enhance or reduce performance, when paired with a proper clock to mem clock ratio.

I don't know much about Litecoin, but if it's anything like Bitcoin, the issue is with the clients agreeing on results. If over half of the Bitcoin clients on the network were somehow compromised and now were running different code than the official client, they would now become authoritative and the results of the compromised clients would become the actual, definitive results.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't feel that a mining pool reflects the situation I've just described. The clients are all - in theory - doing what they are supposed to be doing. As long as more than 50% of the nodes on the network are running the official client, it's still working as intended.

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

I covered a bit about this in an earlier topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

The problem with buying on Mt.Gox and sending to BTC-e is that Mt.Gox's bitcoin price is usually a few-to-several dollars higher. That means once they arrive at BTC-e, you can't sell them for what you just bought them for on Mt.Gox. You can try to minimize the loss by holding them in BTC-e until the price reaches the price you paid at Mt.Gox... but there is no guarantee it will or how long it will take.

Regardless, that is the easiest way to buy litecoins. Try to do it when the exchanges are only a dollar or two apart. When sending from Mt.Gox, make sure to pay the transaction fee so it gets processed faster (miners like fees, they take priority.) This minimizes the time spent in transit and helps you get the bitcoins in BTC-e before the price changes too much.

Once you have bitcoins in BTC-e, there are two ways to get litecoins. You can sell them for USD and use the USD to buy litecoins, or you can trade bitcoins directly for litecoins. They both will result in roughly the same amount of litecoins... but occasionally there is a big enough difference between the two to net you a couple extra litecoins. It is something you'll have to calculate yourself to see which one results in more litecoins.

As mentioned before, the biggest thing holding back litecoins right now is how difficult it is to buy them with USD. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to get USD directly to BTC-e, unless you hit the BitInstant lottery where BTC-e shows up as a Send To option. This is why Mt.Gox trading litecoins is going to be huge. It is very easy to get USD into Mt.Gox.

There is a single most unintelligent assumption people make with these calculations for long-term estimates. They **don't use long-term estimates** at all.

If you really increase difficulty by 2928% per quarter, then also the price will increase to follow or lead difficulty, or both. Having bitcoin available, miners can switch back and forth to whichever is more profitable. They can also buy and sell the more profitable one, for the less profitable one, because they can see spot value and electricity costs instantly.



Your estimate should include this litecoin valuation in USD:

Week 1: 4

Week 2: 5.2

Week 3: 6.8

Week 4: 8.8

Week 5: 11.4

note 1: Hardware can be sold out with limited losses in case of litecoin crash. Litecoin can be sold out with complete losses in case of litecoin crash.


note 2: check the production parity between week 1 and week 13 as a quick method to speed calculations, week 1 gives 36*4.75 USD, week 13 would give the same value in 1 LTC, thus one LTC should be 171 USD to offer the same mining profitability.

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

In practice, this was not the case, as GPUs have overrun the Litecoin network. While it will be more expensive to develop an ASIC for Litecoin mining, it is certainly not impossible.

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

---
    host notroll.in
    port 6332
    user linkthestraw.1
    pass 12345
    
    protocol litecoin
    
    worksize 256
    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices

            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0

13,t1_c99rjk6,t3_1bstzz,0,,0,"No I didn't first find out about bitcoins and get involved until relatively late, but didn't make the same mistake with litecoins. Even though I bought bitcoins at $25 and am mining them, I've made more money from litecoins (while investing less) and have switched half my miners to mining them. Litecoin mining is currently [more lucrative than bitcoin mining](http://dustcoin.com/mining)... and this will be even more so once LTC is on Mt.Gox and rises. I'm not the only one who sees this, which is why litecoin difficulty has doubled in the past week or so. PPC may end up being the best alternative mining option, but I would wait until at least next week to see where the price stabilizes. It should end up the third most valuable crypto-coin because it is different enough and Namecoin is currently mined as a byproduct of BTC mining, so there is no value from mining it. Miners put time+money into BTC, which gives it value because miners won't sell for less than what they put into it. But if you're mining BTC, NMC can be mined along side for no extra investment meaning miners give it little value.

If you buy now and LTC prices hit $10 in a month, you've more than quadrupled your money. You can't do that with bitcoins right now. PPC is a bad short term move because Vircurex will be back up tomorrow or Monday and everyone will pull their PPC out and put it on BTC-e hoping to get rich quick. The market will be flooded with cheap PPC for some time. If you're going to buy PPC, wait until next week and then hold onto it hoping Mt.Gox adds support for it also.

Mt.Gox support carries a lot of weight. People dipping their feet in the crypto-currency pool are doing it on Mt.Gox. The speculation of them adding LTC alone caused prices to more than quadruple in a couple days. But for every one person pointing out why LTC should rise over the next month or two, there are five people saying it is crashing in an attempt to buy cheap LTC themselves in anticipation of this rise. It is amazing to watch the trollbox on BTC-e and see how easy people can be manipulated. 

Anyway, that's my honest opinion. Most people who tell you to sell aren't looking out for your best interest, only theirs. Most people telling you to buy are also looking out for their best interest... it just so happens that it is your best interest too. Less people selling means less supply/more demand. More demand means higher prices. ",,1431651247,True,False,milone,13,1365273063,litecoin,c99sbfq,False,t1_c99sbfq,0,t5_2szgd,,

11,t1_c97rg7n,t3_1blg6y,0,,0,"News from the Mt.GOX IRC channel (from MT.GOX officials) is that MT.GOX will support LTC by the end of April.  Most people are unaware of the timeframe and there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether they even will support it (there are still many people who think it was an April Fool's joke).

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Knowing that, I don't think the news is ""priced in"" very much at all, and I expect LTC to rise significantly from wherever it is when LTC trading opens on MT.GOX before the end of the month.


Addressing your other points:

&gt; No idea how much of these LTCs are being hoarded by miners and are ready to flood the market with cheap supply. Maybe someone can give me more info as to this issue. I am new to crypto, but have traded currencies for years.

People on the Litecoin forums have been keeping track of the large wallets.  There's really only a couple dozen people with very large numbers of Litecoins.  Many of those have been bought in the last month it appears, so it doesn't seem like there are many peoeple who held onto big stacks from when they were easy to mine.

&gt; The amount of LTC to be in circulation vs BTC in circulation. Just seems like LTC/BTC should be trading lower based on this.

If coin counts were the only factor, LTC/BTC would be around 0.25, which is much higher than where it is hovering at around 0.04-0.05 recently, so I don't understand your argument there.",,1431685526,True,False,Normif,11,1365013781,litecoin,c97st7j,1365014226,t1_c97st7j,0,t5_2szgd,,

Take the zipzap printout, goto your local moneygram location and pay that slip as a bill with CASH (Cash Only, make sure you bring cash).

Drive back home, and look at email from zipap and check the information on BlockChain.org and see funds been verify yet. Once they're verify BTC-E should notify you that you have BitCoins deposited.

Click on BTC/LTC button above the graph/chart. choose buy LCT, click on your BTC balance to autofill the amount and buy.

Took me about 10 min to fill the order.

Transfer you LTC to your own wallet.

DO NOT WATCH THE CHART!!! It will just drive you crazy.

* Put that webpage on a thumbdrive
* Reboot into a clean OS (USB live distro)
* Open said webpage
* Generate a page, save the wallet addresses in a txt (not the private key's though!)
* Save the page again (this **should** keep all your addresses/keys in the page. Re-open to verify.
* Just to make sure the wallets generated correctly, send some monies to one of the wallets you don't care about (and won't use again).
* Import the private key into the client (Help -&gt; Debug -&gt; importprivkey &lt;yourprivatekey&gt;)

The problem with Bitcoin is not that there is too much mining, but that there is now hardware that was designed specifically for mining.  This hardware is so much more cost-efficient that GPUs are unable to keep up.  This will just get worse over the next few months.

Contrast that to Litecoin where it was designed with an algorithm that was created specifically to avoid allowing more efficient hardware to be created.  That means your GPUs can mine fairly with other GPUs and your profits can stay high enough to make it worthwhile.

Most people are unaware of the timeframe and there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether they even will support it (there are still many people who think it was an April Fool's joke).

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Knowing that, I don't think the news is ""priced in"" very much at all, and I expect LTC to rise significantly from wherever it is when LTC trading opens on MT.GOX before the end of the month.


Addressing your other points:

&gt; No idea how much of these LTCs are being hoarded by miners and are ready to flood the market with cheap supply. Maybe someone can give me more info as to this issue. I am new to crypto, but have traded currencies for years.

People on the Litecoin forums have been keeping track of the large wallets.  There's really only a couple dozen people with very large numbers of Litecoins.  Many of those have been bought in the last month it appears, so it doesn't seem like there are many peoeple who held onto big stacks from when they were easy to mine.

&gt; The amount of LTC to be in circulation vs BTC in circulation. Just seems like LTC/BTC should be trading lower based on this.

* Save the page again (this **should** keep all your addresses/keys in the page. Re-open to verify.

8,t3_1c1sqv,t3_1c1sqv,1,,0,"I recently built a linux-based mining rig with 3x 7950s in it. I documented the process and sent it to a couple friends with zero linux experience (I know you said you're comfortable with linux, but just in case a linux newbie is interested in giving this a shot...), and they were able to get up and running in a matter of hours with their own rigs. We're getting about 620 kH/sec on each GPU with modest overclocks, which is exactly the same hashrate that I see in win7.  
  
Here is exactly what I sent to them:  

#**1) Configure BIOS settings:**

   - disable everything we're not using (audio, serial port, firewire, etc)
   - change power options to automatically start system whenever power is restored (in case power goes out while you're away, also makes it easier to power on with no switch...)
   - make sure that USB flash stick is first in boot order


#**2) Install Xubuntu desktop x64 from temporary CD drive (or another USB stick) to your USB stick**

   - get the installation image here:  http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs-Xubuntu/12.10/release/xubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso
   - use 8GB+ USB stick, partition 5500mb for root (/), 315mb for swap, and the remaining amount for home (/home)
   - make sure to check auto-login box during install
   - boot into desktop when done

   
#**3) Install AMD Catalyst drivers:**

   (open terminal)


    sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates fglrx-updates-dev
    sudo aticonfig --lsa
    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial
    sudo reboot
   

   (after reboot, check that everything works:)
   

    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --odgt


   (you should see all of your cards with hardware monitoring enabled)

   *Important: you will likely need to have something plugged into each video card to prevent the OS from idling it. The easiest way to do this is to make a dummy plug for each card. Instructions: 
   http://www.overclock.net/t/384733/the-30-second-dummy-plug

   If you add/remove video cards later, re-run this:   sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial 


#**4) Install SSH, curl, &amp; update all packages**

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server byobu
   

   (the rest can be done via SSH if you wish - make sure to forward port 22 on your firewall to the box if you want to connect from outside your network)  
   (As for an SSH client, I recommend Putty - you can copy each of the remaining commands and then right-click them into your putty window instead of typing them manually)
      

    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade



#**5) Install CGMiner:**

    wget http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/cgminer/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2
    tar jxvf cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2


   (optional - delete the archive)

    rm *.bz2


   (optional - check if cgminer detects all GPUs properly:)

    cd cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    ./cgminer -n


#**6) Create cgminer startup script:**


    nano mine_litecoins.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/sh
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    cd /home/[your xubuntu username]/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built
    ./cgminer --scrypt -I 19 -g 1 -w 256 --thread-concurrency 21712 --auto-fan -o stratum+tcp://notroll.in:3333 -u [your notroll.in workername] -p 12345 --failover-only -o stratum+tcp://coinotron.com:3334 -u [your coinotron workername] -p 12345


   (save the file &amp; quit nano)


    chmod +x mine_litecoins.sh
   
   

#**7) Create auto-start scripts**


    nano miner_launcher.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/bash
    DEFAULT_DELAY=0
    if [ ""x$1"" = ""x"" -o ""x$1"" = ""xnone"" ]; then
       DELAY=$DEFAULT_DELAY
    else
       DELAY=$1
    fi
    sleep $DELAY
    su [your xubuntu username] -c ""screen -dmS cgm /home/[your xubuntu username]/mine_litecoins.sh""


   (save the file &amp; quit nano)


    chmod +x miner_launcher.sh
   

   
   Add this line to /etc/rc.local :
   
    /home/[your xubuntu username]/miner_launcher.sh 30 &amp;
   

   (will need to run nano as sudo, put the line above ""exit 0"")



#**8) Create an alias to easily check on cgminer:**

    sudo nano .bashrc


scroll to the end of the file and add these lines above the line that reads ""# enable programmable completion ...""


    alias monitor_cgminer='screen -x cgm'


(note that you'll need to restart your SSH connection for this to take effect)


#**9) Management/info:**

- The miner will autostart after 30 seconds after linux is booted every time the box is powered on.
- If you want to monitor output, SSH into the box and type ""monitor_cgminer"" at any time to jump to cgminer's screen output. When you're done, hit ctrl-A, ctrl-D to leave the screen session (and leave cgminer running on the box).
- use ./miner_launcher.sh to manually start the miner (if you kill it, or quit out of it, etc)",,1431607752,True,False,rbbrdckybk,8,1365602353,litecoin,c9cax2h,1365604066,t1_c9cax2h,0,t5_2szgd,,

There are many alternative chains which were created before Litecoin which have failed.  Litecoin is only taking off because it adds something which Bitcoin can't do on its own and can help Bitcoin succeed.  The only people learning about alternative cryptocurrencies right now are those who already know about Bitcoin, and the sort of skepticism you have about them is natural for everyone to have about them.

So then, why is Litecoin succeeding if the natural response to it is your skepticism?  Well that's what I wrote about.",,1431662260,True,False,Normif,1,1365182134,litecoin,c995egl,False,t1_c995egl,0,t5_2szgd,,

Collect a pot of like 10,000 LTC and offer it as rewards, incentives, assistance to people trying to implement LTC in their online store. ""Will you accept LTC? No!

 * Litecoin needs better graphics. I tried finding a Litecoin logo in SVG the other day and couldn't find anything. 

 * Documentation and help (someone owns litecoinwiki.com but, it's sitting on parked page). We need people to understand where to get Litecoin and how to mine it and spend it.

 * Write to the other exchanges and ask them to support LTC. If it's a minor tweak, and it makes them money what do they care? They make money on every transaction. I asked Mt. Gox to set up a Litecoin Exchange.

But i too feel the market for Litecoin, what you can do with it as of now, the exchange and wallet systems, really do need more time to amass support and real coherence and reselience. I think mathematically it makes sense for LTC to be 4x less than BTC due to the volume difference and mining difficulty difference. And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

11,t1_c97rg7n,t3_1blg6y,0,,0,"News from the Mt.GOX IRC channel (from MT.GOX officials) is that MT.GOX will support LTC by the end of April.  Most people are unaware of the timeframe and there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether they even will support it (there are still many people who think it was an April Fool's joke).

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Knowing that, I don't think the news is ""priced in"" very much at all, and I expect LTC to rise significantly from wherever it is when LTC trading opens on MT.GOX before the end of the month.


Addressing your other points:

&gt; No idea how much of these LTCs are being hoarded by miners and are ready to flood the market with cheap supply. Maybe someone can give me more info as to this issue. I am new to crypto, but have traded currencies for years.

People on the Litecoin forums have been keeping track of the large wallets.  There's really only a couple dozen people with very large numbers of Litecoins.  Many of those have been bought in the last month it appears, so it doesn't seem like there are many peoeple who held onto big stacks from when they were easy to mine.

&gt; The amount of LTC to be in circulation vs BTC in circulation. Just seems like LTC/BTC should be trading lower based on this.

This would amplify any sentiment against a crypto currency like the sentiment that LTC is over-valued.  

I think this has effected bitcoin less because most fiat intended to be used to get some would be going to mtgox. I could only imagine how hard BTC would crash if mtgox where to go away.

While it's true, that since we're just mapping keys to addresses, it could pose a threat to your coins in the event we're hacked, but it's pretty safe to say that that's unlikely; the server it's running on has been hardened in every aspect, and we've had no breaches in the year or two we've been running.",,1431634959,True,False,compgenius999,2,1363707701,litecoin,c8yhrud,1363707999,t1_c8yhrud,0,t5_2szgd,,

If this happened to Bitcoin because they started bumping the transaction limit, that would be a help to Litecoin or similar, because then you would need a currency that could handle smaller transactions.

Of course, the amount of harm this would cause Bitcoin depends on the value of it when it starts ""nudging"" that theoretical limit.  If you have sites selling memberships or similar for $5 a month, right now its not a problem.  But if Bitcoin hits $100 per, then .05 would be the cost of such a site, roughly, and if they start having to ""bump the lower limit"" up to keep under the limit or at least eliminate the backlog, then you might be rendering it useless to sites that do small transactions.

But, then again, that could be where Litecoin or similar could move in, and actually semi-complement Bitcoin.

I am pretty new to the whole mining scene, but will attempt to answer your question to the best of my current ability. 

1)A wallet is exactly that, a storage device for your currency in this case Litecoins. Using the Litecoin-QT wallet it is easy to create a secure key to encrypt your wallet from the drop down menu. One thing to consider is there are two types of wallets. The first is a local wallet stored on the computer you are mining on. The other is an online wallet(the type that most pools use). From what I gather best practice seems to be, to set your pool wallet to automatically transfer funds from your pool wallet to your local wallet. 

2) In order to setup solo mining, you will need to basically run your litecoin-qt as a server which the mining software will use to connect to the litecoin server. So when/if you solve a block your litecoins will be deposited into the wallet you are using to mine with. Are you set on solo mining? After doing some research and trying solo mining, it seems to me that pool mining offers almost identical payout in the long run. The major benefit though is that pool mining starts making currency the second you start mining, assuming that you use a PPS pool. Only downside to pool mining is the fee associated with withdrawing currency from the pool to your wallet.

This would amplify any sentiment against a crypto currency like the sentiment that LTC is over-valued.  

I think this has effected bitcoin less because most fiat intended to be used to get some would be going to mtgox. I could only imagine how hard BTC would crash if mtgox where to go away. So on the one hand litecoin being traded on mtgox will make it far more stable on the other hand it makes everyone more dependent on them and their ability to remain up and running. 

If anyone has a reason to support distributed exchanges it is people who support altcoins since they are more likely to be depended on fewer exchanges making them vulnerable to manipulation from denial of service attacks or hacks.

I find that the thread concurrency needs to be EXACT for optimum performance. If you are also using a 7870 then my thread concurrency values are likely to work for you. Like literally, to the last digit. I started with reaper but moved to cgminer with the [guiminer interface](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150331.0). Here's what i got:

For when i'm at the computer and want to interact, I get 300kh with this cgminer configuration: clock at **1150**, mem clock at **1350**, thread concurrency at **8192**, intensity **12**

I played around and found that If I increase the clock and mem clock up to 1200/1400 i get even better performance, but more prone to a gpu driver crash. Perhaps you can clock up even more. (1230/1430 got me 320kh before crashing)


Now for over night mining at 400kh I use a different config. clock at **950**, mem clock at **1450**, thread concurrency at **15232**, intensity **18**.
 I attempted this at 1000/1500 and got 420kh but the mem clock caused a crash at that level.
 

Another thing i learned is that stale/errors and pool errors can greatly reduce performance. A good pool i switched to is [http://give-me-ltc.com/](http://give-me-ltc.com/), and if you are using cgminer it has stratum support built in. Stratum makes a HUGE difference in efficient mining. All you need to do it put in the pool stratum address for the host.

Hope this helps my fellow 7870 miners! And if you have another card, find out the best thread concurrency to use... cause that is the one thing that can enhance or reduce performance, when paired with a proper clock to mem clock ratio.

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.

I find that the thread concurrency needs to be EXACT for optimum performance. If you are also using a 7870 then my thread concurrency values are likely to work for you. Like literally, to the last digit. I started with reaper but moved to cgminer with the [guiminer interface](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150331.0). Here's what i got:

For when i'm at the computer and want to interact, I get 300kh with this cgminer configuration: clock at **1150**, mem clock at **1350**, thread concurrency at **8192**, intensity **12**

I played around and found that If I increase the clock and mem clock up to 1200/1400 i get even better performance, but more prone to a gpu driver crash. Perhaps you can clock up even more. (1230/1430 got me 320kh before crashing)


Now for over night mining at 400kh I use a different config. clock at **950**, mem clock at **1450**, thread concurrency at **15232**, intensity **18**.
 I attempted this at 1000/1500 and got 420kh but the mem clock caused a crash at that level.
 

Another thing i learned is that stale/errors and pool errors can greatly reduce performance. A good pool i switched to is [http://give-me-ltc.com/](http://give-me-ltc.com/), and if you are using cgminer it has stratum support built in. Stratum makes a HUGE difference in efficient mining. All you need to do it put in the pool stratum address for the host.

Hope this helps my fellow 7870 miners! And if you have another card, find out the best thread concurrency to use... cause that is the one thing that can enhance or reduce performance, when paired with a proper clock to mem clock ratio.

In 15 minutes you can be fairly well assured your transaction is finalized in the network, compared to an hour for Bitcoin.  For ecommerce applications, this is a vital point.

Litecoin offers a directly integrated means of providing fast trust in arbitrary transactions by not aiming to make it possible for interstellar commerce to occur over the protocol (which would be the only real need for such a long block target).

You're also wrong that scrypt provides no protection from ASICs.  The author of the algorithm specifically created it as a means of protecting against ASIC attacks.

And you can't move Bitcoin ASICs to scrypt mining, so Litecoin won't hurt the mining rate of the Bitcoin network at all.  On the contrary, Litecoin will take advantage of all of the displaced GPUs which would have no reason to mine Bitcoin anyway and provide a means of allowing them to continue securing the network.  Litecoin will offer redundancy to the Bitcoin network when services integrate support for both.

Bitcoin's and Litecoin's improvements can work in tandem.

Scrypt is actually a better basis algorithm (than Bitcoin's SHA256) and will make it more difficult to produce specialized FPGAs or ASICs.  This means that all of the GPU miners who find that Bitcoin is no longer profitable as difficulty rises from ASICs over the next few months will be looking to mine another cryptocoin.  Given that Litecoin is the most technically sound and widest used altcoin, it is the natural option.
It's actually good that they don't differ much otherwise.

I don't see any major flaws in either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and I think that Litecoin is using a better basis algorithm, is inheriting all of the good parts of Bitcoin, and is not messing anything up from it's parent.  I also think that it will be good for cryptocurrency long-term to have two currencies because it will improve the overall stability and safety of the system of cryptocurrencies as a whole.

I'm also very surprised that mining of Litecoins hasn't picked up even MORE rapidly than it has in the last couple of weeks as Bitcoins have risen.

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

They believed that keeping the memory requirements at 128k would give  a clear advantage to CPUs, given the speed of L1 and L2 cache. In practice, this was not the case, as GPUs have overrun the Litecoin network. While it will be more expensive to develop an ASIC for Litecoin mining, it is certainly not impossible.

8,t3_1bmsag,t3_1bmsag,0,,0,"cgminer might be able to get a better hashrate out of the 6xxx series, but I'll just write up a quick little guide how you would set it up in Reaper:

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

---
    host notroll.in
    port 6332
    user linkthestraw.1
    pass 12345
    
    protocol litecoin
    
    worksize 256
    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well
---

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

---
    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices
            0       Pitcairn
    Program built from saved binary.
    LTC buffer size: 384MB.
            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.
---

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0
    
    mine litecoin
---

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.  Forks only really matter to miners anyway since they invalidate block rewards, but valid transactions from the orphaned blocks would still wind up on the longest chain, so transactions are fairly safe.",,1431612407,True,False,Normif,1,1365559528,litecoin,c9c16pu,1365560223,t1_c9c16pu,0,t5_2szgd,,

8,t3_1bmsag,t3_1bmsag,0,,0,"cgminer might be able to get a better hashrate out of the 6xxx series, but I'll just write up a quick little guide how you would set it up in Reaper:

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

---
    host notroll.in
    port 6332
    user linkthestraw.1
    pass 12345
    
    protocol litecoin
    
    worksize 256
    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well
---

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

---
    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices
            0       Pitcairn
    Program built from saved binary.
    LTC buffer size: 384MB.
            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.
---

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0
    
    mine litecoin
---


Step 6. Open 'reaper.exe'.

If it's not secured well then there's no value to the coins.  Thus, it's in everyone's interest to trade the coins.

Take the zipzap printout, goto your local moneygram location and pay that slip as a bill with CASH (Cash Only, make sure you bring cash).

Drive back home, and look at email from zipap and check the information on BlockChain.org and see funds been verify yet. Once they're verify BTC-E should notify you that you have BitCoins deposited.

Click on BTC/LTC button above the graph/chart. choose buy LCT, click on your BTC balance to autofill the amount and buy.

Transfer you LTC to your own wallet.

Scrypt is actually a better basis algorithm (than Bitcoin's SHA256) and will make it more difficult to produce specialized FPGAs or ASICs.  This means that all of the GPU miners who find that Bitcoin is no longer profitable as difficulty rises from ASICs over the next few months will be looking to mine another cryptocoin.  Given that Litecoin is the most technically sound and widest used altcoin, it is the natural option.
It's actually good that they don't differ much otherwise.

I don't see any major flaws in either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and I think that Litecoin is using a better basis algorithm, is inheriting all of the good parts of Bitcoin, and is not messing anything up from it's parent.  I also think that it will be good for cryptocurrency long-term to have two currencies because it will improve the overall stability and safety of the system of cryptocurrencies as a whole.

I'm also very surprised that mining of Litecoins hasn't picked up even MORE rapidly than it has in the last couple of weeks as Bitcoins have risen.  Litecoin difficulty is around 90 right now, and given current exchange rates and difficulties I expect that for nearly all GPU miners they would see more profit from LTC until Litecoin difficulty is over 120.

But i too feel the market for Litecoin, what you can do with it as of now, the exchange and wallet systems, really do need more time to amass support and real coherence and reselience. I think mathematically it makes sense for LTC to be 4x less than BTC due to the volume difference and mining difficulty difference. And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

8,t3_1bmsag,t3_1bmsag,0,,0,"cgminer might be able to get a better hashrate out of the 6xxx series, but I'll just write up a quick little guide how you would set it up in Reaper:

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

---
    host notroll.in
    port 6332
    user linkthestraw.1
    pass 12345
    
    protocol litecoin
    
    worksize 256
    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well
---

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

---
    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices
            0       Pitcairn
    Program built from saved binary.
    LTC buffer size: 384MB.
            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.
---

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0
    
    mine litecoin

This would amplify any sentiment against a crypto currency like the sentiment that LTC is over-valued.  

I think this has effected bitcoin less because most fiat intended to be used to get some would be going to mtgox. I could only imagine how hard BTC would crash if mtgox where to go away.

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.

The problem with buying on Mt.Gox and sending to BTC-e is that Mt.Gox's bitcoin price is usually a few-to-several dollars higher. That means once they arrive at BTC-e, you can't sell them for what you just bought them for on Mt.Gox. You can try to minimize the loss by holding them in BTC-e until the price reaches the price you paid at Mt.Gox... but there is no guarantee it will or how long it will take.

Regardless, that is the easiest way to buy litecoins. Try to do it when the exchanges are only a dollar or two apart. When sending from Mt.Gox, make sure to pay the transaction fee so it gets processed faster (miners like fees, they take priority.) This minimizes the time spent in transit and helps you get the bitcoins in BTC-e before the price changes too much.

Once you have bitcoins in BTC-e, there are two ways to get litecoins. You can sell them for USD and use the USD to buy litecoins, or you can trade bitcoins directly for litecoins. They both will result in roughly the same amount of litecoins... but occasionally there is a big enough difference between the two to net you a couple extra litecoins. It is something you'll have to calculate yourself to see which one results in more litecoins.

As mentioned before, the biggest thing holding back litecoins right now is how difficult it is to buy them with USD. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to get USD directly to BTC-e, unless you hit the BitInstant lottery where BTC-e shows up as a Send To option. This is why Mt.Gox trading litecoins is going to be huge. It is very easy to get USD into Mt.Gox.

I said this in another comment, but it applies here too:

*The connection between expected value and the total number of coins circulated is overstated. Litecoins should not be equal to 0.25 Bitcoins just because there will be four times more Bitcoins. The value of a coin is only really tied to how much faith people put in it in general. This applies to all currencies.*

*You could consider the total value of a currency as just the total faith and the value of a single coin is just ""FAITH / COIN-TOTAL."" My arguments are just that the fundamentals of Litecoin are now strong enough that we should expect faith in Litecoin to be approximately that of what faith in Bitcoin was three months ago.

ASIC's will raise the difficulty so much, that your common miner (me and you) will be blown out of the water when it comes to mining BTC.

With all the new miners now (including new ones coming in that will start to research and find BTC is impregnable) there will be a lot of users with litecoins they want to spend. Here we will then start to see services (supply) start up to meet the new customers (demand). This in turn will start to rise the value of litecoin.

The technical advantage of a diversity of cryptocurrency systems isn't theoretical, it's proven, for instance *when Bitcoin forked recently Litecoin was fine*.  People have since then obliviously kept repeating the argument that Litecoin isn't substantially different enough to matter, but that argument *must* fall against the fact that it *did* recently actually practically matter!!  Surely there are other classes of failure/attack to which both systems are vulnerable, but *that* is what's still theoretical.  Litecoin has actually allowed cryptocurrency transactions to continue during a disruption of the Bitcoin network. 

Having a second set of currency markets is also a useful redundancy.  For instance Litecoin has recently been trading relatively steadily for $4-$5, even as that's gone from being ฿0.04 to being ฿0.02!  The LTC price is happy to diverge from the BTC price, so it allows the cryptocurrency market as a whole to be more diverse and stable.

8,t3_1bmsag,t3_1bmsag,0,,0,"cgminer might be able to get a better hashrate out of the 6xxx series, but I'll just write up a quick little guide how you would set it up in Reaper:

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

---
    host notroll.in
    port 6332
    user linkthestraw.1
    pass 12345
    
    protocol litecoin
    
    worksize 256
    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well
---

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

---
    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices
            0       Pitcairn
    Program built from saved binary.
    LTC buffer size: 384MB.
            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.
---

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0
    
    mine litecoin
---

Most people are unaware of the timeframe and there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether they even will support it (there are still many people who think it was an April Fool's joke).

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Knowing that, I don't think the news is ""priced in"" very much at all, and I expect LTC to rise significantly from wherever it is when LTC trading opens on MT.GOX before the end of the month.


Addressing your other points:

&gt; No idea how much of these LTCs are being hoarded by miners and are ready to flood the market with cheap supply. Maybe someone can give me more info as to this issue. I am new to crypto, but have traded currencies for years.

People on the Litecoin forums have been keeping track of the large wallets.  There's really only a couple dozen people with very large numbers of Litecoins.  Many of those have been bought in the last month it appears, so it doesn't seem like there are many peoeple who held onto big stacks from when they were easy to mine.

&gt; The amount of LTC to be in circulation vs BTC in circulation. Just seems like LTC/BTC should be trading lower based on this.

The reason bitcoin has gone mainstream and dramatically increased in price is because of non-technical investors buying and selling bitcoins.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a miner, but a crypto-currency can not survive on miners alone. 

We're slowly starting to make progress educating others on the concepts of bitcoin, but the average individual has absolutely no idea what the difference between scrypt and sha256 mining is, or why one would be beneficial over the other. We can barely convince them there is a need for one crypto-currency, how are we going to convince them we need two?

Also, the only reason litecoin mining is FPGA and ASIC resistant is because no one in their right mind would develop those products when they can make much more money developing sha256 hardware. They also realize that extending the life of litecoin will devalue both currencies in the long run. These products are not inconceivable, so there is no advantage for litecoin here.

If we want to bring bitcoin back to the early days of sub $1 value with little outside interest, by all means, let's make a new crypto-currency every month. (Why stop at two main currencies?) We can switch back and forth between mining 10 different currencies as difficulty peaks from one to the other(remember the early namecoin days?)

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.

You want to downloaded CGminer
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=28402.0

AFter you download that you want to use this program to make a .bat file to auto open CGminer

http://forum.litecoin.net/index.php?topic=36.0

A site most people use rightnow for LTC is https://btc-e.com - they trade USD/LTC USD/BTC BTC/LTC (ignore chat, most of the time they are just trolling or don't know what they are saying)

You need to run the miner pretty much 24/7 if you don't have a powerful machine to get any coin.

http://litecoin.org/ - is a good wallet too.

Good luck

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.

Even though I bought bitcoins at $25 and am mining them, I've made more money from litecoins (while investing less) and have switched half my miners to mining them. Litecoin mining is currently [more lucrative than bitcoin mining](http://dustcoin.com/mining)... and this will be even more so once LTC is on Mt.Gox and rises. I'm not the only one who sees this, which is why litecoin difficulty has doubled in the past week or so. PPC may end up being the best alternative mining option, but I would wait until at least next week to see where the price stabilizes. It should end up the third most valuable crypto-coin because it is different enough and Namecoin is currently mined as a byproduct of BTC mining, so there is no value from mining it. Miners put time+money into BTC, which gives it value because miners won't sell for less than what they put into it. But if you're mining BTC, NMC can be mined along side for no extra investment meaning miners give it little value.

If you buy now and LTC prices hit $10 in a month, you've more than quadrupled your money. You can't do that with bitcoins right now. PPC is a bad short term move because Vircurex will be back up tomorrow or Monday and everyone will pull their PPC out and put it on BTC-e hoping to get rich quick. The market will be flooded with cheap PPC for some time. If you're going to buy PPC, wait until next week and then hold onto it hoping Mt.Gox adds support for it also.

Mt.Gox support carries a lot of weight. People dipping their feet in the crypto-currency pool are doing it on Mt.Gox. The speculation of them adding LTC alone caused prices to more than quadruple in a couple days. But for every one person pointing out why LTC should rise over the next month or two, there are five people saying it is crashing in an attempt to buy cheap LTC themselves in anticipation of this rise. It is amazing to watch the trollbox on BTC-e and see how easy people can be manipulated. 

Anyway, that's my honest opinion. Most people who tell you to sell aren't looking out for your best interest, only theirs. Most people telling you to buy are also looking out for their best interest... it just so happens that it is your best interest too. Less people selling means less supply/more demand.

Most people are unaware of the timeframe and there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether they even will support it (there are still many people who think it was an April Fool's joke).

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Knowing that, I don't think the news is ""priced in"" very much at all, and I expect LTC to rise significantly from wherever it is when LTC trading opens on MT.GOX before the end of the month.


Addressing your other points:

&gt; No idea how much of these LTCs are being hoarded by miners and are ready to flood the market with cheap supply. Maybe someone can give me more info as to this issue. I am new to crypto, but have traded currencies for years.

People on the Litecoin forums have been keeping track of the large wallets.  There's really only a couple dozen people with very large numbers of Litecoins.  Many of those have been bought in the last month it appears, so it doesn't seem like there are many peoeple who held onto big stacks from when they were easy to mine.

&gt; The amount of LTC to be in circulation vs BTC in circulation. Just seems like LTC/BTC should be trading lower based on this.

If coin counts were the only factor, LTC/BTC would be around 0.25, which is much higher than where it is hovering at around 0.04-0.05 recently, so I don't understand your argument there.",,1431685526,True,False,Normif,11,1365013781,litecoin,c97st7j,1365014226,t1_c97st7j,0,t5_2szgd,,

But i too feel the market for Litecoin, what you can do with it as of now, the exchange and wallet systems, really do need more time to amass support and real coherence and reselience. I think mathematically it makes sense for LTC to be 4x less than BTC due to the volume difference and mining difficulty difference. And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

The only inexpensive double-spend attacks on either network are zero-confirmation attacks.  Just by having confirmations come more quickly you can be protected from those attacks 4X faster with Litecoin.  

The sorts of double-spend attacks that could be done on either network after any number of confirmations are so costly that the size of transactions they'd be trying to double spend would call for waiting for more confirmations on either network anyway.

In general, the security of the network scales with the value of the transactions occurring on it, so the risk is very low and the fact that there are more confirmations in a given period of time on the Litecoin network means that security will scale with transaction value even better.

There's a bit more risk of forks causing orphans, but basically what you see from that is a confirmation count reset before you get to six in the vast majority of cases and then a count back up to six, so no real risk if you don't accept a transaction as ""final"" until you get six confirmations.

Major bugs that require client updates would be the only likely cause of longer forks on either network and the risk is the same for those issues on either network.

Compared to bitcoin, or other SHA-2 based coins, where any entity who could drop a few million on ASICs could essentially hijack the network for much less of a cost.

This would amplify any sentiment against a crypto currency like the sentiment that LTC is over-valued.  

I think this has effected bitcoin less because most fiat intended to be used to get some would be going to mtgox. I could only imagine how hard BTC would crash if mtgox where to go away. So on the one hand litecoin being traded on mtgox will make it far more stable on the other hand it makes everyone more dependent on them and their ability to remain up and running. 

If anyone has a reason to support distributed exchanges it is people who support altcoins since they are more likely to be depended on fewer exchanges making them vulnerable to manipulation from denial of service attacks or hacks.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't feel that a mining pool reflects the situation I've just described. The clients are all - in theory - doing what they are supposed to be doing. As long as more than 50% of the nodes on the network are running the official client, it's still working as intended.

8,t3_1bmsag,t3_1bmsag,0,,0,"cgminer might be able to get a better hashrate out of the 6xxx series, but I'll just write up a quick little guide how you would set it up in Reaper:

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

---
    host notroll.in
    port 6332

    pass 12345

    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well
---

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

---
    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices
            0       Pitcairn
    Program built from saved binary.
    LTC buffer size: 384MB.
            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.
---

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0
    
    mine litecoin

13,t1_c99rjk6,t3_1bstzz,0,,0,"No I didn't first find out about bitcoins and get involved until relatively late, but didn't make the same mistake with litecoins. Even though I bought bitcoins at $25 and am mining them, I've made more money from litecoins (while investing less) and have switched half my miners to mining them. Litecoin mining is currently [more lucrative than bitcoin mining](http://dustcoin.com/mining)... and this will be even more so once LTC is on Mt.Gox and rises. I'm not the only one who sees this, which is why litecoin difficulty has doubled in the past week or so. PPC may end up being the best alternative mining option, but I would wait until at least next week to see where the price stabilizes. It should end up the third most valuable crypto-coin because it is different enough and Namecoin is currently mined as a byproduct of BTC mining, so there is no value from mining it. Miners put time+money into BTC, which gives it value because miners won't sell for less than what they put into it. But if you're mining BTC, NMC can be mined along side for no extra investment meaning miners give it little value.

If you buy now and LTC prices hit $10 in a month, you've more than quadrupled your money. You can't do that with bitcoins right now. PPC is a bad short term move because Vircurex will be back up tomorrow or Monday and everyone will pull their PPC out and put it on BTC-e hoping to get rich quick. The market will be flooded with cheap PPC for some time. If you're going to buy PPC, wait until next week and then hold onto it hoping Mt.Gox adds support for it also.

Mt.Gox support carries a lot of weight. People dipping their feet in the crypto-currency pool are doing it on Mt.Gox. The speculation of them adding LTC alone caused prices to more than quadruple in a couple days. But for every one person pointing out why LTC should rise over the next month or two, there are five people saying it is crashing in an attempt to buy cheap LTC themselves in anticipation of this rise. It is amazing to watch the trollbox on BTC-e and see how easy people can be manipulated. 

Anyway, that's my honest opinion. Most people who tell you to sell aren't looking out for your best interest, only theirs. Most people telling you to buy are also looking out for their best interest... it just so happens that it is your best interest too. Less people selling means less supply/more demand.

After learning more about it and seeing it's market saturation go way up, I strongly believe that it will develop along side bitcoin now.  

There's a lot of money in litecoin and it's extremely simple for merchants/developers to add litecoin support if they have bitcoin support.  It would be dumb to ignore all that money when it's so easy to support it.

There's also no harm in having two cryptos and the diversity adds a nice element of stability.  If there's ever another fork in BTC it's nice to have LTC as a backup for immediate trades while the chain stabilizes.

It also can potentially provide additional anonymity because you can convert your money from BTC to LTC (and vice versa).  This pushes the money out of one or the other's block chain history ensuring total anonymity.

Mt.Gox will start trading it which will drive prices way up from speculation (especially from people who felt they missed the BTC boom).  Once ASICs actually start shipping, most miners will move to LTC which will drive prices up even more.

Merchants will start accepting LTC before it can bust for good and it will grow along side BTC with long term growth.

There is a single most unintelligent assumption people make with these calculations for long-term estimates. They **don't use long-term estimates** at all.

If you really increase difficulty by 2928% per quarter, then also the price will increase to follow or lead difficulty, or both. Having bitcoin available, miners can switch back and forth to whichever is more profitable. They can also buy and sell the more profitable one, for the less profitable one, because they can see spot value and electricity costs instantly.



Your estimate should include this litecoin valuation in USD:

Week 1: 4

Week 2: 5.2

Week 3: 6.8

Week 4: 8.8

Week 5: 11.4

Week 6: 14.9

note 1: Hardware can be sold out with limited losses in case of litecoin crash. Litecoin can be sold out with complete losses in case of litecoin crash.


note 2: check the production parity between week 1 and week 13 as a quick method to speed calculations, week 1 gives 36*4.75 USD, week 13 would give the same value in 1 LTC, thus one LTC should be 171 USD to offer the same mining profitability.

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well

I find that the thread concurrency needs to be EXACT for optimum performance. If you are also using a 7870 then my thread concurrency values are likely to work for you. Like literally, to the last digit. I started with reaper but moved to cgminer with the [guiminer interface](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150331.0). Here's what i got:

For when i'm at the computer and want to interact, I get 300kh with this cgminer configuration: clock at **1150**, mem clock at **1350**, thread concurrency at **8192**, intensity **12**

I played around and found that If I increase the clock and mem clock up to 1200/1400 i get even better performance, but more prone to a gpu driver crash. Perhaps you can clock up even more. (1230/1430 got me 320kh before crashing)


Now for over night mining at 400kh I use a different config. clock at **950**, mem clock at **1450**, thread concurrency at **15232**, intensity **18**.
 I attempted this at 1000/1500 and got 420kh but the mem clock caused a crash at that level.
 

Another thing i learned is that stale/errors and pool errors can greatly reduce performance. A good pool i switched to is [http://give-me-ltc.com/](http://give-me-ltc.com/), and if you are using cgminer it has stratum support built in. Stratum makes a HUGE difference in efficient mining. All you need to do it put in the pool stratum address for the host.

Hope this helps my fellow 7870 miners! And if you have another card, find out the best thread concurrency to use... cause that is the one thing that can enhance or reduce performance, when paired with a proper clock to mem clock ratio.

8,t3_1c1sqv,t3_1c1sqv,1,,0,"I recently built a linux-based mining rig with 3x 7950s in it. I documented the process and sent it to a couple friends with zero linux experience (I know you said you're comfortable with linux, but just in case a linux newbie is interested in giving this a shot...), and they were able to get up and running in a matter of hours with their own rigs. We're getting about 620 kH/sec on each GPU with modest overclocks, which is exactly the same hashrate that I see in win7.  
  
Here is exactly what I sent to them:  

#**1) Configure BIOS settings:**

   - disable everything we're not using (audio, serial port, firewire, etc)
   - change power options to automatically start system whenever power is restored (in case power goes out while you're away, also makes it easier to power on with no switch...)
   - make sure that USB flash stick is first in boot order


#**2) Install Xubuntu desktop x64 from temporary CD drive (or another USB stick) to your USB stick**

   - get the installation image here:  http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs-Xubuntu/12.10/release/xubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso
   - use 8GB+ USB stick, partition 5500mb for root (/), 315mb for swap, and the remaining amount for home (/home)
   - make sure to check auto-login box during install
   - boot into desktop when done

   
#**3) Install AMD Catalyst drivers:**

   (open terminal)


    sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates fglrx-amdcccle-updates fglrx-updates-dev
    sudo aticonfig --lsa
    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial
    sudo reboot
   

   (after reboot, check that everything works:)
   

    sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --odgt


   (you should see all of your cards with hardware monitoring enabled)

   *Important: you will likely need to have something plugged into each video card to prevent the OS from idling it. The easiest way to do this is to make a dummy plug for each card. Instructions: 
   http://www.overclock.net/t/384733/the-30-second-dummy-plug

   If you add/remove video cards later, re-run this:   sudo aticonfig --adapter=all --initial 


#**4) Install SSH, curl, &amp; update all packages**

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server byobu
   

   (the rest can be done via SSH if you wish - make sure to forward port 22 on your firewall to the box if you want to connect from outside your network)  
   (As for an SSH client, I recommend Putty - you can copy each of the remaining commands and then right-click them into your putty window instead of typing them manually)
      

    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade



#**5) Install CGMiner:**

    wget http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/cgminer/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2
    tar jxvf cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2


   (optional - delete the archive)

    rm *.bz2


   (optional - check if cgminer detects all GPUs properly:)

    cd cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    ./cgminer -n


#**6) Create cgminer startup script:**


    nano mine_litecoins.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/sh
    export DISPLAY=:0
    export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100
    export GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    cd /home/[your xubuntu username]/cgminer-2.11.4-x86_64-built
    ./cgminer --scrypt -I 19 -g 1 -w 256 --thread-concurrency 21712 --auto-fan -o stratum+tcp://notroll.in:3333 -u [your notroll.in workername] -p 12345 --failover-only -o stratum+tcp://coinotron.com:3334 -u [your coinotron workername] -p 12345


   (save the file &amp; quit nano)


    chmod +x mine_litecoins.sh
   
   

#**7) Create auto-start scripts**


    nano miner_launcher.sh


   (enter the following into the editor:)
   

    #!/bin/bash
    DEFAULT_DELAY=0
    if [ ""x$1"" = ""x"" -o ""x$1"" = ""xnone"" ]; then
       DELAY=$DEFAULT_DELAY
    else
       DELAY=$1
    fi
    sleep $DELAY
    su [your xubuntu username] -c ""screen -dmS cgm /home/[your xubuntu username]/mine_litecoins.sh""


   (save the file &amp; quit nano)


    chmod +x miner_launcher.sh
   

   
   Add this line to /etc/rc.local :
   
    /home/[your xubuntu username]/miner_launcher.sh 30 &amp;
   

   (will need to run nano as sudo, put the line above ""exit 0"")



#**8) Create an alias to easily check on cgminer:**

    sudo nano .bashrc


scroll to the end of the file and add these lines above the line that reads ""# enable programmable completion ...""


    alias monitor_cgminer='screen -x cgm'


(note that you'll need to restart your SSH connection for this to take effect)


#**9) Management/info:**

- The miner will autostart after 30 seconds after linux is booted every time the box is powered on.
- If you want to monitor output, SSH into the box and type ""monitor_cgminer"" at any time to jump to cgminer's screen output. When you're done, hit ctrl-A, ctrl-D to leave the screen session (and leave cgminer running on the box).

Scrypt is actually a better basis algorithm (than Bitcoin's SHA256) and will make it more difficult to produce specialized FPGAs or ASICs.  This means that all of the GPU miners who find that Bitcoin is no longer profitable as difficulty rises from ASICs over the next few months will be looking to mine another cryptocoin.  Given that Litecoin is the most technically sound and widest used altcoin, it is the natural option.
It's actually good that they don't differ much otherwise.

I don't see any major flaws in either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and I think that Litecoin is using a better basis algorithm, is inheriting all of the good parts of Bitcoin, and is not messing anything up from it's parent.  I also think that it will be good for cryptocurrency long-term to have two currencies because it will improve the overall stability and safety of the system of cryptocurrencies as a whole.

I'm also very surprised that mining of Litecoins hasn't picked up even MORE rapidly than it has in the last couple of weeks as Bitcoins have risen.  Litecoin difficulty is around 90 right now, and given current exchange rates and difficulties I expect that for nearly all GPU miners they would see more profit from LTC until Litecoin difficulty is over 120.

This would amplify any sentiment against a crypto currency like the sentiment that LTC is over-valued.  

I think this has effected bitcoin less because most fiat intended to be used to get some would be going to mtgox. I could only imagine how hard BTC would crash if mtgox where to go away. So on the one hand litecoin being traded on mtgox will make it far more stable on the other hand it makes everyone more dependent on them and their ability to remain up and running. 

If anyone has a reason to support distributed exchanges it is people who support altcoins since they are more likely to be depended on fewer exchanges making them vulnerable to manipulation from denial of service attacks or hacks.

Goto [1] https://www.bitinstant.com/ choose cash deposit CVS Pay to BitCoin Address. (you can use one @ BTC-E or your wallet) I use the one at BTC-E because bitcoin wallet was taking too long syncing. go thru getting moneygram slip via zipzap.

[ BTC-E &gt; Finances &gt; BTC Make Deposit. Copy Address

Bitinstant.com &gt; Pay From CVS &gt; Pay To : BitCon Address ]

Take the zipzap printout, goto your local moneygram location and pay that slip as a bill with CASH (Cash Only, make sure you bring cash).

Drive back home, and look at email from zipap and check the information on BlockChain.org and see funds been verify yet. Once they're verify BTC-E should notify you that you have BitCoins deposited.

Click on BTC/LTC button above the graph/chart. choose buy LCT, click on your BTC balance to autofill the amount and buy.

Took me about 10 min to fill the order.

Transfer you LTC to your own wallet.

DO NOT WATCH THE CHART!!! It will just drive you crazy.

I decided to by @ 1.40 after looking for way to buy LTC without leaving house wasted a lot of time. so I end up getting them at 1.80! so don't waste time.

What other choice did Nicksasa have?  First he was clear he didn't have the proper data to reverse the double payments in a proper way.  Even if he did he can't reverse the people who already cashed out with double paid shares.  #1 Longpoll payments where double paying 2 days and 14 hours.  Stratum was double paying for 14 hours... and from what he says his database doesn't keep track if the payout was LP or Stratum.

I'm afraid Nicksasa can't mint litecoin out of his ass.  His wallet was dried up by people taking payment during the double payment window.  So it appears someone(s) with a really big hash rate noticed and cashed out before Nicksasa noticed.

I don't know much about Litecoin, but if it's anything like Bitcoin, the issue is with the clients agreeing on results. If over half of the Bitcoin clients on the network were somehow compromised and now were running different code than the official client, they would now become authoritative and the results of the compromised clients would become the actual, definitive results.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't feel that a mining pool reflects the situation I've just described. The clients are all - in theory - doing what they are supposed to be doing. As long as more than 50% of the nodes on the network are running the official client, it's still working as intended.

2,t1_c99ubd6,t3_1bt5eq,0,,0,"You can buy partial bitcoins on exchanges... even very small fractions of bitcoins.

The problem with buying on Mt.Gox and sending to BTC-e is that Mt.Gox's bitcoin price is usually a few-to-several dollars higher. That means once they arrive at BTC-e, you can't sell them for what you just bought them for on Mt.Gox. You can try to minimize the loss by holding them in BTC-e until the price reaches the price you paid at Mt.Gox... but there is no guarantee it will or how long it will take.

Regardless, that is the easiest way to buy litecoins. Try to do it when the exchanges are only a dollar or two apart. When sending from Mt.Gox, make sure to pay the transaction fee so it gets processed faster (miners like fees, they take priority.) This minimizes the time spent in transit and helps you get the bitcoins in BTC-e before the price changes too much.

Once you have bitcoins in BTC-e, there are two ways to get litecoins. You can sell them for USD and use the USD to buy litecoins, or you can trade bitcoins directly for litecoins. They both will result in roughly the same amount of litecoins... but occasionally there is a big enough difference between the two to net you a couple extra litecoins. It is something you'll have to calculate yourself to see which one results in more litecoins.

As mentioned before, the biggest thing holding back litecoins right now is how difficult it is to buy them with USD. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to get USD directly to BTC-e, unless you hit the BitInstant lottery where BTC-e shows up as a Send To option. This is why Mt.Gox trading litecoins is going to be huge. It is very easy to get USD into Mt.Gox. BTC-e needs to work on adding more USD deposit options or it is going to lose out on a lot of trading fees.",,1431648316,True,False,milone,2,1365293842,litecoin,c99ydxp,False,t1_c99ydxp,0,t5_2szgd,,

Most people are unaware of the timeframe and there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether they even will support it (there are still many people who think it was an April Fool's joke).

Consider too all these factors when evaluating whether the MT.GOX news is ""priced in"":

* The only people trading now are those willing to deal with BTC-e.com.  Many refuse and say ""I'll wait for MT.GOX""

* The only people trading now are those who were already tuned into LTC enough to hear about MT.GOX being rumored to adopt LTC within a couple of days

* There are many BTC traders who haven't even heard of LTC and will learn about it only after they see it show up on MT.GOX.  

Supposedly just the identity verification queue at MT.GOX is still over 25,000 people long.  These are all new traders who heard about Bitcoin through mainstream media in the last couple of weeks.  These are all people who will likely buy into LTC too when it shows up on GOX.

Knowing that, I don't think the news is ""priced in"" very much at all, and I expect LTC to rise significantly from wherever it is when LTC trading opens on MT.GOX before the end of the month.


Addressing your other points:

&gt; No idea how much of these LTCs are being hoarded by miners and are ready to flood the market with cheap supply. Maybe someone can give me more info as to this issue. I am new to crypto, but have traded currencies for years.

People on the Litecoin forums have been keeping track of the large wallets.  There's really only a couple dozen people with very large numbers of Litecoins.  Many of those have been bought in the last month it appears, so it doesn't seem like there are many peoeple who held onto big stacks from when they were easy to mine.

&gt; The amount of LTC to be in circulation vs BTC in circulation. Just seems like LTC/BTC should be trading lower based on this.

The problem with buying on Mt.Gox and sending to BTC-e is that Mt.Gox's bitcoin price is usually a few-to-several dollars higher. That means once they arrive at BTC-e, you can't sell them for what you just bought them for on Mt.Gox. You can try to minimize the loss by holding them in BTC-e until the price reaches the price you paid at Mt.Gox... but there is no guarantee it will or how long it will take.

Regardless, that is the easiest way to buy litecoins. Try to do it when the exchanges are only a dollar or two apart. When sending from Mt.Gox, make sure to pay the transaction fee so it gets processed faster (miners like fees, they take priority.) This minimizes the time spent in transit and helps you get the bitcoins in BTC-e before the price changes too much.

Once you have bitcoins in BTC-e, there are two ways to get litecoins. You can sell them for USD and use the USD to buy litecoins, or you can trade bitcoins directly for litecoins. They both will result in roughly the same amount of litecoins... but occasionally there is a big enough difference between the two to net you a couple extra litecoins. It is something you'll have to calculate yourself to see which one results in more litecoins.

As mentioned before, the biggest thing holding back litecoins right now is how difficult it is to buy them with USD. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to get USD directly to BTC-e, unless you hit the BitInstant lottery where BTC-e shows up as a Send To option. This is why Mt.Gox trading litecoins is going to be huge. It is very easy to get USD into Mt.Gox.

Third, I think that Litecoin is actually more succesful for not trying to reinvent the wheel away from the strong foundations of Bitcoin.  LTC only has a few changes from BTC, and that will make it easier for market tools to be made universal while also easing the learning curve and providing confidence to those who already trust in BTC.

The technical advantage of a diversity of cryptocurrency systems isn't theoretical, it's proven, for instance *when Bitcoin forked recently Litecoin was fine*.

Surely there are other classes of failure/attack to which both systems are vulnerable, but *that* is what's still theoretical.  Litecoin has actually allowed cryptocurrency transactions to continue during a disruption of the Bitcoin network. 

Having a second set of currency markets is also a useful redundancy.

I have to admit, I love the faster block speeds and that is a huge selling point for litecoin.  Bitoin is also begining to have difficulty with the number of transactions that can fit in a block.  Litecoin already is better suited for this.  If most merchants are just using cryptocurrencies to covert to USD right away, what difference does it make to them?  Here is a video of a bar that does just that, and they probally use Mt. Gox's API's  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm6aM8mIQSs

And I hope BTC/LTC can grow together to bring more decentralized markets to the forefront. 

Question?
Im not sure what the terracoin difficulty is for mining but it is designed to create only 42 million coins. This pattern makes sense and seems tidy (btc-21million-trc-42million-ltc-84million). Do you have any thoughts on TRC finding a place in this due to its volume limit (scarcity) nature? (which it seems some other trending crypto's do not have a volume limit?). Im not sure how TRC mining works relative to the others or much about mining at all, but the volume aspect seems to be a parallel with the three i thought worth bringing up. I guess TRC could be worth less than LTC if mining TRC is input intensive....
Thoughts? I know TRC hasnt been up to much (besides a lil spike upwards today) and i dont know of anybody or anything that accepts TRC as payment.
But it sounds like could be a powerful Trifecta.

If you just look at the volume of trade in the last couple of weeks you can see that over half the Litecoins currently in existence have exchanged hands in that time.  This says that most of the early holders are already gone and people holding them now have paid on average more than $1 for each.  That's far from a blackhole and far above anything any other coin than Bitcoin has done before or after Litecoin.  Litecoin has risen above the pack on its merits and will continue to do so.

I am pretty new to the whole mining scene, but will attempt to answer your question to the best of my current ability. 

1)A wallet is exactly that, a storage device for your currency in this case Litecoins. Using the Litecoin-QT wallet it is easy to create a secure key to encrypt your wallet from the drop down menu. One thing to consider is there are two types of wallets. The first is a local wallet stored on the computer you are mining on. The other is an online wallet(the type that most pools use). From what I gather best practice seems to be, to set your pool wallet to automatically transfer funds from your pool wallet to your local wallet. 

2) In order to setup solo mining, you will need to basically run your litecoin-qt as a server which the mining software will use to connect to the litecoin server. So when/if you solve a block your litecoins will be deposited into the wallet you are using to mine with. Are you set on solo mining? After doing some research and trying solo mining, it seems to me that pool mining offers almost identical payout in the long run. The major benefit though is that pool mining starts making currency the second you start mining, assuming that you use a PPS pool. Only downside to pool mining is the fee associated with withdrawing currency from the pool to your wallet.

**Total of 146 LTC** At future correlated rate of 93.2 USD that is about **13607 USD**


**Result: Buy all the mining hardware today!**


note 1: Hardware can be sold out with limited losses in case of litecoin crash. Litecoin can be sold out with complete losses in case of litecoin crash.


note 2: check the production parity between week 1 and week 13 as a quick method to speed calculations, week 1 gives 36*4.75 USD, week 13 would give the same value in 1 LTC, thus one LTC should be 171 USD to offer the same mining profitability.

In 15 minutes you can be fairly well assured your transaction is finalized in the network, compared to an hour for Bitcoin.  For ecommerce applications, this is a vital point.  Green addresses can help, but not everyone will want to use them or know which to really trust.

Litecoin offers a directly integrated means of providing fast trust in arbitrary transactions by not aiming to make it possible for interstellar commerce to occur over the protocol (which would be the only real need for such a long block target).

You're also wrong that scrypt provides no protection from ASICs.  The author of the algorithm specifically created it as a means of protecting against ASIC attacks.

And you can't move Bitcoin ASICs to scrypt mining, so Litecoin won't hurt the mining rate of the Bitcoin network at all.  On the contrary, Litecoin will take advantage of all of the displaced GPUs which would have no reason to mine Bitcoin anyway and provide a means of allowing them to continue securing the network.  Litecoin will offer redundancy to the Bitcoin network when services integrate support for both.

Bitcoin's and Litecoin's improvements can work in tandem.  Again, other cryptocoins created before and after Litecoin have failed while Litecoin continues gathering momentum, so there's really little risk of arbitrary chains gaining hold and hurting the platform.  People have more sense than that.  Litecoin is surviving and thriving on its merits while other coins falter and die for their lack of them.

My guess is that since their local fait is so crumby, and BTC is so expensive LTC is seen as a good bet. Especially since it has the potential to rocket up a few dollars once Gox includes support. 

Furthermore.... LTC mining has a lower entry cost and is considered by some to be more profitable than BTC mining. 

Im not sure why its just the Ruskys with a high interest in the Litecoin,.. You'd think everyone would have some interest.

8,t3_1bmsag,t3_1bmsag,0,,0,"cgminer might be able to get a better hashrate out of the 6xxx series, but I'll just write up a quick little guide how you would set it up in Reaper:

Step 1. Download [Reaper v13 Beta4](http://wiki.solidcoin.info/wiki/Reaper).

Step 2. Extract in a folder somewhere.

Step 3. In the folder, locate the file 'litecoin.conf' and open it with notepad. In this file you have to put your pool info and miner settings.

You can find your miner login and password in the 'Home' tab on notroll.in after creating an account.

Here's my setup for a 7850 (with aggression 12 so I can use my pc while mining). Just copy the upper part and change the login info. It is important that you leave out the http:// - otherwise it won't be able to connect. The lower part is where you set up your card.

---
    host notroll.in
    port 6332
    user linkthestraw.1
    pass 12345
    
    protocol litecoin
    
    worksize 256
    aggression 12
    threads_per_gpu 1
    sharethreads 18
    lookup_gap 2
    gpu_thread_concurrency 6144
---

You can either [check this list](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison#wiki-ATI_AMD_GPUs) and see how other people have set it up, play with the settings a bit, or just search google, eventually you will find a config which will give you a good hash rate.

Step 4. Locate the file 'reaper.conf' in the same folder.

By default it will try to mine bitcoin and solidcoin as well. To prevent this you have to remove 2 lines, so open it up in notepad:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    
    mine bitcoin &lt;- remove this
    mine litecoin
    mine solidcoin &lt;- and this as well
---

Step 5.
When you start up reaper it gives a bunch of information.

This is what it looks like at me with CPU mining enabled.

---
    List of platforms:    
            0       AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing
    Using platform number 0
    
    Using all devices
            0       Pitcairn
    Program built from saved binary.
    LTC buffer size: 384MB.
            1       Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
    Program built from saved binary.
---

To prevent reaper from CPU mining, simply add 'device x' to reaper.conf, where x is the number corresponding to your graphics card. In most cases the graphics card is number 0.

The file will end up looking like this:

---
    kernel reaper.cl
    save_binaries yes
    enable_graceful_shutdown no
    long_polling yes
    device 0
    
    mine litecoin

I don't know much about Litecoin, but if it's anything like Bitcoin, the issue is with the clients agreeing on results. If over half of the Bitcoin clients on the network were somehow compromised and now were running different code than the official client, they would now become authoritative and the results of the compromised clients would become the actual, definitive results.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't feel that a mining pool reflects the situation I've just described. The clients are all - in theory - doing what they are supposed to be doing. As long as more than 50% of the nodes on the network are running the official client, it's still working as intended.

Contrast that to Litecoin where it was designed with an algorithm that was created specifically to avoid allowing more efficient hardware to be created.  That means your GPUs can mine fairly with other GPUs and your profits can stay high enough to make it worthwhile.

Drive back home, and look at email from zipap and check the information on BlockChain.org and see funds been verify yet. Once they're verify BTC-E should notify you that you have BitCoins deposited.

Click on BTC/LTC button above the graph/chart. choose buy LCT, click on your BTC balance to autofill the amount and buy.

Transfer you LTC to your own wallet.

You want to downloaded CGminer

AFter you download that you want to use this program to make a .bat file to auto open CGminer

http://forum.litecoin.net/index.php?topic=36.0

A site most people use rightnow for LTC is https://btc-e.com - they trade USD/LTC USD/BTC BTC/LTC (ignore chat, most of the time they are just trolling or don't know what they are saying)

You need to run the miner pretty much 24/7 if you don't have a powerful machine to get any coin.

http://litecoin.org/ - is a good wallet too.

Litecoin offers a directly integrated means of providing fast trust in arbitrary transactions by not aiming to make it possible for interstellar commerce to occur over the protocol (which would be the only real need for such a long block target).

You're also wrong that scrypt provides no protection from ASICs.  The author of the algorithm specifically created it as a means of protecting against ASIC attacks.

And you can't move Bitcoin ASICs to scrypt mining, so Litecoin won't hurt the mining rate of the Bitcoin network at all.  On the contrary, Litecoin will take advantage of all of the displaced GPUs which would have no reason to mine Bitcoin anyway and provide a means of allowing them to continue securing the network.  Litecoin will offer redundancy to the Bitcoin network when services integrate support for both.

Bitcoin's and Litecoin's improvements can work in tandem.  Again, other cryptocoins created before and after Litecoin have failed while Litecoin continues gathering momentum, so there's really little risk of arbitrary chains gaining hold and hurting the platform.  People have more sense than that.  Litecoin is surviving and thriving on its merits while other coins falter and die for their lack of them.

You're worried too much that the concept and promise of P2P cryptocurrency is at threat by the thought of competition in the space.

In practice, this was not the case, as GPUs have overrun the Litecoin network. While it will be more expensive to develop an ASIC for Litecoin mining, it is certainly not impossible.

This would amplify any sentiment against a crypto currency like the sentiment that LTC is over-valued.  

I think this has effected bitcoin less because most fiat intended to be used to get some would be going to mtgox. I could only imagine how hard BTC would crash if mtgox where to go away.

AFter you download that you want to use this program to make a .bat file to auto open CGminer

A site most people use rightnow for LTC is https://btc-e.com - they trade USD/LTC USD/BTC BTC/LTC (ignore chat, most of the time they are just trolling or don't know what they are saying)

You need to run the miner pretty much 24/7 if you don't have a powerful machine to get any coin.

http://litecoin.org/ - is a good wallet too.

There's a lot of money in litecoin and it's extremely simple for merchants/developers to add litecoin support if they have bitcoin support.  It would be dumb to ignore all that money when it's so easy to support it.

There's also no harm in having two cryptos and the diversity adds a nice element of stability.  If there's ever another fork in BTC it's nice to have LTC as a backup for immediate trades while the chain stabilizes.

It also can potentially provide additional anonymity because you can convert your money from BTC to LTC (and vice versa).  This pushes the money out of one or the other's block chain history ensuring total anonymity.

Mt.Gox will start trading it which will drive prices way up from speculation (especially from people who felt they missed the BTC boom).  Once ASICs actually start shipping, most miners will move to LTC which will drive prices up even more.

I've read at a number of places that ASICs do not have benefits from Litecoin mining, since the mining algorithm is different from that of Bitcoins.

This means that Litecoin will actually benefit from the gains Bitcoin makes and reach a value that's a larger fraction of a Bitcoin than it currently is.  From the indicators I follow and the general niche I expect Litecoin to fill, I see that value being about 10 litecoins per bitcoin before the end of the year.  I covered a bit about this in an earlier topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1bpml0/litecoin_4x_undervalued_at_4/

In terms of why Litecoin should get there: it is mostly because Litecoin is the natural place for all existing Bitcoin miners to go as ASICs overtake the Bitcoin network.  It is also because Litecoin transactions can be finalized  four times quicker than Bitcoin payments.  This will make them practically more convenient than Bitcoin for many sorts of transactions.

Litecoins will also be accepted nearly everywhere Bitcoins are (BitPay plans to make Litecoin payments available everywhere that merchants use their service, for instance).

They will also be even easier to get: everyone will be able to mine them efficiently without specialized hardware (especially important to countries which cannot import the ASICs) and all of the same means of acquiring Bitcoins will be available to acquire Litecoins.
