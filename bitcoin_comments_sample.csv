t3_h36b0,0,1,1,"&gt; i think the main weakness of bitcoin is it's lack of scalability

There is no scalability problem. As the number of transactions increases, so too does the financial reward for solving a block.

Once blocks get sufficiently large, most desktop clients will begin to use the simplified payment verification method, instead of verifying the full block chain. The task of verifying the block chain would fall to supernodes.

&gt; Solutions with supernodes should explain how supernodes are harmless

There is no difference between a normal client in the bitcoin network today, and a supernode in a theoretically much larger bitcoin network.

It's important to realise that there wouldn't just be a handful of supernodes; there'd be hundreds of thousands. Transaction fees would ensure that anyone with sufficient hardware and bandwidth could turn a profit by running a supernode.

Theoretically, the network could be compromised if an attacker had access to over 50% of the supernodes, but the larger the bitcoin economy, the more money would be required to do that. By the time the bitcoin network has to handle 20ktps (assuming that ever happens), the economy will be so large that it would be extremely difficult for any one entity to find enough computing power to compromise the network. It would be even more difficult for an attacker to hide the fact that they control the majority of the bitcoin network.

Sure. You could set up a P2P network where each peer broadcasts a bitcoin address. You pick an address at random, and then send a small amount (say, 0.10 BTC). If the peer is honest, they will send you back an equivalent amount, but paid using coins with a different transaction history. If you keep repeating these steps, all the coins in the network will be completely mixed up.

You'd probably need some additional mechanism to discourage dishonest peers; ones that would take the money and run.

t3_fpt30,0,8,8,"well, for one, the bitcoin client only does CPU-based mining. If you have video card that is less than 3/4 years old, that's a few order of magnitude slower than what you'd get with a GPU miner.

Another neat side of GPU mining is that it leaves your CPU idle, and is designed to yield to other GPU-using stuff politely, so you can keep it running 24/7 while watching videos/gaming/whatever and not have to care too much. (some games may seem choppier under some conditions. you can always stop mining during your gaming session.)

if you check the forums on bitcoin.org, there should be a bunch of threads about GPU mining, including links to various miners you can download.

Miners run side-by-side with the bitcoin client (or in the case of a mining pool (like [Slush's pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/), standalone but chatting with the pooling server very regularly)

If nothing else, playing with GPU mining helped me realize the insane computing power my so-called video card contains (my oldish ATI 5770 can do a solid single-precision TeraFLOPS, which kinda blows my mind. In bitcoin terms, it computes 160 Mhash/s, where each hash consists of almost 2 full SHA-256 runs so that's over 300 million SHA-256/s. So that's kinda cool, and it keeps doing the regular video stuff while computing all that.)

As an aside, I'm still mining with my little 5770 as part of a pool. at the beginning of the year, I was getting 8 BTC a day. nowadays, it's closer to 3 BTC a day. My GPU consumes 280 Watts, running 24/7, that's ~ 6.7 kWh. My power company charges $0.052/kWh, so that means my 3 BTC/day cost about $0.35. At current rates, it's still worth doing. Hell, I just realized I'm basically mining enough BTCs to cover my entire electric bills so far.

So that's my little take on the whole ""mining ain't profitable"" concept. I'm really not doing it for the money, it's just something fun to waste GPU cycles on.

t3_hftn3,0,0,0,"&gt; it seems like the 15 million other BitCoins could be discovered in a decade or so.

This will only happen if the computing power keeps grows rapidly indefinitely. It's not about how much computer power there is, just about how fast it's growing.

Here are the numbers:

Every 2 weeks the difficulty resets so that a new block is made every 10 minutes. So if a new block is being made every, say, 8 minutes, then there is 25% more computing power mining coins than there was two weeks ago. This only lasts until the difficulty reset (which is every 2 weeks).

Let's assume the computing power quadruples every year (really generous assumption). This means that at the end of every two week period there is 5% more computing power than there was at the beginning of the two week period. So blocks could be minted up to 5% faster than planned.

The 18 million bitcoins point is planned for 2020, so it might happen in 2019 instead of 2020.

&gt; For people who don't know a ton about FPGA stuff, you can run a hash engine natively in hardware using a hew hundred gates at most for MD5, and run one hash per clock cycle, with a clock speed of 5-550 Mhz.  Most of these chips have anywhere from 2000 gates for the barest of bare bones $50 DIY kits to about 9 million on the latest Virtex 7. 
Assuming the hash engine took 350 gates (2 orders of magnitude reliable), the chip runs at 550 MHz, and has 9 million gates, and was just 20% efficient, that is 80% of the time the chip is waiting for data or or otherwise not hashing, you could see about 2.8 trillion hashes per second.  TRILLION HASHES PER SECOND.  Even using worst case figures, a 5 million gate device at 250 Mhz, 5000 gates per hash engine, and a 5% utilization factor, you still get 50 Gh/sec, over 200 times the hash calculating power of a Ati Radeon 5850.

Will the exchanger keep track of its transactions and report them to the IRS?

Will it permanently destroy all records of those transactions as they happen?

Unless I'm sure it's the latter, I can be reasonably confident that the IRS will know about it eventually.

From my standpoint, I don't have any strong ideological reasons to avoid paying taxes in the first place. One potential problem however is that I'm not sure which rule would apply. A first guesstimate would be to go with capital gains, similar to profits on stock sales. But forex transactions actually get significantly better tax rates, so using those rules would be better, but it's not obvious that they'd apply.

Once businesses are able to pay for at least some of their costs with bitcoin, they can price goods in bitcoin primarily which will remove (I believe) a lot of the price volatility.

Also, it's not a requirement of Bitcoin that your private keys (the only thing **you** need to keep available and secure) are stored on a personal computer. There is at least one member of the community working on a secure hardware device that stores keys and does the signing - the keys are never shared with an untrusted device.

Bitcoin is not flawless, but it has the advantage of an enthusiastic and rapidly growing community supporting it. As time goes on, and more and more nodes and computing power back up the network, and more and more savy programmers scrutinize the code, the flaws should be minimized to the point where it is superior to any competing currency, all of which have flaws of their own.

As far as I can tell, the key feature of bitcoin is the use of *proof of work* to prevent double spending. This in turn relies on cryptographic techniques which create asymmetry or irreversibility. These features tie bitcoins to the physical world laws of energy (proof of work) and thermodynamics (irreversibility), which together give bitcoins their scarcity. 

Usually, the realm of pure information is immune to the limitations of the physical world, and data can be copied *ad infinitum*. Too bad the physical world does not also have such unlimited abundance; then we wouldn't need money. It was quite a clever trick to port the scarcity of the physical world into the info world.

Technical details: Your wallet file is a pool of N private keys (default 100).

This will only happen if the computing power keeps grows rapidly indefinitely. It's not about how much computer power there is, just about how fast it's growing.

Here are the numbers:

Every 2 weeks the difficulty resets so that a new block is made every 10 minutes. So if a new block is being made every, say, 8 minutes, then there is 25% more computing power mining coins than there was two weeks ago. This only lasts until the difficulty reset (which is every 2 weeks).

Let's assume the computing power quadruples every year (really generous assumption). This means that at the end of every two week period there is 5% more computing power than there was at the beginning of the two week period. So blocks could be minted up to 5% faster than planned.

The 18 million bitcoins point is planned for 2020, so it might happen in 2019 instead of 2020.

The question I have is... how would the network even know the coins are lost?!? And, for that matter, how would anyone know this to make all other bitcoins more valuable?

Correct me if I am wrong... but I take the stand to say that some kind of ""keep-alive"" signal could be implemented. If the owner can access the coins, it should be able to, for example, update a timestamp on its last transaction to prove they are not lost. If this keep-alive is not updated for a reasonable human lifetime period (say, 60 or 80 years), then they could be officially considered lost and the last owner invalidated. Invalid lost coins could return the the market and people could still find them again in the form of mining.

t3_gdkbg,0,1,1,"&gt; If many nodes are taken offline for a short period, the generation difficulty remains the same, and the attacker doesn't get anything. The network will produce fewer blocks per hour, so reversing a transaction with 6 confirmations will take a very long time. Generators don't compete with each other.

I understand that generation (mining) isn't impacted, I'm curious about verification and the attacker's advantage. If a sustained event kept ""real"" clients off the network (say, erroring out) is there some threshold that can be passed after which they will not have the resources to go back and recompute all the havoc that the evil clients have done?

E.g. an attacker controls E nodes on the network. The DoS happens and removes all but E+(E-1) nodes from the network, so the attacker is now ""in control"". Is there a threshold after which the E nodes could outcompute verifications faster than the (E-1) ""real"" nodes, get those false verifications into Merkle Hashes so they are now ""solved"", and then slowly allow ""real"" nodes to rejoin the network?

Essentially, I'm curious if an early event disrupting the verification of transactions will have a cascading effect, even after E+1 nodes rejoin the network outside of the attacker's control. 

EDIT: I see from the link you posted that the Bitcoin source code contains a block hash that ""[locks in](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Generate_valid_blocks_with_a_lower_difficulty_than_normal)"" all previous transactions. It seems significantly skilled attacker could wreak some serious havoc if they managed to both gain the 50% threshold AND compromise the main client github to change the hash to something they generated during their power trip. 

""Every few releases of Bitcoin, a recent block hash is hardcoded into the source code. Any blocks before that point can't be changed. An attacker starting at that point would have to reduce the difficulty, but this would require him to generate blocks at a much slower rate than once per 10 minutes. By the time he finally gets to a difficulty of 1, a new version of Bitcoin with an updated hardcoded block will probably have been released.""

&gt; What is about the fees you could set, I mean, yes, your ""information"" will be faster transmitted (proofed) but who will get the money? Random?

The fees go to whoever mines the block which contains your transaction. You don't have any control over it so yes, it is essentially random. By the way, transactions can't go any faster than about 10 minutes, regardless of fees. So usually offering fees will not make your transaction transmit faster.

&gt; You could not transmit a message with the ""money"" you send (as far as I know) but whats about adding a simple ""server"" to the Bitcoin client, like sendmail. So, at least an address could be associated with the money received ... (Would make webshops easier imho)

What? You mean a human-readable address instead of the current format?

Using the mtgox API you can transfer your bitcoins to USD the moment you receive them.

Even if it isn't illegal today, those in power will likely change the rules to protect their unearned privileges.  Not just with regard to bitcoins, but any public behavior that they find threatening.

So you make careful mental distinctions between your morality and the law and identify your own capacity for risk so that you can manage the changing landscape in a way that you feel at peace with.  

For instance we have the Constitutional right to engage in peaceful assembly, but obviously those in power find that very threatening - hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on Operation Earnest Voice whose sole purpose is to disrupt our online congress with sock puppet posters. If they change the rules so that speech is no longer free, will you still believe in free speech?  Will you still engage in the open expression of ideas that the state finds unsavory?  To the point of tear gas?  To the point of arrest?

Money is the means by which we hold the value of our efforts for a future date.  The people that we have entrusted with the stewardship of currency are stealing from the savers to fund their high living.  If they tell you tomorrow that you must use dollars - that you must allow them to steal from you - will you regard bitcoins and gold as morally wrong?  If not, will you risk storing your effort in some medium of exchange other than dollars?  If so what percentage?

I strongly disagree with this.

If nobody has suggested a viable solution yet it suggests that the problem is at least nontrivial. As such, it is negligent to wait for it to grow before putting serious effort into investigating solutions. For a currency to be stable people need to have confidence in it, and unresolved issues like this will undermine that.

Additionally, people often represent large changes to the fundamental implementation of BitCoin as something that's doable without too much effort. I read talk of having multiple networks interoperating as people transition from one system to the next. This strikes me as another issue which isn't being dealt with in sufficient depth. Although such as thing is certainly technically possible, there are possible problems, such as a lack of use on the old network causing the available computing power to drop significantly; I'm not knowledgeable enough to discuss the consequences this could have, but it seems like it could cause problems. I also think that such a change is the sort of thing that would confuse or worry enough people to damage confidence in BitCoin.

For most people pooled mining has a higher expected value or higher long term payout.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Why_pooled_mining

Pooled mining makes sense when you account for changing difficulty. If you mine with a CPU or slow video card you should join a pool.

Because the difficulty rises about 2% per day, the correct model is a Poisson process where the rate is exponential decaying. You want to get paid as often as possible while the difficulty is increasing. 

If the difficulty were to stop increasing then it doesn't make any sense to be in a pool.

Lastly, the pools are all charing less than 3% and several are 1% or less.

------------------
[I'm wrong here as shadow dust pointed out. My apologies] 

The expected values are indeed the same. But for most people solo mining has a ~95% of never generating anything and pooled mining is virtually guaranteed to give you the EV - 0-3% depending on the pool.

t3_h8t42,0,12,12,"&gt;It is true that banks use the same cryptography algorithms for security, however they are able to change them relatively easily if some flaw is found. Can the same be said for a decentralised network like Bitcoin?

Banks could indeed change their cryptographic algorithms, but it would take some effort from their part. Similarely, Bitcoin could change the cryptographic algorithms, but it would take some effort, even a bit more complicated than the banking example because the whole community (or a big majority) would have to agree.

I spect more competing currencies to appear so different solutions to this problem could be implemented and you could choose the one you prefered.

&gt;Once a security flaw is found in the system, how would a ""fix"" be applied?

Its a decentralized network, therefore the clients that have the most mining power is the protocol that ""wins"". Therefore if a flaw is found and a new client is released with the flaw fixed, the community would have to start using the new client.

This is actually simpler than it sounds. At the begining there were bugs found and people actualized the client without too much problem for the network.

2) Small set of people own large amounts of BTC, which again, would be hard to sell goods.

Keep in mind the hashing isn't just a way to hand out bitcoins, it's also keeping the system itself working.  

From many comments I've read, most people are already at the point where the energy costs exceed or equal the payout.  Eventually bitcoin amounts will be smaller and farther between, and those who have the winning hash will earn more from transaction fees than from the bitcoin generation.

I'm not sure why the khash varies so much, mine stays pretty consistently +/- 10% when I watch it.

Yes, the money supply is an important factor, but it is not the sole driving factor for inflation or deflation. It's just one of many pressures acting on the currency's value. For example, as there are more competing currencies, worries, etc, the perceived value can change independent of the actual supply. If people truly see that the money is being hoarded, new merchants will avoid the currency in favor of others, thus lowering its value for transactions, thus requiring people to spend it in order to avoid their wealth losing value when people start dodging the currency. A wildly overpriced currency is a danger to all of its actual value and it absolutely should compel hoarders to bail before it implodes (thus loosening and spreading the wealth). I think we're seeing that currently with the latest prices.

Deflation is not a problem, so long as the deflation is predictable.  In fact deflation encourages people to hold BitCoins instead of investing.

The only thing that measures marginal utility somewhat is money, and that measure shows us that people have a time preference for later just as well given equal amounts.

Sure, if you mentally ""calculate"" all the environmental variables so as to point that the marginal utility is ""equal"" and thus prove that the time preference for a specific marginal utility is on ""now"", you can theoretically make everything sounds plausible. But it's all a theoretical construct. You can't prove anything of what you suggest and just assert it because it sounds correct. It's not scientific at all and I am loathe to accept such an argument, given how flawed human edifices of pure logic are.

What we can empirically observe is that humans purchase various things, while others save money, and on occassion some pay in order to save money. You can't just declare what the motives of those purchases and savings are by asserting the premise of time preference because you're begging the question. First you need to prove time preference.

t3_hfv4a,0,7,7,"See, lets analyze the current system (fiat money). The money you're holding constantly lose value and thus force you to spend them fast. Saving is hard. This is the reason why you can't retire early and you have to work for your entire life if you're a common folk like I am.

In fiat money based economy, the economy grows, but resources are used very rapidly and people are over-spending, over-consuming. It's not surprising that the earth is getting more and more polluted and western countries go more and more in dept.

The only way to ""go forward"" in such economy for normal man is borrowing money. This makes most of the people economical slaves. Sure, you can buy shiny things in big quantities (things that other slaves produced), but you have to work almost whole life and give big share to what you earn to rich people ruling the system.


All the rich people controlling (actually having big influence on; no big conspiracy implied) the world are interested is keeping you and me in a hamster circle. You work, work, work, economy grows, economists are happy. There are many reasons for this: because country can have bigger armies, because economists believe it's good (all that modern economists are interested in is the entire market output), because politics and bankers have greater influence on everything in such system.

Also -- please note how ofter the argument is ""deflation is bad for debtors"". But why they have to be any debtors in the first place? Can't people just work and save like it used to be? You see -- ""people ruling the word"" are more or less kind of bankers. And they want you to want to be a debtor, because this secures their income at your cost.

Have you ever wondered why, despite all this economic growth there are still so many poor people, the rich are getting richer, even people that are doing well can't just work like ... one day in a week because they have already secured their future? Why we can spend so much on shiny shit, while whole countries are starving elsewhere? Where does the deforestation, pollution, etc. come from?

It's all because of overspending. And the fiat money is the reason. Yes, the economy grows with fiat money, but is it really the only thing we're interested in?

Let's see how it looks in deflationary economy.

First thing, you always have to buy some stuff. You want to eat? You have to buy it and the fact that tomorrow it will be 1% cheaper is not a big argument when you're hungry. If you require medical attention, you're not going to wait. You want to have your car repaired, you have to pay now or walk until you decide it's worth it. You can read this book next month, when it will be 10% ""cheaper"", but do you really want to wait?

Yes, people will spend less. You're not going to buy new TV just because new one is 3'' bigger and company creating TVs will not be able to do such large profts. But the fact that you didn't bought something is a good thing because someone else can use resources you didn't consumed to do something useful. And rise in value of your savings is a reward for patience. Thanks to you not consuming, economy grows, so grows the value of your savings.

In the price deflationary economy there are no banks (like we known today). They are not needed. If you want to invest, you just save from your work, postpone consumption and buy stuff you need for your investment cheaply (because other people didn't used them to create, buy and consume shiny toys). You don't need to get credit for your startup or business. You can work more, consume less and slowly but steady accumulate capital to invest. So there debts is not as wildly use in such economy.

The businesses in such economy are not like we see today. Companies are producing stuff that people really need and are willing to buy not because they have nothing else to spend their money on, but because it's really worth it. The economy is much, much smaller, but more lightweight for the environment. It grows slower, but in more ""we-need"" than ""we-desire"" way. People are consuming less, but can spend more time on things they're willing to do, or educating, reading, creating art or just giving their life a real meaning instead of attending ""whole-life-8h-per-day-race for consumption.

t3_gz79a,0,2,2,"&gt; Relying on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

There is also a compromise solution -- you would hold your bitcoins in a private crypto wallet, but transfer a portion of them to a clearing house to do small scale transactions.

The only thing that measures marginal utility somewhat is money, and that measure shows us that people have a time preference for later just as well given equal amounts.

Sure, if you mentally ""calculate"" all the environmental variables so as to point that the marginal utility is ""equal"" and thus prove that the time preference for a specific marginal utility is on ""now"", you can theoretically make everything sounds plausible. But it's all a theoretical construct. You can't prove anything of what you suggest and just assert it because it sounds correct. It's not scientific at all and I am loathe to accept such an argument, given how flawed human edifices of pure logic are.

What we can empirically observe is that humans purchase various things, while others save money, and on occassion some pay in order to save money. You can't just declare what the motives of those purchases and savings are by asserting the premise of time preference because you're begging the question. First you need to prove time preference.

&gt;Me too.

You're talking about something that defines all humans, not something that is likely a high percentage of a subgroup of humans might do.

The more people lose their wallets (effectively removing those coins from the economy), the more the real value of Bitcoin increases for people who can manage not to misplace them.

You can picture it like this: imagine for the sake of simplicity that the US cuts off all contact with rest of the world, and the only currency available is USD. Now image the mints all shut down. Over time, the remaining bills in circulation are decreasing. So a candy bar that costs $1 today is only going to cost $0.50 or so in 2 years - because when everyone has smaller quantities of money, smaller quantities of money are worth more. The real value of $1 is increasing over time, relative to candy bars. This makes USD a good investment: if you hoard a stash of dollars in good condition, you will have more value of USD when you eventually spend them.

This kind of attack is gonna rear its head in one form or another in any anonymous, fully peer-to-peer payment system.

The underlying problem is that you're relying on the nodes of a p2p network to maintain a payment history; the consensus opinion of all the nodes defines the ""truth"". But if you don't have a central authority that's assigning identities and deciding who can be a node in the network, then you'll always have the problem that a single powerful adversary can impersonate many nodes. Once he controls enough nodes, he can start tricking other nodes into believing different truths and can start double-spending his monies.

John Douceur wrote a [paper](http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/101.pdf) that laid out this problem and argued convincingly that there's no way to prevent someone from impersonating many nodes and launching a [Sybil attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). Like, you could say, ""one identity per IP address,"" but then a powerful adversary could come at you with a bunch of IPs in his quiver. You could say, ""one identity per X amount of computing power"" (the Bitcoin approach), but then someone with a truckload of video cards could attack you.

&gt;The [difficulty](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block each 10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took more than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find.

The time taken to find 2016 blocks depends entirely on the computational resources of the Bitcoin network. 

However I suppose you could say that interest in Bitcoin mining (the **motivation to mine**, so to speak) is also driven by the value of the Bitcoin. With more value there is more interest, more miners, more computational resources, and thus more difficulty increases. As [posting_from_work said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/h7ux6/mtgox_value_hits_498usdbtc/c1t9xvh), it's a bit of a feedback loop. 

However I think the feedback loop has its limits. You won't see very many people jumping on board to mine with their CPUs at this difficulty. I'm guessing anything less than 20MH/s is probably questionable considering it would take &gt;1 year to earn a block at that speed. And don't forget that difficulty can (and [did](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/speed-ever.png)) decrease. The system of difficulty calculation appears to be self-correcting.

That's great news. But I think I have to right to point out to people that they're buying into a pyramid scheme.

&gt; Being skeptical about something shouldn't automatically make it a scam, just somthing to research more.

Well that's what the Bitcoin guys keep saying on their wiki. Don't worry guys, it'll scale. _We just haven't figured out how to do it yet_. 

And they never will, because when you build a fully connected distributed system that uses global broadcast, you're not actually building a peer-to-peer system, you're building a _replicated server_. Which means you cannot cope with more transactions by adding more nodes, instead, you only make things worse. You can distribute a single node over multiple machines inside a datacentre, but that means the thing will be run by a federation of large corporations. 

It's only popular because it's a magic box that creates money out of thin air. 

&gt; Dismissing the whole thing as ""OMG IT IS A FUCKING SCAM, DON'T BE FOOLED"" is just... fucking retarded (lack of better words).

When something is too good to be true, it usually is. When there's money involved, it's probably a scam.

Feel free to debate my points if you will, but don't call me retarded simply because you don't understand my argumentation.

As for being optimistic about a person's ability to understand, again I would say that can lead to very undesirable results because believe it or not, your judgement about a person can be dead wrong and you're better off realizing that right away than later down the road because you were a nice guy. Again, I don't mean to sound like an asshole lol. Optimism is just another word for faith, and I make damn sure faith and my money stay the hell away from each other. Faith has no room in the financial world.

If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC. Instead, mention the vague concept of ""this new internet currency"" and give them a general description of the concept of BTC **without** mentioning the specific (and easily Googleable) word ""Bitcoin"". This is the approach I've taken with the handful of people I've recently decided to explain this concept to, and fortunately they both realized I knew exactly what I was talking about and that this ""internet currency"" is something I've secretly been investing in for a while.

Bottom line: Assume nothing about an individual until you have a fairly deep understanding of their ideologies, because that inadvertently is a huge factor when it comes to how they'll react to the concept of BTC.

This will only happen if the computing power keeps grows rapidly indefinitely. It's not about how much computer power there is, just about how fast it's growing.

Here are the numbers:

Every 2 weeks the difficulty resets so that a new block is made every 10 minutes. So if a new block is being made every, say, 8 minutes, then there is 25% more computing power mining coins than there was two weeks ago. This only lasts until the difficulty reset (which is every 2 weeks).

Let's assume the computing power quadruples every year (really generous assumption). This means that at the end of every two week period there is 5% more computing power than there was at the beginning of the two week period. So blocks could be minted up to 5% faster than planned.

The 18 million bitcoins point is planned for 2020, so it might happen in 2019 instead of 2020.

The more people lose their wallets (effectively removing those coins from the economy), the more the real value of Bitcoin increases for people who can manage not to misplace them.

You can picture it like this: imagine for the sake of simplicity that the US cuts off all contact with rest of the world, and the only currency available is USD. Now image the mints all shut down. Over time, the remaining bills in circulation are decreasing. So a candy bar that costs $1 today is only going to cost $0.50 or so in 2 years - because when everyone has smaller quantities of money, smaller quantities of money are worth more. The real value of $1 is increasing over time, relative to candy bars. This makes USD a good investment: if you hoard a stash of dollars in good condition, you will have more value of USD when you eventually spend them.

t3_h71r1,0,3,3,"&gt;In all of history, it is extremely doubtful that anybody has *ever* walked into a U.S. government office and demanded their gold in exchange for dollars.

This article really lost me at this point due to the fact that this is flat out false. You simply have to replace ""U.S. government office"" with ""bank.""

&gt;You made money. Out of nothing.

No, you didn't. Sure, the government can print more money, but when you go to work and 'make money,' you are not producing money that didn't already exist -- the person who pays you no longer has the money that they give to you for working, and the money that *they* have is given to them by customers who purchase an item / service, and then *they* no longer have that money, etc etc.

----

About half of what this guy is saying actually matters or means anything. Saying 'printing money doesn't cause hyperinflation' is like saying 'guns don't kill people' without the conditional '... unless they're wielded by someone with the intent to kill.' The point is, printing money *does* cause hyperinflation, just like guns kill people *when they are pointed at someone and fired.*

And that's the entire gist of this article -- it's half-truths combined with a Devil's Advocate approach to a system that seems to only be partially comprehended. There are some good points -- such as, one breach of the bitcoin security could spell disaster for the whole thing -- but there are other points -- such as it being an online-only currency -- that really do not matter in the slightest to what bitcoin is.

You know you can make copies of your wallet and seed them on multiple machines. So long as you keep syncing the wallets every once in a while, it will work as expected.

Technical details: Your wallet file is a pool of N private keys (default 100). When you generate a new address, it uses the next private key in sequence to do so, then generates a new one to fill it back to 100. So, say I make a copy of my wallet, and put it on a second computer. Now I generate a new address on computer A. What it does is it uses the next key in sequence, and then puts a new address on the end of the pool. Now I generate a new address on computer B. It pulls the next key in sequence, WHICH IS THE SAME AS ON COMPUTER A, and then generates a new one for the pool, which is DIFFERENT FROM COMPUTER A. 

So long as you re-sync them (that is, take the wallet from computer A and copy it over to computer B again) before generating 100 new addresses (which, at my rate, should be months), everything will work exactly as expected.",0,False,t1_c1t2dh4,True,Bitcoin,t1_c1t1lqd,c1t2dh4,0,[deleted],False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427130101,1304907354

The block that includes the nonce that you are hashing is the candidate for the next block in the block-chain, so it includes some header information, along with the output of another hash, which is the merkle tree root of all the transactions included within the block.  The target is the (very large) number below which your hash needs to fall, which means that most of the time, you'll calculate the hash, and it won't be below the target, so you'll increment the nonce, and calculate the hash again.  The target moves roughly every two weeks such that the average rate of people finding blocks is once every 10 minutes.  In this way, a block includes all of the transactions up until that block was successfully added to the block chain (if you change a transaction, it changes the merkle root, which changes the hash of the block, which means that it would be invalid (not below the target), so the block chain maintains consistency of the transactions accepted into the network.  The ""free money"" bit is that it is accepted practice to insert a ""coinbase transaction"" into the merkle root, which directs 50BTC to an address to which you have the private key, and a coinbase transaction alone does not need to have a source of bitcoins (all other transactions, to be accepted, need to have sources and destinations add up to the same amount of BTC.)",0,False,t1_c1ubjau,True,Bitcoin,t1_c1ubf7x,c1ubjau,0,agricocb,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427151852,1305549031

t3_hftn3,0,0,0,"&gt; it seems like the 15 million other BitCoins could be discovered in a decade or so.

This will only happen if the computing power keeps grows rapidly indefinitely. It's not about how much computer power there is, just about how fast it's growing.

Here are the numbers:

Every 2 weeks the difficulty resets so that a new block is made every 10 minutes. So if a new block is being made every, say, 8 minutes, then there is 25% more computing power mining coins than there was two weeks ago. This only lasts until the difficulty reset (which is every 2 weeks).

Let's assume the computing power quadruples every year (really generous assumption). This means that at the end of every two week period there is 5% more computing power than there was at the beginning of the two week period. So blocks could be minted up to 5% faster than planned.

The 18 million bitcoins point is planned for 2020, so it might happen in 2019 instead of 2020.

t3_haoba,0,2,2,"&gt; There are only so many dollars in the world

This is not true. [Money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) can be measured in variety of way.

For example, monetary base is essentially all the stuff issued by the central bank: notes, coins and bank reserves on accounts in the central bank.

But M1 and M2 aggregates include also 1) demand deposits people/companies have in banks and 2) other types of deposits. While they no longer represent money central banks control, they better indicators for what is happening because people can use demand accounts in banks as money.

Next relevant thing is [quantity theory of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money) which provides a link between money in circulation and price levels. It turns out that amount of money in circulation is just one side of the story, another is velocity of money, i.e. how fast money is changing hands.

What this equation tells us is that if velocity drops prices will also drop even if amount of money in circulation stays the same. You can see this during recessions -- money do not suddenly evaporate, of course, but people buy less things and businesses do less transactions on bad expectations, so according to this equation prices drop (deflation) which cause further downturn (it makes sense to do less transactions). That's why central banks inflate money supply during recessions -- to compensate for falling velocity of money.

&gt; there'd be around 40 trillion of them floating around (a number rising all the time)

Where did you get this from? It is definitely not an amount of 'physical' dollars (including 'electronic' dollars in the Fed) because Fed's balance sheet is much smaller.

So you're taking into account demand deposits in banks, it seems.

I see no problems with your calculations aside from that you're assuming there will no banks for bitcoins but you take into account 'USD banks'.

It doesn't even need to be banks. Any kind of short-term debts would do it too.",0,False,t1_c1tzsdg,True,Bitcoin,t3_haoba,c1tzsdg,0,killerstorm,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427146190,1305349864
t3_h7xqb,0,1,1,"I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. So I'm going to assume you don't know anything about crypto, and explain from basics. Apologies in advance if I come across as patronizing.

So the idea of hashing is that you can take an arbitrary input, and convert it into a mostly-unique ""fingerprint"", that satisfies a few requirements.

1) A generated hash appears to be random, using statistical measures of such things

2) Given a hash, it is impossible to get the input data back

3) Finding two inputs that have the same hash should be very very very hard. (But not impossible)

As an aside, the reason #3 says ""not impossible"" is because of an incredibly simple concept that hoity-toity computer scientists call ""The pigeonhole principle"". Basically, for instance, if you have an 8-bit hash, then there are 256 different hashes that are possible. So give it 256 different inputs. Now give it 1 more. 257 different inputs are converted into 256 outputs; there is going to be at least one duplicate. The only reason this is not generally a problem is because we use very large numbers; the hash for bitcoin blocks is 256 bits, which means there are 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 different possible outputs.

Now, for a block to be valid, it has to be signed with a hash. However, in order to control the rate at which the blocks are generated, that hash must also have a numerical value less than the ""target"" (which is calculated from the difficulty, I can't remember how). Since hashes are supposed to act randomly, effectively what you're saying is ""when I generate a hash, it has a (target / 2^256) chance of being valid. If it's not valid, try again"". Because of statistics, and staggeringly large numbers, it works. 

The reason that these hashes can be used for validation is, again, the properties of a hash. If all you had was a hash, it would be effectively impossible to create a block that had that specific value for a hash. But if you already know what the block is, you can hash it (which is trivially fast; my $300 GFX card can calculate could hash the entire block chain 250ish times per second). So, what you can do is ask the official block history: ""What is the hash for this block that i have stored on my computer?"". The block history can say ""it's 8967234816473649781234612378423"". Then you can check. If it doesn't match, you know something fishy is going on

The question I have is... how would the network even know the coins are lost?!? And, for that matter, how would anyone know this to make all other bitcoins more valuable? If the owner can't use them anymore, they would basically be just sitting around in the network with the last transaction signed by this owner who no one can trace. They will still be there... it's just that no one else could use them.

Correct me if I am wrong... but I take the stand to say that some kind of ""keep-alive"" signal could be implemented. If the owner can access the coins, it should be able to, for example, update a timestamp on its last transaction to prove they are not lost. If this keep-alive is not updated for a reasonable human lifetime period (say, 60 or 80 years), then they could be officially considered lost and the last owner invalidated. Invalid lost coins could return the the market and people could still find them again in the form of mining.

Is this a good idea?

BitCoin -&gt; tied to a unique number. It's also a deflationary currency, which is probably the only reason people are considering it to be valued as high as it is. There will reach a point when no more coins will be made.

ArtCoin -&gt; tied to a unique piece of artwork. Unless you are planning to limit the maximum number of coins here, it's probably going to be an inflationary currency. 

Basically, the reason BitCoin is gaining is because it's a strong signal that people are fed up with the Fed. The USD took on the losses from the bailouts, by moving those toxic assets from the banks, to the Reserve. Those assets haven't gone anywhere, and are unlikely to appreciate in value any time soon. The Euro is experiencing a similar signal, but for different reasons. 

People are tired of having their bank accounts raided, and their currencies plundered. They are tired of inflationary currencies that only make them poorer; they are tired of the various bad-faith accounting tricks we have seen employed recently, and they want to keep their money. Not its face value, but its real worth.

What we can empirically observe is that humans purchase various things, while others save money, and on occassion some pay in order to save money.

t3_h7xqb,0,1,1,"I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. So I'm going to assume you don't know anything about crypto, and explain from basics. Apologies in advance if I come across as patronizing.

So the idea of hashing is that you can take an arbitrary input, and convert it into a mostly-unique ""fingerprint"", that satisfies a few requirements.

1) A generated hash appears to be random, using statistical measures of such things

2) Given a hash, it is impossible to get the input data back

3) Finding two inputs that have the same hash should be very very very hard. (But not impossible)

As an aside, the reason #3 says ""not impossible"" is because of an incredibly simple concept that hoity-toity computer scientists call ""The pigeonhole principle"". Basically, for instance, if you have an 8-bit hash, then there are 256 different hashes that are possible. So give it 256 different inputs. Now give it 1 more. 257 different inputs are converted into 256 outputs; there is going to be at least one duplicate. The only reason this is not generally a problem is because we use very large numbers; the hash for bitcoin blocks is 256 bits, which means there are 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 different possible outputs.

Now, for a block to be valid, it has to be signed with a hash. However, in order to control the rate at which the blocks are generated, that hash must also have a numerical value less than the ""target"" (which is calculated from the difficulty, I can't remember how). Since hashes are supposed to act randomly, effectively what you're saying is ""when I generate a hash, it has a (target / 2^256) chance of being valid. If it's not valid, try again"". Because of statistics, and staggeringly large numbers, it works. 

The reason that these hashes can be used for validation is, again, the properties of a hash. If all you had was a hash, it would be effectively impossible to create a block that had that specific value for a hash. But if you already know what the block is, you can hash it (which is trivially fast; my $300 GFX card can calculate could hash the entire block chain 250ish times per second). So, what you can do is ask the official block history: ""What is the hash for this block that i have stored on my computer?"". The block history can say ""it's 8967234816473649781234612378423"". Then you can check. If it doesn't match, you know something fishy is going on

First of all, so long as I copy my wallet from one computer, to the other, before I generate 100 new keys. Second, I've only got two computers, and it's very much a master/slave set up, so it's not that complicated for me. 

As far as syncing wallets within the protocol, I'm unsure of how you'd do that. Wallets can *sort of* share bitcoins right now, due to the way wallets actually work. Wallets are a list of private keys, and each private key corresponds to a bitcoin receiving address. If the block chain has a record that says, for instance, ""ADDRESS 12345 RECEIVES 5 BITCOINS"", and I have a wallet file that has the private key that corresponds to address 12345, then I have the bitcoins. I can make as many copies of that wallet as I want, and they all have those bitcoins. If I then exhaust the new address pool in two copies of the wallet, I'll then have two wallets that are different, but both share those old coins.

The only way that a wallet would be able to share coins is to share private keys. But, basically, there's no good way to exchange private keys, short of physically, manually doing it. So I think that there might not be a good way to do that in the protocol. What I would like (and this might already exist) is a convenient mechanism to deal with wallets. Routine backup.

That sounds like a lot, but you need something like a quadrillion hashes on average to solve a block. Napkin math, that's about 538 days, and that number will only increase as difficulty increases.

2) Any of the mining pools will do. Some don't require you to register, you just use your address as the username. Those might be considered easier but they normally take a bigger cut.

3) You can have any number of addresses stored in your wallet. An address is just a hash of a public key, which is itself derived from the private key.

Mostly investor types (in bulk anyway). People think the value will go up (and due to the deflationary nature of the currency it's less risky than other typical investments) will buy some to sell later. For comparison, I spent £60 on coins, and bought in when the value per coin was 0.6. Also, people who wish to get into using bitcoin are better off buying than trying to mine with poor hardware: at this point it costs more for the electricity to try and mine (unless you are using a GPU).

I personally see myself providing bitcoin related webservices with these coins, and maybe I'll make some purchases. It's also a long term investment for me though.

&gt;How widespread is the use of GPU computing in Bitcoin mining, and how does that compare to its utilization rate in other potential applications?
    
Anyone whio is *successfully* mining above the cost for electricity is using GPUs. As for it's utilization rate, I can only really offer [this](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=4689.0 ""From the official forums"") thread as an answer, as I don't really mine (my roommate does though, and makes a profit despite his added share of the electricity bill :)

&gt; Why don't people create new blockchains starting from new roots, so that they can have tons of easy Bitcoins?
    
They could, I could start generating ""GigitrixCoins"" tomorrow. The problem is, that no-one accepts these as a currency. The currency only has value if people use it. You could easily see how this has other applications though: I could start an MMO that has realworld elements and uses an alternate blockchain, for instance. Let me stress: an alternate blockchain creates completely different currency.

t3_gyr9x,0,2,2,"I was hoping that Bitcoin won't be officially recognized as a form of money and a payment system as long as possible.

If you look at it from technical perspective, it is just a cryptographic/network protocol to exchange cryptographic signatures in a way that guarantees certain invariants (scarcity). 

There is nothing about 'money' on the technical side, I think in theory system like this could be used for many things. Bitcoins have nothing to do with obligations of any sort, there is no central entity which controls them, they have no inherent value.

Even if it is recognized as a payment system it is not different from any in-game ""pretend money"", toy-money system (which also guarantees scarcity (otherwise game won't be interesting)), or just resources/bonuses/score etc.

I.e. if someone will create a peer-to-peer monopoly game its money would be similar to bitcoins.

But I'm sure government doesn't want to know about all these scarce-resources in game which in theory can be used as a currency.

So why does it want to know about Bitcoin?

I think that's just because Bitcoin is positioned as digital currency/payment system. People (particularly, developers) call it this way and so it is considered in this way.

This, of course, helps with economy growth, but also would allow gov't to ban it or take other actions as there are laws on money laundering, tax evasion, security exchanges and stuff like that.

So if I was trying to implement something like bitcoin from scratch I will try hard to split it into a general transaction processing core and a separate payment system. Then I would encourage uses which are not related to real money -- like use for in-game money (or, even better, other in-game resources which are not called money), name registration (see namecoin), maybe message exchange service and stuff like that. And only then I'd try to introduce 'real money' on top of this.

Then it would be harder for gov't to shut down core transaction processing system because it has both legitimate and illegitimate uses (just like anything else, e.g. official cash), cf. video recorders.

And, more importantly, I guess there would be different attitude, so maybe banning the thing won't even come up.

But if you talk about competing with fiat money from the start results would be different.

This kind of attack is gonna rear its head in one form or another in any anonymous, fully peer-to-peer payment system.

The underlying problem is that you're relying on the nodes of a p2p network to maintain a payment history; the consensus opinion of all the nodes defines the ""truth"". But if you don't have a central authority that's assigning identities and deciding who can be a node in the network, then you'll always have the problem that a single powerful adversary can impersonate many nodes. Once he controls enough nodes, he can start tricking other nodes into believing different truths and can start double-spending his monies.

John Douceur wrote a [paper](http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/101.pdf) that laid out this problem and argued convincingly that there's no way to prevent someone from impersonating many nodes and launching a [Sybil attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). Like, you could say, ""one identity per IP address,"" but then a powerful adversary could come at you with a bunch of IPs in his quiver. You could say, ""one identity per X amount of computing power"" (the Bitcoin approach), but then someone with a truckload of video cards could attack you.

If the objective is globalization, BitCoin does fit well as a global currency.  It has some interesting properties that help globalization.

1. You cannot physically steel BitCoins.  In fact, attempting to do so could result in destruction of BitCoins and deflation.  You may be able to hack someone's computer and take the BitCoin wallet, but that is a lot less destructive than threatening or killing them.
2. Deflation will encourage slower growth.  This happens because people can sit on their appreciating BitCoins instead of working to avoid inflation.  Slower growth fits better with the environmental problems we are having with massive industrialization.
3. BitCoins have the potential to be ubiquitous.  As long as there is an internet connection, BitCoins can exist.  One could send money to anyone around the globe in a matter of minutes.  People in emerging nations would have a way to exchange value unencumbered banking structures and corruption. (Assuming infrastructure for internet or data cell phone service.)  Again, theft becomes difficult and the poor have a better chance of accumulating wealth.
4. People would have more faith in a decentralized uncontrolled money system.  This would spur smart growth instead of the steroid induced growth the world has seen thus far.  (Freedom is a great way to encourage innovation.)
5. Going to physical war would only destroy BitCoins and slow down economic production in both the attacking and defending countries.
6. Encouraging or allowing BitCoins to become a real currency would be seen as an indication to ""Gold Bugs"" and others in the Libertarian movement that the world powers are not interested in power for powers sake, but are rather interested in the advancement of world civilization.

Which you cannot quantify in any way. Therefore you do not ""measure"" it.

&gt;When we consider an economic decision between two choices, we are deciding between the value we get from the marginal utility of one thing versus the value we get from the marginal utility of the other

NooooooooOOoOOOOoooo

This is homo economicus level bullshit.

&gt;But you JUST said, 'humans eat when their physical discomfort forces them to'. Humans... in general. How can you say that when it is in fact my premise, and you're telling me that I cannot hold it without being some sort of conceited person who assumes knowledge? LOL listen to your bloody self.

Cheezus fucking christ. I am not stating anything else than empirical fact. I am not extrapolating to anything, unlike you who think you can prove the rules of interest by the fact that humans eat when they're hungry!

&gt;Which is not any way incompatible with what I'm doing, other than your assumption of duty. When Einstein formed theories he didn't HAVE to find a way to empirically test them. Other people can do that. There's no duty there.

Yeah, you're a regular Einstein alright. Only you have provided nothing in the sense of empirical research or falsification. In short, you're nothing like Einstein.

&gt;But regardless, I formed a general theory which is falsifiable. If you see empirically that humans in fact don't prefer an amount of marginal utility now to an equal amount of marginal utility later

When you can show me how you quantify ""marginal utility"" so that you can compare two values to see if they're equal, we can talk about you having a falsifiable theory. Until then, you have a theory that is built on nothing but air.

The fact that humans want to eat when they're hungry does not prove your economic edifices.

&gt;We observe that humans will prefer to maximise their quality of life and their standard of living.

Stop replying to stuff without having an actual point to make. What you said now is completely irrelevant, even if you can word it in a way that makes sense. Note: The above doesn't, because ""standard of living"" and ""quality of life"" are completely subjective and you have no way of knowing if someone is indeed ""maximizing"" them.

&gt;Grrrrr. I've already explained how it's not a cop out. I never said, 'well markets always work'. I said if you come to accept that a vibrant market can emerge then it would allow you to conclude that it would iron out the kinks.

We are discussing **if** a ""vibrant market can emerge that will iron out the kinks"" using the bitcoin currency. I posited an example showing that such a currency might cause systemic failure of such a market. From then on, you started talking about ""vibrant markets ironing out kinks"". I don't know why you did, I assumed it had something to do with the example I posited, but apparently it doesn't. So excuse me for being confused on why you brought it up in the first place instead of addressing my example.

t3_hc82b,0,1,1,"&gt; doesn't seem too fair

Keep in mind the hashing isn't just a way to hand out bitcoins, it's also keeping the system itself working.  

From many comments I've read, most people are already at the point where the energy costs exceed or equal the payout.  Eventually bitcoin amounts will be smaller and farther between, and those who have the winning hash will earn more from transaction fees than from the bitcoin generation.

I'm not sure why the khash varies so much, mine stays pretty consistently +/- 10% when I watch it.  Keep in mind 5000 khash/s is mostly a sort of long shot lottery, as it would take on average 1565 days to win a hash at the current difficulty (which is very likely to go up significantly in the next two days).

Just for fun I have coin generation on with my desktop (set to use one cpu), but my primary interest isn't with mining.  What I'm probably going to do is use bitcoin to ""garage sale"" a bunch of stuff in my storage unit without all the eBay/paypal red tape and risks.

If nobody has suggested a viable solution yet it suggests that the problem is at least nontrivial.

For most people pooled mining has a higher expected value or higher long term payout.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Why_pooled_mining

Pooled mining makes sense when you account for changing difficulty. If you mine with a CPU or slow video card you should join a pool.

Because the difficulty rises about 2% per day, the correct model is a Poisson process where the rate is exponential decaying. You want to get paid as often as possible while the difficulty is increasing. 

If the difficulty were to stop increasing then it doesn't make any sense to be in a pool.

Lastly, the pools are all charing less than 3% and several are 1% or less.

------------------
[I'm wrong here as shadow dust pointed out. My apologies] 

The expected values are indeed the same. But for most people solo mining has a ~95% of never generating anything and pooled mining is virtually guaranteed to give you the EV - 0-3% depending on the pool.

&gt;The [difficulty](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block each 10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took more than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find.

The time taken to find 2016 blocks depends entirely on the computational resources of the Bitcoin network. 

However I suppose you could say that interest in Bitcoin mining (the **motivation to mine**, so to speak) is also driven by the value of the Bitcoin. With more value there is more interest, more miners, more computational resources, and thus more difficulty increases. As [posting_from_work said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/h7ux6/mtgox_value_hits_498usdbtc/c1t9xvh), it's a bit of a feedback loop. 

However I think the feedback loop has its limits. You won't see very many people jumping on board to mine with their CPUs at this difficulty. I'm guessing anything less than 20MH/s is probably questionable considering it would take &gt;1 year to earn a block at that speed. And don't forget that difficulty can (and [did](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/speed-ever.png)) decrease. The system of difficulty calculation appears to be self-correcting.

Thus users will have to rely on powerful nodes which act as clearing houses of some sort.

If there are trusted clearing houses then you don't need that many transactions as clearing houses can settle transactions internally and use real bitcoin transactions only to settle final balances among themselves. 

I.e. consider [eWallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/EWallet)s like [MyBitcoin](http://www.mybitcoin.com/):

&gt; Transactions to a Bitcoin address from the same wallet provider are usually completed internally and, if so, will not be processed on the Bitcoin P2P network. Auditing tools such as the Block Explorer will not show any activity for this transaction. 
&gt; Some wallet providers allow amounts below 0.01 BTC to be sent if the transaction is to another account holder on the same service. This allows an inexpensive and immediate method to detect if the recipient is using the same wallet provider. For example, MyBitcoin will report an error when attempting to send an amount smaller than 0.01 BTC to a Bitcoin address that is not for another MyBitcoin account.

So I think use of ewallets or stuff like that would be pretty much inevitable whether you want it or not.

The only other option is to restructure protocols and, perhaps, cryptography to support divide-and-conquer algorithms of some sort. Maybe multiple block chains instead of a single monolithic one, with groups of nodes each responsible for its own chain.

t3_gz79a,0,2,2,"&gt; Relying on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

There is also a compromise solution -- you would hold your bitcoins in a private crypto wallet, but transfer a portion of them to a clearing house to do small scale transactions.

0.01 BTC fee if sending any transaction less than 0.01 BTC. **This is to help prevent DoS attacks against the network.** Remember: fees are not network-enforced, so it's still possible to send these small transactions without the fee -- you just have to generate the blocks that contain them yourself (after modifying Bitcoin).*

*0.01 BTC fee per kilobyte of transaction, but:*

&gt;*If the blocksize (size of all transactions currently waiting to be included in a block) is less than 27 kB, transactions are free.*

&gt;*If the blocksize is more than 250 kB, transactions get increasingly more expensive as the blocksize approaches the limit of 500 kB. Sending a transaction when the blocksize is 400 kB will cost 5 times the normal amount; sending when it's 499 kB will cost 500x, etc.*

&gt;*Transactions within each fee tier are prioritized based on several factors. Most importantly, a transaction has more priority if the coins it is using have a lot of confirmations. Someone spamming the network will almost certainly be re-using the same coins, which will lower the priority of their transactions. Priority is also increased for transactions with more BTC, and reduced for transactions with more data.*

&gt;*If the blocksize is over 4kB, free transactions in the above rules are only allowed if the transaction's priority is above a certain level.*",0,False,t1_c1u9d2d,True,Bitcoin,t3_hc6v6,c1u9d2d,0,[deleted],False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427150832,1305509773

t3_he664,0,1,1,"&gt;The subjective measure of utility is just the use you are able to derive from something.

Which you cannot quantify in any way. Therefore you do not ""measure"" it.

&gt;When we consider an economic decision between two choices, we are deciding between the value we get from the marginal utility of one thing versus the value we get from the marginal utility of the other

NooooooooOOoOOOOoooo

This is homo economicus level bullshit.

&gt;But you JUST said, 'humans eat when their physical discomfort forces them to'. Humans... in general. How can you say that when it is in fact my premise, and you're telling me that I cannot hold it without being some sort of conceited person who assumes knowledge? LOL listen to your bloody self.

Cheezus fucking christ. I am not stating anything else than empirical fact. I am not extrapolating to anything, unlike you who think you can prove the rules of interest by the fact that humans eat when they're hungry!

&gt;Which is not any way incompatible with what I'm doing, other than your assumption of duty. When Einstein formed theories he didn't HAVE to find a way to empirically test them. Other people can do that. There's no duty there.

Yeah, you're a regular Einstein alright. Only you have provided nothing in the sense of empirical research or falsification. In short, you're nothing like Einstein.

&gt;But regardless, I formed a general theory which is falsifiable. If you see empirically that humans in fact don't prefer an amount of marginal utility now to an equal amount of marginal utility later

When you can show me how you quantify ""marginal utility"" so that you can compare two values to see if they're equal, we can talk about you having a falsifiable theory. Until then, you have a theory that is built on nothing but air.

The fact that humans want to eat when they're hungry does not prove your economic edifices.

&gt;We observe that humans will prefer to maximise their quality of life and their standard of living.

Stop replying to stuff without having an actual point to make. What you said now is completely irrelevant, even if you can word it in a way that makes sense. Note: The above doesn't, because ""standard of living"" and ""quality of life"" are completely subjective and you have no way of knowing if someone is indeed ""maximizing"" them.

&gt;Grrrrr. I've already explained how it's not a cop out. I never said, 'well markets always work'. I said if you come to accept that a vibrant market can emerge then it would allow you to conclude that it would iron out the kinks.

We are discussing **if** a ""vibrant market can emerge that will iron out the kinks"" using the bitcoin currency. I posited an example showing that such a currency might cause systemic failure of such a market. From then on, you started talking about ""vibrant markets ironing out kinks"". I don't know why you did, I assumed it had something to do with the example I posited, but apparently it doesn't. So excuse me for being confused on why you brought it up in the first place instead of addressing my example.

t3_h7xqb,0,1,1,"I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. So I'm going to assume you don't know anything about crypto, and explain from basics. Apologies in advance if I come across as patronizing.

So the idea of hashing is that you can take an arbitrary input, and convert it into a mostly-unique ""fingerprint"", that satisfies a few requirements.

1) A generated hash appears to be random, using statistical measures of such things

2) Given a hash, it is impossible to get the input data back

3) Finding two inputs that have the same hash should be very very very hard. (But not impossible)

As an aside, the reason #3 says ""not impossible"" is because of an incredibly simple concept that hoity-toity computer scientists call ""The pigeonhole principle"". Basically, for instance, if you have an 8-bit hash, then there are 256 different hashes that are possible. So give it 256 different inputs. Now give it 1 more. 257 different inputs are converted into 256 outputs; there is going to be at least one duplicate. The only reason this is not generally a problem is because we use very large numbers; the hash for bitcoin blocks is 256 bits, which means there are 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 different possible outputs.

Now, for a block to be valid, it has to be signed with a hash. However, in order to control the rate at which the blocks are generated, that hash must also have a numerical value less than the ""target"" (which is calculated from the difficulty, I can't remember how). Since hashes are supposed to act randomly, effectively what you're saying is ""when I generate a hash, it has a (target / 2^256) chance of being valid. If it's not valid, try again"". Because of statistics, and staggeringly large numbers, it works. 

The reason that these hashes can be used for validation is, again, the properties of a hash. If all you had was a hash, it would be effectively impossible to create a block that had that specific value for a hash. But if you already know what the block is, you can hash it (which is trivially fast; my $300 GFX card can calculate could hash the entire block chain 250ish times per second). So, what you can do is ask the official block history: ""What is the hash for this block that i have stored on my computer?"". The block history can say ""it's 8967234816473649781234612378423"". Then you can check. If it doesn't match, you know something fishy is going on

t3_gz79a,0,2,2,"&gt; Relying on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

There is also a compromise solution -- you would hold your bitcoins in a private crypto wallet, but transfer a portion of them to a clearing house to do small scale transactions. Then if clearing house goes rogue you would lose only a tiny portion of your savings.

t3_g9lti,0,3,3,"&gt;Who in the market is buying Bitcoins, and what do they see themselves doing with them?    
    
Mostly investor types (in bulk anyway). People think the value will go up (and due to the deflationary nature of the currency it's less risky than other typical investments) will buy some to sell later. For comparison, I spent £60 on coins, and bought in when the value per coin was 0.6. Also, people who wish to get into using bitcoin are better off buying than trying to mine with poor hardware: at this point it costs more for the electricity to try and mine (unless you are using a GPU).

I personally see myself providing bitcoin related webservices with these coins, and maybe I'll make some purchases. It's also a long term investment for me though.

&gt;How widespread is the use of GPU computing in Bitcoin mining, and how does that compare to its utilization rate in other potential applications?
    
Anyone whio is *successfully* mining above the cost for electricity is using GPUs. As for it's utilization rate, I can only really offer [this](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=4689.0 ""From the official forums"") thread as an answer, as I don't really mine (my roommate does though, and makes a profit despite his added share of the electricity bill :)

&gt; Why don't people create new blockchains starting from new roots, so that they can have tons of easy Bitcoins?
    
They could, I could start generating ""GigitrixCoins"" tomorrow. The problem is, that no-one accepts these as a currency. The currency only has value if people use it. You could easily see how this has other applications though: I could start an MMO that has realworld elements and uses an alternate blockchain, for instance. Let me stress: an alternate blockchain creates completely different currency.

&gt; Who enforces increases in difficulty?
    
Each copy of bitcoin enforces the difficulty increase by calculating the new difficulty individually. If I said the difficulty is only ""1"", then the other nodes in the network say that my calculation is invalid and it doesn't go any further.

t3_h71r1,0,3,3,"&gt;In all of history, it is extremely doubtful that anybody has *ever* walked into a U.S. government office and demanded their gold in exchange for dollars.

This article really lost me at this point due to the fact that this is flat out false. You simply have to replace ""U.S. government office"" with ""bank.""

&gt;You made money. Out of nothing.

No, you didn't. Sure, the government can print more money, but when you go to work and 'make money,' you are not producing money that didn't already exist -- the person who pays you no longer has the money that they give to you for working, and the money that *they* have is given to them by customers who purchase an item / service, and then *they* no longer have that money, etc etc.

----

About half of what this guy is saying actually matters or means anything. Saying 'printing money doesn't cause hyperinflation' is like saying 'guns don't kill people' without the conditional '... unless they're wielded by someone with the intent to kill.' The point is, printing money *does* cause hyperinflation, just like guns kill people *when they are pointed at someone and fired.*

And that's the entire gist of this article -- it's half-truths combined with a Devil's Advocate approach to a system that seems to only be partially comprehended. There are some good points -- such as, one breach of the bitcoin security could spell disaster for the whole thing -- but there are other points -- such as it being an online-only currency -- that really do not matter in the slightest to what bitcoin is.

I'm guessing you're in finance.  My background is physics and comp sci so I probably model this a bit like an ass ... but my intuition is to model them like gold. I don't think they actually make a very good currency.

I think they have a very practical use for storing value into the future. They're superior to gold because they have lower transaction costs, rent and are safer and harder to steal. They're inferior because they have a shorter history and could go poof.

From what I can tell the value of gold has nothing to do with it's intrinsic value for industry or cosmetic properties, it's based on it's utility as a very safe wealth store.

Do you have an opinion on the best way to model the value of gold? There are a lot of kooks and theories about it but what method/model are big firms like Goldman Sachs using? http://www.thestreet.com/story/11051465/1/gold-prices-to-hit-1480-goldman.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN

I'm not at all confident bitcoins wont have their value spiral into nothing but at the moment libertarians love them and while there is a lot of speculation happening, I do think they have a decent chance of maintaining long term value.

So no simulation or anything that fancy. I just want to calculate the utility of bitcoins compared to other wealth stores and calculate what the possible values would likely to be after short term speculators loose interest.

t3_h76w0,0,1,1,"&gt;Instead of printing more money you just reduce the value of everything by adding another decimal place. Until it stabilizes, BTC will rapidly grow in value relative to the USD until 1BTC is worth roughly 40,000 USD.

This is only a byproduct of prices initially being set in USD, and then converted to BTC based on the exchange rate (which isn't very robust, since it's based almost entirely on the going rate on MtGox). Once businesses are able to pay for at least some of their costs with bitcoin, they can price goods in bitcoin primarily which will remove (I believe) a lot of the price volatility.

Also, it's not a requirement of Bitcoin that your private keys (the only thing **you** need to keep available and secure) are stored on a personal computer. There is at least one member of the community working on a secure hardware device that stores keys and does the signing - the keys are never shared with an untrusted device.

Also, you can encrypt and back up your wallet (the key storage for Bitcoin right now) to any number of services like Dropbox, Wuala, Gmail, Carbonite... whatever. Right now, this has to be done manually, but there will eventually be tools to automate this.

The process of earning Bitcoins for completing a block is not analogous to a central banking authority whimsically giving money to random individuals. (Also, this is PRECISELY what the mint did in 1849 when people spent their time and energy mining gold and getting paper money from the mint)

&gt;""Importantly, the people on the other end of those transactions did not just get free money.""

Neither dose an individual who completes a block.  Their computations cost them time/money/energy, and the benefit to the network as a whole is that BitCoin is more secure the more honest nodes there are.

This is the same as gold-backed currency (like the dollar you seem to be touting).  The only difference is that no one is in control of currency creation (then again, no one is in control of how much gold is in the Earth).

&gt;""Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?).""

To answer his last question, the solution has already occurred.  There now exist large mining ""pools"" where you can contribute calculations with your bitcoin client, and you get a share of the proceeds in a more steady rate over time.  (instead of having to wait to finish one block in a matter of years, you can get .01123127 BTC per day)

&gt;""Question: If your money is getting predictably more valuable, why would you want to spend it?""

Answer: Financial behaviors are (and should be) up to the individual.  People will spend money when they need/want things more than they want the money they have.  Haven't you ever heard of supply and demand?  And you're lecturing *us* on 'basic economics'?

&gt;""In the best case scenario [the one where it becomes popular] the limited supply of Bitcoin will cause crippling deflation, drying up most Bitcoin-denominated commerce save whatever speculative buying and selling happens on exchanges. Some new world order. All that transparency and all those low interchange fees aren't going to do you much good if you don't ever want to spend these things and no one wants to give them to you anyway.""

As deflation occurs, people won't 'spend less', they will use fewer Bitcoins for the same things they are doing every day.

If tomorrow you woke up, and there were half as many dollars in the world, AND everyone owned half as many as they did the day before (in some magical way), here's what will happen:

The McDonald's dollar menu will become the 50-cent menu.

Each of your dollars is worth twice as much, and you aren't willing to spend as much to buy the same things you enjoy (maybe you don't enjoy McDonalds, but it's just an example).

Since BitCoins are *very very* divisible, predictable, long term deflation doesn't make this a 'non-viable' currency.

Another neat side of GPU mining is that it leaves your CPU idle, and is designed to yield to other GPU-using stuff politely, so you can keep it running 24/7 while watching videos/gaming/whatever and not have to care too much. (some games may seem choppier under some conditions. you can always stop mining during your gaming session.)

if you check the forums on bitcoin.org, there should be a bunch of threads about GPU mining, including links to various miners you can download.

Miners run side-by-side with the bitcoin client (or in the case of a mining pool (like [Slush's pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/), standalone but chatting with the pooling server very regularly)

If nothing else, playing with GPU mining helped me realize the insane computing power my so-called video card contains (my oldish ATI 5770 can do a solid single-precision TeraFLOPS, which kinda blows my mind. In bitcoin terms, it computes 160 Mhash/s, where each hash consists of almost 2 full SHA-256 runs so that's over 300 million SHA-256/s. So that's kinda cool, and it keeps doing the regular video stuff while computing all that.)

As an aside, I'm still mining with my little 5770 as part of a pool. at the beginning of the year, I was getting 8 BTC a day. nowadays, it's closer to 3 BTC a day. My GPU consumes 280 Watts, running 24/7, that's ~ 6.7 kWh. My power company charges $0.052/kWh, so that means my 3 BTC/day cost about $0.35. At current rates, it's still worth doing. Hell, I just realized I'm basically mining enough BTCs to cover my entire electric bills so far.

So that's my little take on the whole ""mining ain't profitable"" concept. I'm really not doing it for the money, it's just something fun to waste GPU cycles on.

If there are trusted clearing houses then you don't need that many transactions as clearing houses can settle transactions internally and use real bitcoin transactions only to settle final balances among themselves. 

I.e. consider [eWallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/EWallet)s like [MyBitcoin](http://www.mybitcoin.com/):

&gt; Transactions to a Bitcoin address from the same wallet provider are usually completed internally and, if so, will not be processed on the Bitcoin P2P network. Auditing tools such as the Block Explorer will not show any activity for this transaction.

t3_hfv4a,0,24,24,"You're starting with a completely false premise. 

Economic history is not taught in econ programs so there is very little knowledge about the past, thus its tough to rebut today's orthodoxy. For example, I believe between the end of the Civil War and the late 19th century, the US money supply declined somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% or 70%. The population exploded, economic activity boomed, and the US became a world power in one of the greatest economic leaps in history -- all with a depreciating currency. Additionally, nineteenth century Britain experienced 50 years of falling prices, even though living standards rose at an unprecedented rate and level. From 1875 to 1895 wholesale prices fell by about 45 per cent while industrial output and real wages continued to rise. 

The ""problem"" with deflation in a fiat system is that deflation happens when debts are not paid, after all, money = debt. So if debts are written off, so is a portion of the money supply. On the other hand, in a bitcoin economy, deflation happens because the value of the currency rises out of supply/demand reasons, not debt defaults. In no small part this is a political problem, as much as an economic problem. 

Having bitcoins increase in value will encourage adoption of the system. Secondly, inflation can happen in a bitcoin economy, but only when the economy is contracting. When that happens holders of bitcoins will be incentivized to spend because no one wants to hold a currency that is losing value, thus increasing market transactions and product, which in turn would smooth out disruptions to the economy.",0,True,t1_c1v3edy,True,Bitcoin,t3_hfv4a,c1v3edy,0,TragicHipster,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427165250,1305904615

1. BTC inflation rate is currently at 50% per year.  This will decrease to 33% next year, and will eventually start to become reasonable in 2017 when BTC inflation will be around 4% per year.
2. Acceptance of BTC may outpace it's inflation rate, so BTC values may shoot up on speculation.  It could also fall rapidly on bad news.
3. Although not illegal nor immoral to own or use BTC, the powers that be may decide to take actions (regardless of what the law says or allows) to destroy BitCoin.
4. Laws may be passed to force users of cryptology to entrust keys with government agencies.  In the states, this is a clear violation of constitutional rights, but lately, the constitution does not seem to matter.  I've read about the requirement in either the U.K. or E.U. to provide upon request keys to encrypted data on your hard drive if the government requests it.  If you don't provide the keys, you could face jail time.
5. On the up side, if BTC were to replace the current U.S. money supply, each BTC would be worth around $650,000 each.  If BTC were to replace global currency, each BTC would be worth around $2.1 Million each.

My personal take on BTC is to use it like novelty money or an instrument of speculation/investment.  Eventually, the centers of power will find ways to sideline BitCoin, as they need ways to inflate money for purposes of war.

So we're talking around $3 million just in terms of hardware, but you also need to account for the cost of the data center, cooling, power supply, networking and engineering support.

For instance, the cost of supplying power to all that hardware would be over $1 million per month, without even accounting for cooling.

But maybe you could put together a data center powerful enough for $10 million. What then? The most you can do is reverse transactions, so if you want to recoup your $10m investment cost, you'll need to buy up at least $10m worth of bitcoins.

So you manage to buy up $10m worth of coins, and you now have $20m sunk into this venture. You can then sell off all these coins and then reverse the transactions so you can sell them *again*, recouping your losses through fraud.

Unfortunately for you, selling off a quarter of the market would immediately devalue the currency. You'd need to sell the money off gradually to prevent a market slump.

But *then* you have the problem of detection. It's going to be pretty obvious that you're screwing around with the block chain if suddenly long alternative branches start appearing, and people start screaming about their lost money. You also be losing a bunch of money in power and maintenance costs.

And therein lies another major problem; even *if* you had all that computing power, using it to reverse transactions would be a criminal act. You'd be charged under fraud and computer hacking laws if you were caught.

So its unlikely that someone would sink $20m into a venture to defraud a market worth only $40m, especially since the chance of making a profit and getting away with it seems rather slim.

If you were a hacker with a large enough botnet, then it *might* be worthwhile, but you'd only be able to scam a small fraction of the market before you were found out and people stopped sending you money. It would probably be more profitable to use your vast botnet for spam, DDOS attacks, etc.

&gt;A raw version of that function that is not corrected for the expected increase in computing power. That is, a function with number of Bitcoins on the X axis and the amount of CPU cycles needed to generate the next Bitcoin on the Y axis.

That is the raw function. The FAQ says:

""The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.""

The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.

That just can't happen unless governments start to accept bitcoins as legal tender. Bitcoin can't replace local currencies for the simpler reasons that:

1. When you offer legal tender as payment, it extinguishes the debt. If you pay with bitcoin,
cheque, credit card or debit card, payment is not legally paid until you have local currency in your hand or account.
2.  You must pay taxes, fees and services for government institutions in local currency (so there is always transaction to legal tender). Companies  must do their accounting in legal tender. They must convert anything that is taxed to legal tender nominations.

&gt; Yeah, you definitely can't do what you're saying. The clients aren't just looking for the longest block chain out there. The blocks that are created already exist and will exist for all of BitCoins existence.

&gt; What you are proposing would require another party creating a new Genesis block, then convincing all clients around the world to accept them. Good luck with that, because a completely new block chain would wipe out my assets.

&gt; The 51% attack would only work on new blocks, not pre-existing blocks. Period. Unless Satoshi Nakomoto and Gavin Andresen are wrong about their own creation and this guy on Reddit knows more about it than either of them.

&gt; The thing about hashing is that it is incredibly easy to check the block chain against the genesis block, it takes almost no time. Generating new blocks take time and a lot of computing power.

&gt; I would suggest you read the white paper and read more about the 51% attack. I think your scenario is based on a faulty understanding of how BitCoin works. But I'm no expert, so I could be wrong.


Wrong. 

You can make a fork after *any* block, not just Genesis. Every block has several possible blocks that can follow it. This is what mining is, looking for one of the possible blocks that can follow, by finding a hash value for it that is lower than the difficulty level threshold. So any combination of transactions and possible hashes (determined by difficulty level) can be the next block! So when I say ""several"" I am talking about a number you and I can probably not imagine.

Your scenario in which only one followup block is possible would require a difficulty of 1 in 2^256. Good luck with that! 1.15792089 × 10^77 (or seventyseven zeros at the end) hashes would have to be calculated on average per 10 minutes to find a block. Oh I forgot forgot to divide by 2, that'll make it twice as easy! I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure about how many gigahashes per second would be required. 

Even then you ignore that you can pick different transactions to form a block (different clients mining might not even know about the same transactions). So you could still get different chains.

The same thing goes for miners. They try to add more blocks to the longest chain, because they'll obviously try to mine the block most likely for other to base their transactions on, otherwise the coins they find don't exist in the chain people base their transactions on.

You tell me to read the paper, but honestly, you don't understand bitcoin. There is no authority in bitcoin, there is noone saying ""this is good, or this is bad"". If I install a client today and connect it, it will simply start asking other clients for blocks, and when you make a transaction it will try to add it to the longest chain that's proven to be correct. Example: if you take all the clients that know about the last 2 blocks offline, the other clients will simply build another chain. If this is longer than 2 blocks, when the other clients (the ones that knew about the extra 2 blocks) come online again, they'll forget about their 2 blocks and go with the chain that's longest. What else are they supposed to do? Split the network into 2 economies? (note: no 51% computing required for this scenario either..)


The authors of bitcoin are very well aware of all this, and the whole thing is structured around making it hard for people to amass 51% of power (especially in the beginning).

I don't know if Bitcoin is viable but the author's arguments against it are pretty weak. The blocks are expensive to create by design - that's what secures the transactions. The coin generation is a side effect - a clever way to gradually seed the money into the system in a completely decentralized way as well as motivate people to throw their processing power into the pool.

Interestingly it looks like one of his counter example (DigiCash) is defunct exactly because it wasn't decentralized. With Bitcoin there isn't a central agency to take out. 

I also don't buy the argument against proof-of-work - the paper linked is about stopping spam. That's a completely different application of the concept - the legitimate mail and spam's POW requirements are in conflict. Bitcoin is designed so that the block generation ticks at a steady rate no matter how much processing power is involved. More is better really - it makes it that much less likely a Russian botnet wreaks havoc.

I'll read some of the other references provided later, but to me it seems like the author hasn't quite grokked what's going on here. Yes, the CPU usage seems extremely wasteful and it bugs me to. However that in no way affects the soundness of Bitcoin as an online currency.

1. Branched block chains where the main chain becomes a record of the number of BTC in each branch.  Branch work is done on a per fee basis.  BTC can flow into and out of the main block chain.  Branches would be created to handle specific types of transactions or regions of trade.  The weak point is in the movement of BTC from a branch back into the main block chain.  When BTC is moved in this manner, persons wishing to cause problems could lie and say that a BTC transaction is real when it is false, or fake when it is real... The rest of the network not having access to the branch block chain would not know if the next block in the main block chain is fake or real....  The consequence would not be a double spend, but rather an interruption of BTC processing on the main branch, while the network identifies the IP's that are attempting to cause a problem.  A mechanism would be required to isolate the IP's that are causing disruptions so they can be banned.

2. Allow third parties to create manage transactions.  This could be done where the third party manages the transactions into and out of the main branch (that everyone can see).  The third party could also manage separate block chains to be transparent about the transactions they are performing.  The drawback is that these third parties could still simply skip town with the funds in the main branch.  The advantage would be that if the third party is honest, everyone can see exactly what is happening.

No, you didn't. Sure, the government can print more money, but when you go to work and 'make money,' you are not producing money that didn't already exist -- the person who pays you no longer has the money that they give to you for working, and the money that *they* have is given to them by customers who purchase an item / service, and then *they* no longer have that money, etc etc.

About half of what this guy is saying actually matters or means anything. Saying 'printing money doesn't cause hyperinflation' is like saying 'guns don't kill people' without the conditional '... unless they're wielded by someone with the intent to kill.'

Although the bitcoin community probably has a disproportionate number of anti-government, tax-hating individuals (who probably evaded taxes even long before they owned any bitcoins), that is unlikely to be the case if bitcoin garners a much more significant user base. 

Secondly, transactions don't need to be traceable to enforce the tax laws in a reasonable way.

This is homo economicus level bullshit.

How can you say that when it is in fact my premise, and you're telling me that I cannot hold it without being some sort of conceited person who assumes knowledge? LOL listen to your bloody self.

Cheezus fucking christ. I am not stating anything else than empirical fact. I am not extrapolating to anything, unlike you who think you can prove the rules of interest by the fact that humans eat when they're hungry!

&gt;Which is not any way incompatible with what I'm doing, other than your assumption of duty. When Einstein formed theories he didn't HAVE to find a way to empirically test them. Other people can do that. There's no duty there.

Yeah, you're a regular Einstein alright. Only you have provided nothing in the sense of empirical research or falsification. In short, you're nothing like Einstein.

&gt;But regardless, I formed a general theory which is falsifiable. If you see empirically that humans in fact don't prefer an amount of marginal utility now to an equal amount of marginal utility later

When you can show me how you quantify ""marginal utility"" so that you can compare two values to see if they're equal, we can talk about you having a falsifiable theory. Until then, you have a theory that is built on nothing but air.

The fact that humans want to eat when they're hungry does not prove your economic edifices.

&gt;We observe that humans will prefer to maximise their quality of life and their standard of living.

Stop replying to stuff without having an actual point to make. What you said now is completely irrelevant, even if you can word it in a way that makes sense. Note: The above doesn't, because ""standard of living"" and ""quality of life"" are completely subjective and you have no way of knowing if someone is indeed ""maximizing"" them.

&gt;Grrrrr. I've already explained how it's not a cop out. I never said, 'well markets always work'. I said if you come to accept that a vibrant market can emerge then it would allow you to conclude that it would iron out the kinks.

We are discussing **if** a ""vibrant market can emerge that will iron out the kinks"" using the bitcoin currency. I posited an example showing that such a currency might cause systemic failure of such a market. From then on, you started talking about ""vibrant markets ironing out kinks"". I don't know why you did, I assumed it had something to do with the example I posited, but apparently it doesn't.

The more people lose their wallets (effectively removing those coins from the economy), the more the real value of Bitcoin increases for people who can manage not to misplace them.

You can picture it like this: imagine for the sake of simplicity that the US cuts off all contact with rest of the world, and the only currency available is USD. Now image the mints all shut down. Over time, the remaining bills in circulation are decreasing. So a candy bar that costs $1 today is only going to cost $0.50 or so in 2 years - because when everyone has smaller quantities of money, smaller quantities of money are worth more. The real value of $1 is increasing over time, relative to candy bars. This makes USD a good investment: if you hoard a stash of dollars in good condition, you will have more value of USD when you eventually spend them.

Yes, the money supply is an important factor, but it is not the sole driving factor for inflation or deflation. It's just one of many pressures acting on the currency's value. For example, as there are more competing currencies, worries, etc, the perceived value can change independent of the actual supply. If people truly see that the money is being hoarded, new merchants will avoid the currency in favor of others, thus lowering its value for transactions, thus requiring people to spend it in order to avoid their wealth losing value when people start dodging the currency. A wildly overpriced currency is a danger to all of its actual value and it absolutely should compel hoarders to bail before it implodes (thus loosening and spreading the wealth). I think we're seeing that currently with the latest prices.

It's actually an interesting experimental blend that is far more subtle and far harder to predict how it will behave long-term, though.

I don't know if Bitcoin is viable but the author's arguments against it are pretty weak. The blocks are expensive to create by design - that's what secures the transactions. The coin generation is a side effect - a clever way to gradually seed the money into the system in a completely decentralized way as well as motivate people to throw their processing power into the pool.

Interestingly it looks like one of his counter example (DigiCash) is defunct exactly because it wasn't decentralized. With Bitcoin there isn't a central agency to take out. 

I also don't buy the argument against proof-of-work - the paper linked is about stopping spam. That's a completely different application of the concept - the legitimate mail and spam's POW requirements are in conflict. Bitcoin is designed so that the block generation ticks at a steady rate no matter how much processing power is involved. More is better really - it makes it that much less likely a Russian botnet wreaks havoc.

I'll read some of the other references provided later, but to me it seems like the author hasn't quite grokked what's going on here. Yes, the CPU usage seems extremely wasteful and it bugs me to. However that in no way affects the soundness of Bitcoin as an online currency.

This is only a byproduct of prices initially being set in USD, and then converted to BTC based on the exchange rate (which isn't very robust, since it's based almost entirely on the going rate on MtGox). Once businesses are able to pay for at least some of their costs with bitcoin, they can price goods in bitcoin primarily which will remove (I believe) a lot of the price volatility.

Also, it's not a requirement of Bitcoin that your private keys (the only thing **you** need to keep available and secure) are stored on a personal computer. There is at least one member of the community working on a secure hardware device that stores keys and does the signing - the keys are never shared with an untrusted device.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

There is also a compromise solution -- you would hold your bitcoins in a private crypto wallet, but transfer a portion of them to a clearing house to do small scale transactions.

I wanted to convert as much of 50 USD from a debit card into BTC.  It's not a lot of money, so #bitcoin-otc probably would've been best, but I wanted it as soon as possible (*Hee-yaw!  Imma gonna get me in on this here bubble!*).

There's a fee that they passed on when I used Moneybookers to get money from my debit card to my Virwox account--reasonable enough.  And then there's a fee for exchanging USD to SLL.  And then there's a fee for exchanging SLL to BTC.  And then there's a fee for pulling the BTC out of Virwox and into my own Bitcoin wallet.  (Virwox won't directly convert USD to BTC; SLL is a mandatory middle step.)

Additionally, I couldn't spend all the USD in my Virwox account on SLL--they wouldn't let me enter a fractional amount of USD to spend (which was fractional due to the Moneybookers fee).  Once as much of my money as possible was in SLL, I couldn't spend all the SLL in my Virwox account on BTC--they wouldn't let me enter a fractional amount of BTC *to buy*.  (One BTC is worth about 7.5 USD, so that can be quite an overhead.)

So here's where my money went:

  * 50 USD in bank account.
  * Transfer 50 USD from bank via debit card and Moneybookers to my Virwox account.  Moneybookers takes 2.24 USD.  Virwox balance is 47.76 USD.  Cumulative loss: 2.24 USD
  * Exchange 47.76 USD to SLL.  Oops!  Can't, must be a whole number of USD.  I have to forfeit 0.76 USD to Virwox.  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD
  * Really exchange 47.00 USD to 12,107.20 SLL.  Rate of 257.60 SLL per USD--not the best rate in the world since I chose the market order option, which fills the order instantly.  Virwox collects a commission of 352.68 SLL (payable only in SLL, so that 0.76 USD in limbo won't help here).  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 352.68 SLL (totaling ~ 4.36 USD)
  * Exchange 11,754.52 SLL (the balance) to BTC.  Oops!  Must buy a whole number of BTC.  Forfeit 89.52 SLL to Virwox.  Cumulative loss: Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 442.20 SLL (totaling ~ 4.72 USD).
  * Really exchange 11,500 SLL to 5 BTC.  Rate of 2366 SLL per BTC; again, chose a market order.  Virwox collects a commission of 165 SLL.  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 607.20 SLL (totaling ~ 5.36 USD)
  * Send 5 BTC (the balance) from my Virwox account to my wallter.  Virwox collects 0.02 BTC commission.  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 607.20 SLL + 0.02 BTC (totaling ~ 5.54 USD).

So in the end, I spent more than 10% of my money in fees and bullshit overheads (the limbo balances of USD and SLL).

Do not recommend.

The target moves roughly every two weeks such that the average rate of people finding blocks is once every 10 minutes.  In this way, a block includes all of the transactions up until that block was successfully added to the block chain (if you change a transaction, it changes the merkle root, which changes the hash of the block, which means that it would be invalid (not below the target), so the block chain maintains consistency of the transactions accepted into the network.  The ""free money"" bit is that it is accepted practice to insert a ""coinbase transaction"" into the merkle root, which directs 50BTC to an address to which you have the private key, and a coinbase transaction alone does not need to have a source of bitcoins (all other transactions, to be accepted, need to have sources and destinations add up to the same amount of BTC.)",0,False,t1_c1ubjau,True,Bitcoin,t1_c1ubf7x,c1ubjau,0,agricocb,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427151852,1305549031

If the objective is globalization, BitCoin does fit well as a global currency.  It has some interesting properties that help globalization.

1. You cannot physically steel BitCoins.  In fact, attempting to do so could result in destruction of BitCoins and deflation.  You may be able to hack someone's computer and take the BitCoin wallet, but that is a lot less destructive than threatening or killing them.
2. Deflation will encourage slower growth.  This happens because people can sit on their appreciating BitCoins instead of working to avoid inflation.  Slower growth fits better with the environmental problems we are having with massive industrialization.
3. BitCoins have the potential to be ubiquitous.  As long as there is an internet connection, BitCoins can exist.  One could send money to anyone around the globe in a matter of minutes.  People in emerging nations would have a way to exchange value unencumbered banking structures and corruption. (Assuming infrastructure for internet or data cell phone service.)  Again, theft becomes difficult and the poor have a better chance of accumulating wealth.
4. People would have more faith in a decentralized uncontrolled money system.  This would spur smart growth instead of the steroid induced growth the world has seen thus far.  (Freedom is a great way to encourage innovation.)
5. Going to physical war would only destroy BitCoins and slow down economic production in both the attacking and defending countries.
6. Encouraging or allowing BitCoins to become a real currency would be seen as an indication to ""Gold Bugs"" and others in the Libertarian movement that the world powers are not interested in power for powers sake, but are rather interested in the advancement of world civilization.

If the objective is world hegemony, BitCoins would obviously be a threat.

Although the bitcoin community probably has a disproportionate number of anti-government, tax-hating individuals (who probably evaded taxes even long before they owned any bitcoins), that is unlikely to be the case if bitcoin garners a much more significant user base. 

Secondly, transactions don't need to be traceable to enforce the tax laws in a reasonable way.

t3_g9lti,0,3,3,"&gt;Who in the market is buying Bitcoins, and what do they see themselves doing with them?    
    
Mostly investor types (in bulk anyway). People think the value will go up (and due to the deflationary nature of the currency it's less risky than other typical investments) will buy some to sell later. For comparison, I spent £60 on coins, and bought in when the value per coin was 0.6. Also, people who wish to get into using bitcoin are better off buying than trying to mine with poor hardware: at this point it costs more for the electricity to try and mine (unless you are using a GPU).

I personally see myself providing bitcoin related webservices with these coins, and maybe I'll make some purchases. It's also a long term investment for me though.

&gt;How widespread is the use of GPU computing in Bitcoin mining, and how does that compare to its utilization rate in other potential applications?
    
Anyone whio is *successfully* mining above the cost for electricity is using GPUs. As for it's utilization rate, I can only really offer [this](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=4689.0 ""From the official forums"") thread as an answer, as I don't really mine (my roommate does though, and makes a profit despite his added share of the electricity bill :)

&gt; Why don't people create new blockchains starting from new roots, so that they can have tons of easy Bitcoins?
    
They could, I could start generating ""GigitrixCoins"" tomorrow. The problem is, that no-one accepts these as a currency. The currency only has value if people use it. You could easily see how this has other applications though: I could start an MMO that has realworld elements and uses an alternate blockchain, for instance. Let me stress: an alternate blockchain creates completely different currency.

&gt; Who enforces increases in difficulty?

Bitcoin is NOT like gold in alot of ways: 

Divisibility, remember bitcoin can go to eight decimal places unlike gold which is not easily divided, 

Portability, theres no reason why there couldn't be a credit card, NFD, RFID, or whatever tech you think of that could transfer bitcoins. there is even a guy that has developed QR codes (2d barcodes) that can be printed on paper and used disposably to transfer bitcoin, much like checks.

Control enough bitcoin nodes and you can print money. Furthermore, nobody will be able to detect it until you shut down your nodes.

&gt; Does the Bitcoin economy face risk of compromise from a single catastrophic event?

Yes, as long as the dishonest nodes continue to outperform the honest nodes. However, that's not required for a one time theft. If the attacker disables his nodes (or loses control of the botnet, for example), eventually the honest nodes' competing proof-of-work chain would surpass the attackers'. At this point, the attacker's fraudulent transaction would revert to the original, honest transaction.

The argument on incentive (given the attacker has greater CPU power, why not generate coins?) fails to convince me. Conceivably one single transaction could transfer more coins than one could generate in a limited amount of time. Those coins could be traded for government-backed currency or goods, in a subsequent transaction that appears legitimate. At that point, if the attacker stops the botnet or overwhelming CPU power, even if the illegitimate transaction is reversed, the attacker still has real world value. The original bitcoin owner gets their coins back, but the entity that provided goods or currency has their transaction reversed without recourse for retrieving the real-world goods.

This might be overly wordy; I didn't take the time to write a shorter note, just exploring here.

tl;dr: given sufficient CPU power, attackers can fake transactions for coins, cash in the coins, and even if they are detected, it's already too late. They can repeat this over and over. Or they can leave the CPU power on and never get detected.

&gt; Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an ""algorithm"" which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be ""mined"". Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?). To solve this second problem, the supply of Bitcoin is algorithmically limited, which is again good for early adopters.

The difficulty of mining increases (that is to say, the target decreases) as the total processing power of the network increases, as often as every two weeks, such that a block will be generated approximately every ten minutes.  If everyone tries to mine bitcoins all day consistently for two weeks, the network will adjust and the rate of bitcoin generation will be the same in the long run.

&gt; Known rate -- ok, I'm with you, predictable inflation, not necessarily desirable from an economic standpoint, but I'll go with it -- but decreasing rate? If you were designing a currency that was going to topple the world order, wouldn't you want it to look like this? Or at least have constant in rate of growth? Yes, of course you would, because that's the only way to actually accommodate more people using it.

Bitcoins are currently divisible into 8 decimal places.  If that is not enough, the protocol can be updated to accomodate for more divisions, and therefore, more people.

&gt; But Bitcoin is not designed to be a functioning currency, it's designed to enrich early adopters. Again, that is why it is a scam. Period.

The early adopters who have the most bitcoins do not determine its value, the people who want to trade for bitcoins do.  Also, the bitcoins the early adopters get from mining blocks is payment for supporting the network, and protecting it from malicious users.  This isn't ""free money"" in the sense of money earned without invested effort.

&gt; As a quick thought experiment, let's say demand for Bitcoin grew as more people found out about them. Well, you'd expect the price of Bitcoin in dollars to grow rapidly. Now assume I own one Bitcoin. I also have a dollar bill. I would like to purchase a Pepsi. Which one of those will I spend? Obviously the devaluing dollar gets spent before the skyrocketing Bitcoin.

Isn't the occurrance of a bubble a natural event when something new and exchangeable enters the market?  A bubble does not mean a scam or a destined failure.  However, this might be the first time this happens to a currency, which brings us to the next point.

&gt; The critical point here is that exchange rates might change, but they never go away completely. The term in economics is ""convertibility"". For Bitcoin to work as a currency, it would have to act as a predictable store of value, which means it needs to be easily convertible to all other stores of value depending on an individual's needs or wants. It needs to be a part of that tee-pee. It isn't.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem here is that because Bitcoin is completely decentralized, no one is completely invested in the long-term success of the system. No one is literally making the market, saying ""no matter what happens, I'll buy Bitcoins from you at some price"". I understand that there are ""exchanges"" floating around. Their commitment to this market is (in my opinion) not credible. Anyone and everyone can just pick up their ball and leave.

I'm not sure how to respond to this.  That's a good point.

&gt; More importantly, is there anyone that even CAN do that? When a bank collapses, the federal reserve can honor deposits by quite literally printing money and giving people their cash back if need be. That slight increase in expected inflation (maybe) is a small price to pay for avoiding a financial meltdown. In the bitcoin economy, that's literally  impossible. It's decentralized; it's a published algorithm. No one can change it, and even if they could, it's no one's job to do so. Anyone with a large stake in Bitcoin will be too busy trying to get their own money out to worry about systemic risk. 

The algorithm and protocol can be changed as needed.  Those who do the mining have a stake in the system and would be enticed to fix the issue.  Remember, once bitcoins stop being given out by blocks, miners will be funded by transaction fees.  Therefore, it is in their best interest to fix the algorithm and protocol as necessary.

t3_gdkbg,0,1,1,"&gt; If many nodes are taken offline for a short period, the generation difficulty remains the same, and the attacker doesn't get anything. The network will produce fewer blocks per hour, so reversing a transaction with 6 confirmations will take a very long time. Generators don't compete with each other.

I understand that generation (mining) isn't impacted, I'm curious about verification and the attacker's advantage. If a sustained event kept ""real"" clients off the network (say, erroring out) is there some threshold that can be passed after which they will not have the resources to go back and recompute all the havoc that the evil clients have done?

E.g. an attacker controls E nodes on the network. The DoS happens and removes all but E+(E-1) nodes from the network, so the attacker is now ""in control"". Is there a threshold after which the E nodes could outcompute verifications faster than the (E-1) ""real"" nodes, get those false verifications into Merkle Hashes so they are now ""solved"", and then slowly allow ""real"" nodes to rejoin the network?

Essentially, I'm curious if an early event disrupting the verification of transactions will have a cascading effect, even after E+1 nodes rejoin the network outside of the attacker's control. 

EDIT: I see from the link you posted that the Bitcoin source code contains a block hash that ""[locks in](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Generate_valid_blocks_with_a_lower_difficulty_than_normal)"" all previous transactions.

""Every few releases of Bitcoin, a recent block hash is hardcoded into the source code. Any blocks before that point can't be changed. An attacker starting at that point would have to reduce the difficulty, but this would require him to generate blocks at a much slower rate than once per 10 minutes. By the time he finally gets to a difficulty of 1, a new version of Bitcoin with an updated hardcoded block will probably have been released.""

According to [this table](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison) you can easily achieve 0.1 Mhash/W on CPU. (It depends on what your idle power consumption is, BTW, it is not taken into account in this table directly.)

According to [bitcoin generation calculator](http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php) one Mhash generate block (50 BTC worth for now) in 4590 days on average. Which is 0.000454 BTC/hour, which is `conv_rate * 0.000454 USD/hour` where `conv_rate` is USDs paid for one BTC.

OTOH to generate 1 Mhash you need to spend `0.001 / efficiency` `kW*h` of electricity (where efficiency is measured in Mhash/W) which costs `cost_of_1kWh * 0.001 /efficiency` USD.

You'll achieve break-even when `conv_rate * 0.000454 = cost_of_1kWh * 0.001 /efficiency`. Solution for `conv_rate`:

    conv_rate = 2.20 * costf_of_1kWh / efficiency

Solution for `cost_of_1kWh`:

    cost_of_1kWh = 0.454 * conv_rate * efficiency

Assuming efficiency 0.1 Mhash/W (CPU) you'll break even when 1 kWh costs 0.12 USD.

So we're talking around $3 million just in terms of hardware, but you also need to account for the cost of the data center, cooling, power supply, networking and engineering support.

For instance, the cost of supplying power to all that hardware would be over $1 million per month, without even accounting for cooling.

But maybe you could put together a data center powerful enough for $10 million. What then? The most you can do is reverse transactions, so if you want to recoup your $10m investment cost, you'll need to buy up at least $10m worth of bitcoins.

So you manage to buy up $10m worth of coins, and you now have $20m sunk into this venture. You can then sell off all these coins and then reverse the transactions so you can sell them *again*, recouping your losses through fraud.

Unfortunately for you, selling off a quarter of the market would immediately devalue the currency. You'd need to sell the money off gradually to prevent a market slump.

But *then* you have the problem of detection. It's going to be pretty obvious that you're screwing around with the block chain if suddenly long alternative branches start appearing, and people start screaming about their lost money. You also be losing a bunch of money in power and maintenance costs.

And therein lies another major problem; even *if* you had all that computing power, using it to reverse transactions would be a criminal act. You'd be charged under fraud and computer hacking laws if you were caught.

So its unlikely that someone would sink $20m into a venture to defraud a market worth only $40m, especially since the chance of making a profit and getting away with it seems rather slim.

If you were a hacker with a large enough botnet, then it *might* be worthwhile, but you'd only be able to scam a small fraction of the market before you were found out and people stopped sending you money. It would probably be more profitable to use your vast botnet for spam, DDOS attacks, etc.

Faith has no room in the financial world.

If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC. Instead, mention the vague concept of ""this new internet currency"" and give them a general description of the concept of BTC **without** mentioning the specific (and easily Googleable) word ""Bitcoin"". This is the approach I've taken with the handful of people I've recently decided to explain this concept to, and fortunately they both realized I knew exactly what I was talking about and that this ""internet currency"" is something I've secretly been investing in for a while.

Bottom line: Assume nothing about an individual until you have a fairly deep understanding of their ideologies, because that inadvertently is a huge factor when it comes to how they'll react to the concept of BTC.

t3_gyr9x,0,5,5,"I think they are interested because wide spread use of BitCoins would hamper governments ability to wage war.  This would drastically change the world power structure and shift warfare as we know it into an electronic domain.

If the objective is globalization, BitCoin does fit well as a global currency.  It has some interesting properties that help globalization.

1. You cannot physically steel BitCoins.  In fact, attempting to do so could result in destruction of BitCoins and deflation.  You may be able to hack someone's computer and take the BitCoin wallet, but that is a lot less destructive than threatening or killing them.
2. Deflation will encourage slower growth.  This happens because people can sit on their appreciating BitCoins instead of working to avoid inflation.  Slower growth fits better with the environmental problems we are having with massive industrialization.
3. BitCoins have the potential to be ubiquitous.  As long as there is an internet connection, BitCoins can exist.  One could send money to anyone around the globe in a matter of minutes.  People in emerging nations would have a way to exchange value unencumbered banking structures and corruption. (Assuming infrastructure for internet or data cell phone service.)  Again, theft becomes difficult and the poor have a better chance of accumulating wealth.
4. People would have more faith in a decentralized uncontrolled money system.  This would spur smart growth instead of the steroid induced growth the world has seen thus far.  (Freedom is a great way to encourage innovation.)
5. Going to physical war would only destroy BitCoins and slow down economic production in both the attacking and defending countries.
6. Encouraging or allowing BitCoins to become a real currency would be seen as an indication to ""Gold Bugs"" and others in the Libertarian movement that the world powers are not interested in power for powers sake, but are rather interested in the advancement of world civilization.

If the objective is world hegemony, BitCoins would obviously be a threat.

&gt;In finance, **speculation is a financial action that does not promise safety of the initial investment along with the return on the principal sum**. Speculation typically involves the lending of money for the purchase of assets, equity or debt but in a manner that has not been given thorough analysis or is deemed to have low margin of safety or a significant risk of the loss of the principal investment. The term, ""speculation,"" which is formally defined as above in Graham and Dodd's 1934 text, Security Analysis, **contrasts with the term ""investment,"" which is a financial operation that, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return**.

Would you say that putting one's money in bitcoin promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return? No? Then it's all speculation.

You don't need a third party to store your bitcoins. Storage of the coins is distributed over the network. The protocol was created with the concept in mind. As long as you have a secure backup of your wallet, you will be safe no matter what.

Remember that creating accounts and wallets are free and easy as running the app elsewhere. If you need to access some of your bitcoins anywhere other than the computer where the wallet is stored, you can transfer the coins to a temporary account in another computer. Transactions are free! There is no bank to charge your for that.

The important thing to remmeber is that, in the bitcoin market, you are your own banking institution. You are responsible for managing your own accounts and taking care of your own money. That's why HAVING A SECURE BACKUP OF YOUR WALLET IS EVERYTHING. If you loose the private keys in the wallet, the coins are lost forever. If anyone else other than you gets a hold of them, they can transfer the coins anywhere.

[EDIT1] For an early virtual economoy such as this, you're better off doing what most people did when they first started mining for gold. Keep them safe, somewhere only you know about.

The biggest mistake is he is making a false analogy to gold which, while many bitcoin supporters like, is not at all gold in so many ways its scary. 

Bitcoin is NOT like gold in alot of ways: 

Divisibility, remember bitcoin can go to eight decimal places unlike gold which is not easily divided, 

Portability, theres no reason why there couldn't be a credit card, NFD, RFID, or whatever tech you think of that could transfer bitcoins. there is even a guy that has developed QR codes (2d barcodes) that can be printed on paper and used disposably to transfer bitcoin, much like checks.

Statements like ""Believing in the gold standard is disbelieving in capitalism"" simply are just FUD. It sounds like ""MP3's are communism"" or ""Linux is communism"" or whatever crap you hear people saying.

However I would agree that ""In order to create currency, you have to do a bunch of pointless busywork"". It holds true for dollars or bitcoins, How many peoples jobs really matter? Well, like beauty, 'value' is in the eye of the beholder. For example I don't like mussels, If every mussel fisherman decided to stop, I could care less, does that mean mussels are without value? nope, but as far as I'm concerned they are. 

""Value"" is derived from some broad summation of peoples wants and people want a currency that is difficult (if not impossible) to trace and regulate outside of some basic rules (eg strict limitations on supply).

t3_he4ao,0,7,7,"One of my main interests in bitcoin is that it offers a way of doing business on the internet without having to go through a private entity.  Its the tendency of the internet to drive down prices to the absolute minimum... and frankly, in some cases I've had to can ideas because of the credit card fees.


I would be satisfied if governments would start creating virtual cash... and I would be even more satisfied if it was controlled by something higher than a countries government so I wouldn't have to arbitrary convert currencies.  Its somewhat paradoxical in my mind that we've managed to build layer upon layer of abstraction building an economy that is greater than the borders of our countries, but we still end up paying exchange fees.


The only unfortunate consequence, is I then have to trust a group of individuals to have ""my"" best interest in mind.  If the recent scandal with Strauss-Khan demonstrates anything, its that even the most trusted individuals are not perfect.  This I feel makes bitcoins decentralized nature an asset (as opposed to a weakness) Unfortunately though, that does not make his point about the issues related to decentralization any less true.

I'm guessing you're in finance.  My background is physics and comp sci so I probably model this a bit like an ass ... but my intuition is to model them like gold. I don't think they actually make a very good currency.

I think they have a very practical use for storing value into the future. They're superior to gold because they have lower transaction costs, rent and are safer and harder to steal. They're inferior because they have a shorter history and could go poof.

From what I can tell the value of gold has nothing to do with it's intrinsic value for industry or cosmetic properties, it's based on it's utility as a very safe wealth store.

Do you have an opinion on the best way to model the value of gold? There are a lot of kooks and theories about it but what method/model are big firms like Goldman Sachs using? http://www.thestreet.com/story/11051465/1/gold-prices-to-hit-1480-goldman.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN

I'm not at all confident bitcoins wont have their value spiral into nothing but at the moment libertarians love them and while there is a lot of speculation happening, I do think they have a decent chance of maintaining long term value.

So no simulation or anything that fancy. I just want to calculate the utility of bitcoins compared to other wealth stores and calculate what the possible values would likely to be after short term speculators loose interest.

*Current ""Default"" Rules for the regular Bitcoin client (Bitcoin 0.3.20)
0.01 BTC fee if sending any transaction less than 0.01 BTC. **This is to help prevent DoS attacks against the network.** Remember: fees are not network-enforced, so it's still possible to send these small transactions without the fee -- you just have to generate the blocks that contain them yourself (after modifying Bitcoin).*

*0.01 BTC fee per kilobyte of transaction, but:*

&gt;*If the blocksize (size of all transactions currently waiting to be included in a block) is less than 27 kB, transactions are free.*

&gt;*If the blocksize is more than 250 kB, transactions get increasingly more expensive as the blocksize approaches the limit of 500 kB. Sending a transaction when the blocksize is 400 kB will cost 5 times the normal amount; sending when it's 499 kB will cost 500x, etc.*

&gt;*Transactions within each fee tier are prioritized based on several factors. Most importantly, a transaction has more priority if the coins it is using have a lot of confirmations. Someone spamming the network will almost certainly be re-using the same coins, which will lower the priority of their transactions. Priority is also increased for transactions with more BTC, and reduced for transactions with more data.*

Even if it isn't illegal today, those in power will likely change the rules to protect their unearned privileges.  Not just with regard to bitcoins, but any public behavior that they find threatening.

So you make careful mental distinctions between your morality and the law and identify your own capacity for risk so that you can manage the changing landscape in a way that you feel at peace with.  

For instance we have the Constitutional right to engage in peaceful assembly, but obviously those in power find that very threatening - hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on Operation Earnest Voice whose sole purpose is to disrupt our online congress with sock puppet posters. If they change the rules so that speech is no longer free, will you still believe in free speech?  Will you still engage in the open expression of ideas that the state finds unsavory?  To the point of tear gas?  To the point of arrest?

Money is the means by which we hold the value of our efforts for a future date.  The people that we have entrusted with the stewardship of currency are stealing from the savers to fund their high living.  If they tell you tomorrow that you must use dollars - that you must allow them to steal from you - will you regard bitcoins and gold as morally wrong?  If not, will you risk storing your effort in some medium of exchange other than dollars?  If so what percentage?

That sounds like a lot, but you need something like a quadrillion hashes on average to solve a block. Napkin math, that's about 538 days, and that number will only increase as difficulty increases.

2) Any of the mining pools will do. Some don't require you to register, you just use your address as the username. Those might be considered easier but they normally take a bigger cut.

3) You can have any number of addresses stored in your wallet. An address is just a hash of a public key, which is itself derived from the private key.

t3_h13jo,0,5,5,"&gt; PHP's full-of-holes reputation is slightly undeserved.

Really? Then what do you need to actually 'deserve' it?

PHP was broken by design from the start. 

1. `register_globals` was a disaster, which they [admit](http://php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php) in the current documentation. You don't need to be a genius to foresee that it is a bad approach, this requires just a bit of thinking. (""How this can be exploited?"")

2. `magic quotes gpc` was a disaster too and they admit it.

3. PHP was used mostly with MySQL, but the first MySQL API did not have anything like query parameters, so it required escaping strings (see `maginc quotes gpc`) to avoid SQL injections. But it is hard to do escaping in the right places so it led to awful numbers of SQL injection vulnerabilities and shaped PHP's reputation. Note that if you use query parameters SQL injections are not possible by definition.

4. See above -- extremely bad security practices just few years ago.

So I don't know how it is possible to have a worse reputation aside from making it vulnerable intentionally.

Note that reputation is something which needs to be earned. If security practices would suddenly ideal that doesn't mean that people would start to trust PHP after all this bullshit which was happening years ago.

To rephrase it, let's say `bitcoinex` dude who confessed the MtGox DDoS would say he is sorry and will never do it again. Let's imagine he is sincere.

Would people trust him? Fucking NO.

It is extremely easy to stain your reputation and it is extremely hard to repair it.

There is no scalability problem. As the number of transactions increases, so too does the financial reward for solving a block.

Once blocks get sufficiently large, most desktop clients will begin to use the simplified payment verification method, instead of verifying the full block chain. The task of verifying the block chain would fall to supernodes.

&gt; Solutions with supernodes should explain how supernodes are harmless

There is no difference between a normal client in the bitcoin network today, and a supernode in a theoretically much larger bitcoin network.

It's important to realise that there wouldn't just be a handful of supernodes; there'd be hundreds of thousands. Transaction fees would ensure that anyone with sufficient hardware and bandwidth could turn a profit by running a supernode.

Theoretically, the network could be compromised if an attacker had access to over 50% of the supernodes, but the larger the bitcoin economy, the more money would be required to do that. By the time the bitcoin network has to handle 20ktps (assuming that ever happens), the economy will be so large that it would be extremely difficult for any one entity to find enough computing power to compromise the network. It would be even more difficult for an attacker to hide the fact that they control the majority of the bitcoin network.

&gt; For people who don't know a ton about FPGA stuff, you can run a hash engine natively in hardware using a hew hundred gates at most for MD5, and run one hash per clock cycle, with a clock speed of 5-550 Mhz.  Most of these chips have anywhere from 2000 gates for the barest of bare bones $50 DIY kits to about 9 million on the latest Virtex 7. 
Assuming the hash engine took 350 gates (2 orders of magnitude reliable), the chip runs at 550 MHz, and has 9 million gates, and was just 20% efficient, that is 80% of the time the chip is waiting for data or or otherwise not hashing, you could see about 2.8 trillion hashes per second.

1. The IRS only has the manpower to audit about 1% of all returns. What happens when half the population is buying more stuff than they earn in dollars? Remember that if this situation we are talking about takes place, the number of IRS agents will go down, due to declining government revenue. 

2. People who work for currently work for cash and make good incomes in black markets such as upper level illegal drug dealers, high end prostitutes, don't seem to have much of a problem hiding their consumption. I agree some people will get busted in a bitcoin economy for tax evasion based on their consumption, but those people won't even have dollars in the bank for the IRS to seize. This forces the IRS to resort to confiscate material goods and resell them, which is extremely time-consuming compared to transferring dollars from one bank account to another. 

2. There are literally tens of millions of people who do cash transactions every day without paying taxes and get away with it. That's the current situation _without_ bitcoin. 

3. The withholding system is the only reason the U.S. government can get away with confiscating so much money. How will withholding work when both the employer and employee decide to deal in bitcoins instead of dollars? It won't.

4. The IRS and all state-level tax collection agencies today rely on computerized forms and records, e.g. 1099s, bank account, etc to determine who might not be paying their ""fair share"". They will not have access to that type of information with bitcoins.

t3_h7xqb,0,1,1,"I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. So I'm going to assume you don't know anything about crypto, and explain from basics. Apologies in advance if I come across as patronizing.

So the idea of hashing is that you can take an arbitrary input, and convert it into a mostly-unique ""fingerprint"", that satisfies a few requirements.

1) A generated hash appears to be random, using statistical measures of such things

2) Given a hash, it is impossible to get the input data back

3) Finding two inputs that have the same hash should be very very very hard. (But not impossible)

As an aside, the reason #3 says ""not impossible"" is because of an incredibly simple concept that hoity-toity computer scientists call ""The pigeonhole principle"". Basically, for instance, if you have an 8-bit hash, then there are 256 different hashes that are possible. So give it 256 different inputs. Now give it 1 more. 257 different inputs are converted into 256 outputs; there is going to be at least one duplicate. The only reason this is not generally a problem is because we use very large numbers; the hash for bitcoin blocks is 256 bits, which means there are 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 different possible outputs.

Now, for a block to be valid, it has to be signed with a hash. However, in order to control the rate at which the blocks are generated, that hash must also have a numerical value less than the ""target"" (which is calculated from the difficulty, I can't remember how). Since hashes are supposed to act randomly, effectively what you're saying is ""when I generate a hash, it has a (target / 2^256) chance of being valid. If it's not valid, try again"". Because of statistics, and staggeringly large numbers, it works. 

The reason that these hashes can be used for validation is, again, the properties of a hash. If all you had was a hash, it would be effectively impossible to create a block that had that specific value for a hash. But if you already know what the block is, you can hash it (which is trivially fast; my $300 GFX card can calculate could hash the entire block chain 250ish times per second). So, what you can do is ask the official block history: ""What is the hash for this block that i have stored on my computer?"". The block history can say ""it's 8967234816473649781234612378423"". Then you can check. If it doesn't match, you know something fishy is going on

&gt; Yeah, you definitely can't do what you're saying. The clients aren't just looking for the longest block chain out there. The blocks that are created already exist and will exist for all of BitCoins existence.

&gt; What you are proposing would require another party creating a new Genesis block, then convincing all clients around the world to accept them. Good luck with that, because a completely new block chain would wipe out my assets.

&gt; The 51% attack would only work on new blocks, not pre-existing blocks. Period. Unless Satoshi Nakomoto and Gavin Andresen are wrong about their own creation and this guy on Reddit knows more about it than either of them.

&gt; The thing about hashing is that it is incredibly easy to check the block chain against the genesis block, it takes almost no time. Generating new blocks take time and a lot of computing power.

&gt; I would suggest you read the white paper and read more about the 51% attack. I think your scenario is based on a faulty understanding of how BitCoin works. But I'm no expert, so I could be wrong.


Wrong. 

You can make a fork after *any* block, not just Genesis. Every block has several possible blocks that can follow it. This is what mining is, looking for one of the possible blocks that can follow, by finding a hash value for it that is lower than the difficulty level threshold. So any combination of transactions and possible hashes (determined by difficulty level) can be the next block! So when I say ""several"" I am talking about a number you and I can probably not imagine.

Your scenario in which only one followup block is possible would require a difficulty of 1 in 2^256. Good luck with that! 1.15792089 × 10^77 (or seventyseven zeros at the end) hashes would have to be calculated on average per 10 minutes to find a block. Oh I forgot forgot to divide by 2, that'll make it twice as easy! I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure about how many gigahashes per second would be required. 

Even then you ignore that you can pick different transactions to form a block (different clients mining might not even know about the same transactions). So you could still get different chains.

The same thing goes for miners. They try to add more blocks to the longest chain, because they'll obviously try to mine the block most likely for other to base their transactions on, otherwise the coins they find don't exist in the chain people base their transactions on.

You tell me to read the paper, but honestly, you don't understand bitcoin. There is no authority in bitcoin, there is noone saying ""this is good, or this is bad"". If I install a client today and connect it, it will simply start asking other clients for blocks, and when you make a transaction it will try to add it to the longest chain that's proven to be correct. Example: if you take all the clients that know about the last 2 blocks offline, the other clients will simply build another chain. If this is longer than 2 blocks, when the other clients (the ones that knew about the extra 2 blocks) come online again, they'll forget about their 2 blocks and go with the chain that's longest. What else are they supposed to do? Split the network into 2 economies? (note: no 51% computing required for this scenario either..)


The authors of bitcoin are very well aware of all this, and the whole thing is structured around making it hard for people to amass 51% of power (especially in the beginning).

&gt; The 51% attack would only work on new blocks, not pre-existing blocks. Period. Unless Satoshi Nakomoto and Gavin Andresen are wrong about their own creation and this guy on Reddit knows more about it than either of them.

&gt; The thing about hashing is that it is incredibly easy to check the block chain against the genesis block, it takes almost no time. Generating new blocks take time and a lot of computing power.

&gt; I would suggest you read the white paper and read more about the 51% attack. I think your scenario is based on a faulty understanding of how BitCoin works. But I'm no expert, so I could be wrong.


Wrong. 

You can make a fork after *any* block, not just Genesis. Every block has several possible blocks that can follow it. This is what mining is, looking for one of the possible blocks that can follow, by finding a hash value for it that is lower than the difficulty level threshold. So any combination of transactions and possible hashes (determined by difficulty level) can be the next block! So when I say ""several"" I am talking about a number you and I can probably not imagine.

Your scenario in which only one followup block is possible would require a difficulty of 1 in 2^256. Good luck with that! 1.15792089 × 10^77 (or seventyseven zeros at the end) hashes would have to be calculated on average per 10 minutes to find a block. Oh I forgot forgot to divide by 2, that'll make it twice as easy! I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure about how many gigahashes per second would be required. 

Even then you ignore that you can pick different transactions to form a block (different clients mining might not even know about the same transactions). So you could still get different chains.

The same thing goes for miners. They try to add more blocks to the longest chain, because they'll obviously try to mine the block most likely for other to base their transactions on, otherwise the coins they find don't exist in the chain people base their transactions on.

You tell me to read the paper, but honestly, you don't understand bitcoin. There is no authority in bitcoin, there is noone saying ""this is good, or this is bad"". If I install a client today and connect it, it will simply start asking other clients for blocks, and when you make a transaction it will try to add it to the longest chain that's proven to be correct. Example: if you take all the clients that know about the last 2 blocks offline, the other clients will simply build another chain. If this is longer than 2 blocks, when the other clients (the ones that knew about the extra 2 blocks) come online again, they'll forget about their 2 blocks and go with the chain that's longest. What else are they supposed to do? Split the network into 2 economies? (note: no 51% computing required for this scenario either..)


The authors of bitcoin are very well aware of all this, and the whole thing is structured around making it hard for people to amass 51% of power (especially in the beginning).

t3_haoba,0,2,2,"&gt; There are only so many dollars in the world

This is not true. [Money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) can be measured in variety of way.

For example, monetary base is essentially all the stuff issued by the central bank: notes, coins and bank reserves on accounts in the central bank.

But M1 and M2 aggregates include also 1) demand deposits people/companies have in banks and 2) other types of deposits. While they no longer represent money central banks control, they better indicators for what is happening because people can use demand accounts in banks as money.

Next relevant thing is [quantity theory of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money) which provides a link between money in circulation and price levels. It turns out that amount of money in circulation is just one side of the story, another is velocity of money, i.e. how fast money is changing hands.

What this equation tells us is that if velocity drops prices will also drop even if amount of money in circulation stays the same. You can see this during recessions -- money do not suddenly evaporate, of course, but people buy less things and businesses do less transactions on bad expectations, so according to this equation prices drop (deflation) which cause further downturn (it makes sense to do less transactions). That's why central banks inflate money supply during recessions -- to compensate for falling velocity of money.

&gt; there'd be around 40 trillion of them floating around (a number rising all the time)

Where did you get this from? It is definitely not an amount of 'physical' dollars (including 'electronic' dollars in the Fed) because Fed's balance sheet is much smaller.

So you're taking into account demand deposits in banks, it seems.

t3_gz79a,0,2,2,"&gt; Relying on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

The only thing that measures marginal utility somewhat is money, and that measure shows us that people have a time preference for later just as well given equal amounts.

Sure, if you mentally ""calculate"" all the environmental variables so as to point that the marginal utility is ""equal"" and thus prove that the time preference for a specific marginal utility is on ""now"", you can theoretically make everything sounds plausible. But it's all a theoretical construct. You can't prove anything of what you suggest and just assert it because it sounds correct. It's not scientific at all and I am loathe to accept such an argument, given how flawed human edifices of pure logic are.

What we can empirically observe is that humans purchase various things, while others save money, and on occassion some pay in order to save money. You can't just declare what the motives of those purchases and savings are by asserting the premise of time preference because you're begging the question. First you need to prove time preference.

t3_h13jo,0,5,5,"&gt; PHP's full-of-holes reputation is slightly undeserved.

Really? Then what do you need to actually 'deserve' it?

PHP was broken by design from the start. 

1. `register_globals` was a disaster, which they [admit](http://php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php) in the current documentation. You don't need to be a genius to foresee that it is a bad approach, this requires just a bit of thinking. (""How this can be exploited?"")

2. `magic quotes gpc` was a disaster too and they admit it.

3. PHP was used mostly with MySQL, but the first MySQL API did not have anything like query parameters, so it required escaping strings (see `maginc quotes gpc`) to avoid SQL injections. But it is hard to do escaping in the right places so it led to awful numbers of SQL injection vulnerabilities and shaped PHP's reputation. Note that if you use query parameters SQL injections are not possible by definition.

4. See above -- extremely bad security practices just few years ago.

So I don't know how it is possible to have a worse reputation aside from making it vulnerable intentionally.

Note that reputation is something which needs to be earned. If security practices would suddenly ideal that doesn't mean that people would start to trust PHP after all this bullshit which was happening years ago.

To rephrase it, let's say `bitcoinex` dude who confessed the MtGox DDoS would say he is sorry and will never do it again. Let's imagine he is sincere.

Would people trust him? Fucking NO.

It is extremely easy to stain your reputation and it is extremely hard to repair it.

Which you cannot quantify in any way. Therefore you do not ""measure"" it.

NooooooooOOoOOOOoooo

This is homo economicus level bullshit.

&gt;But you JUST said, 'humans eat when their physical discomfort forces them to'. Humans... in general. How can you say that when it is in fact my premise, and you're telling me that I cannot hold it without being some sort of conceited person who assumes knowledge? LOL listen to your bloody self.

Cheezus fucking christ. I am not stating anything else than empirical fact. I am not extrapolating to anything, unlike you who think you can prove the rules of interest by the fact that humans eat when they're hungry!

&gt;Which is not any way incompatible with what I'm doing, other than your assumption of duty. When Einstein formed theories he didn't HAVE to find a way to empirically test them. Other people can do that. There's no duty there.

Yeah, you're a regular Einstein alright. Only you have provided nothing in the sense of empirical research or falsification. In short, you're nothing like Einstein.

&gt;But regardless, I formed a general theory which is falsifiable. If you see empirically that humans in fact don't prefer an amount of marginal utility now to an equal amount of marginal utility later

When you can show me how you quantify ""marginal utility"" so that you can compare two values to see if they're equal, we can talk about you having a falsifiable theory. Until then, you have a theory that is built on nothing but air.

The fact that humans want to eat when they're hungry does not prove your economic edifices.

&gt;We observe that humans will prefer to maximise their quality of life and their standard of living.

Stop replying to stuff without having an actual point to make. What you said now is completely irrelevant, even if you can word it in a way that makes sense. Note: The above doesn't, because ""standard of living"" and ""quality of life"" are completely subjective and you have no way of knowing if someone is indeed ""maximizing"" them.

&gt;Grrrrr. I've already explained how it's not a cop out. I never said, 'well markets always work'. I said if you come to accept that a vibrant market can emerge then it would allow you to conclude that it would iron out the kinks.

We are discussing **if** a ""vibrant market can emerge that will iron out the kinks"" using the bitcoin currency. I posited an example showing that such a currency might cause systemic failure of such a market. From then on, you started talking about ""vibrant markets ironing out kinks"". I don't know why you did, I assumed it had something to do with the example I posited, but apparently it doesn't. So excuse me for being confused on why you brought it up in the first place instead of addressing my example.

t3_h7ux6,0,2,2,"Correct.

&gt;The [difficulty](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block each 10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took more than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find.

The time taken to find 2016 blocks depends entirely on the computational resources of the Bitcoin network. 

However I suppose you could say that interest in Bitcoin mining (the **motivation to mine**, so to speak) is also driven by the value of the Bitcoin. With more value there is more interest, more miners, more computational resources, and thus more difficulty increases. As [posting_from_work said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/h7ux6/mtgox_value_hits_498usdbtc/c1t9xvh), it's a bit of a feedback loop. 

However I think the feedback loop has its limits. You won't see very many people jumping on board to mine with their CPUs at this difficulty. I'm guessing anything less than 20MH/s is probably questionable considering it would take &gt;1 year to earn a block at that speed. And don't forget that difficulty can (and [did](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/speed-ever.png)) decrease. The system of difficulty calculation appears to be self-correcting.

 Bitcoin will be harder to shut down as it is decentralized and the transactions happen between private entities. But the authorities can shut down the Exchange sites making it harder to convert the coins into cash. Everyone tries to sell at the same time and everything hits the shitter.

&gt;A raw version of that function that is not corrected for the expected increase in computing power. That is, a function with number of Bitcoins on the X axis and the amount of CPU cycles needed to generate the next Bitcoin on the Y axis.

That is the raw function. The FAQ says:

""The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.""

The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.

&gt;Amount of Bitcoins held by the ""wealthiest"" participants.

You cannot be sure. You can only ask people. Every transaction is public however so you could calculate with a program what is the Bitcoin address with the most money at a certain time.

BitCoin -&gt; tied to a unique number. It's also a deflationary currency, which is probably the only reason people are considering it to be valued as high as it is. There will reach a point when no more coins will be made.

ArtCoin -&gt; tied to a unique piece of artwork. Unless you are planning to limit the maximum number of coins here, it's probably going to be an inflationary currency. 

Basically, the reason BitCoin is gaining is because it's a strong signal that people are fed up with the Fed. The USD took on the losses from the bailouts, by moving those toxic assets from the banks, to the Reserve. Those assets haven't gone anywhere, and are unlikely to appreciate in value any time soon. The Euro is experiencing a similar signal, but for different reasons. 

People are tired of having their bank accounts raided, and their currencies plundered. They are tired of inflationary currencies that only make them poorer; they are tired of the various bad-faith accounting tricks we have seen employed recently, and they want to keep their money.

Keep in mind that the number of BitCoins being introduced to the system is around 50% for 2011 and around 33% for 2012, and then around 10% or less for the years thereafter. 

23 million is an incredibly small amount when taking into account the number of U.S. dollars (around 14 trillion).  So, how do you think BTC will be used?  Will BTC be used for a good portion of online transactions?  How about in person sales?

Here is an example of how I look at it.  I figure BTC will account for at least 1/10th of a percent (.1%) of the transactions in the U.S. in 3 to 4 years time.  So, figuring .1% of 14 trillion gives 14 billion.  Since there will be only 21 million BTC, I divide 14 billion by 21 million to give me a ball park idea of what bitcoins will be worth in the future.  14 billion divided by 21 million gives me about $670 per bitcoin.

* Every site owner would have to setup an account/ID for the BitCoin management. Many, many webmaster may not know about the program, those who know may not give a damn about it, and some may try to exploit it for their own gain.
* The potential risk for abuse is low if we're dealing with micro amounts, but it's still a possibility. Hell, if I had my own personal site set up with this theoretical API, even I might try writing a script to go through different IP addresses (proxies/VPNs/zombies) with different usernames to upvote different postings of my site. Really, just to see if I could accomplish such a thing. But if I would do it out of curiosity, someone else may do it with the intent of personal gain. And there's one more thing that comes to mind.
* How would this nano-sized currency be donated? By which I mean, would it come from the upvoter or would it be donated from the origin (BitCoin, which creates the coinage out of thin air). If it's the upvoter who donates, the API would have to be able to ask for or store (or perhaps even look-up from a database) the BitCoin ID of the upvoter. This isn't impossible, but it would take quite a bit of time to develop, test, and deploy. The increase in hassle would fight of the minuscule potential for abuse and it would also prevent unnecessary inflation. Speaking of which, if the nano BitCoin donation came directly BitCoin (as an award without a donor, basically) then it would slowly but surely increase the rate of inflation even more. And in the worse case scenario, if people start abusing it with scripts, more and more grows the inflation. **But..** That's only if the creators and managing coders of BitCoin would decide to get involved in such a venture. ;)

In theory it is [possible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker) to design poker game which does require a trusted party. I'm not sure if it is practical, though, as trust is not an issue with current sites, it seems.

Of course I agree that there are dangers in coming across like a pyramid scheme seller, or encouraging others to do so, but I have noticed that the bitcoin community, being made up of a lot of technology freaks and tinkerers is highly skewed toward the the more thoughtful and intelligent range of the human condition.

What I am saying is that we can and should be advocating bitcoin in a here-are-the-facts take-it-or-leave-it way. It seems to be that there are many people who will be interested in the information but not see the real potential in bitcoin and therefore not have much enthusiasm for it.

t3_fpt30,0,8,8,"well, for one, the bitcoin client only does CPU-based mining. If you have video card that is less than 3/4 years old, that's a few order of magnitude slower than what you'd get with a GPU miner.

Another neat side of GPU mining is that it leaves your CPU idle, and is designed to yield to other GPU-using stuff politely, so you can keep it running 24/7 while watching videos/gaming/whatever and not have to care too much. (some games may seem choppier under some conditions. you can always stop mining during your gaming session.)

if you check the forums on bitcoin.org, there should be a bunch of threads about GPU mining, including links to various miners you can download.

Miners run side-by-side with the bitcoin client (or in the case of a mining pool (like [Slush's pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/), standalone but chatting with the pooling server very regularly)

If nothing else, playing with GPU mining helped me realize the insane computing power my so-called video card contains (my oldish ATI 5770 can do a solid single-precision TeraFLOPS, which kinda blows my mind. In bitcoin terms, it computes 160 Mhash/s, where each hash consists of almost 2 full SHA-256 runs so that's over 300 million SHA-256/s. So that's kinda cool, and it keeps doing the regular video stuff while computing all that.)

As an aside, I'm still mining with my little 5770 as part of a pool. at the beginning of the year, I was getting 8 BTC a day. nowadays, it's closer to 3 BTC a day. My GPU consumes 280 Watts, running 24/7, that's ~ 6.7 kWh. My power company charges $0.052/kWh, so that means my 3 BTC/day cost about $0.35. At current rates, it's still worth doing. Hell, I just realized I'm basically mining enough BTCs to cover my entire electric bills so far.

So that's my little take on the whole ""mining ain't profitable"" concept. I'm really not doing it for the money, it's just something fun to waste GPU cycles on.

I'm guessing you're in finance.  My background is physics and comp sci so I probably model this a bit like an ass ... but my intuition is to model them like gold. I don't think they actually make a very good currency.

I think they have a very practical use for storing value into the future. They're superior to gold because they have lower transaction costs, rent and are safer and harder to steal. They're inferior because they have a shorter history and could go poof.

From what I can tell the value of gold has nothing to do with it's intrinsic value for industry or cosmetic properties, it's based on it's utility as a very safe wealth store.

Do you have an opinion on the best way to model the value of gold? There are a lot of kooks and theories about it but what method/model are big firms like Goldman Sachs using? http://www.thestreet.com/story/11051465/1/gold-prices-to-hit-1480-goldman.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN

I'm not at all confident bitcoins wont have their value spiral into nothing but at the moment libertarians love them and while there is a lot of speculation happening, I do think they have a decent chance of maintaining long term value.

So no simulation or anything that fancy. I just want to calculate the utility of bitcoins compared to other wealth stores and calculate what the possible values would likely to be after short term speculators loose interest.

I wanted to convert as much of 50 USD from a debit card into BTC.  It's not a lot of money, so #bitcoin-otc probably would've been best, but I wanted it as soon as possible (*Hee-yaw!  Imma gonna get me in on this here bubble!*).

There's a fee that they passed on when I used Moneybookers to get money from my debit card to my Virwox account--reasonable enough.  And then there's a fee for exchanging USD to SLL.  And then there's a fee for exchanging SLL to BTC.  And then there's a fee for pulling the BTC out of Virwox and into my own Bitcoin wallet.  (Virwox won't directly convert USD to BTC; SLL is a mandatory middle step.)

Additionally, I couldn't spend all the USD in my Virwox account on SLL--they wouldn't let me enter a fractional amount of USD to spend (which was fractional due to the Moneybookers fee).  Once as much of my money as possible was in SLL, I couldn't spend all the SLL in my Virwox account on BTC--they wouldn't let me enter a fractional amount of BTC *to buy*.  (One BTC is worth about 7.5 USD, so that can be quite an overhead.)

So here's where my money went:

  * 50 USD in bank account.
  * Transfer 50 USD from bank via debit card and Moneybookers to my Virwox account.  Moneybookers takes 2.24 USD.  Virwox balance is 47.76 USD.  Cumulative loss: 2.24 USD
  * Exchange 47.76 USD to SLL.  Oops!  Can't, must be a whole number of USD.  I have to forfeit 0.76 USD to Virwox.  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD
  * Really exchange 47.00 USD to 12,107.20 SLL.  Rate of 257.60 SLL per USD--not the best rate in the world since I chose the market order option, which fills the order instantly.  Virwox collects a commission of 352.68 SLL (payable only in SLL, so that 0.76 USD in limbo won't help here).  Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 352.68 SLL (totaling ~ 4.36 USD)
  * Exchange 11,754.52 SLL (the balance) to BTC.  Oops!  Must buy a whole number of BTC.  Forfeit 89.52 SLL to Virwox.  Cumulative loss: Cumulative loss: 3.00 USD + 442.20 SLL (totaling ~ 4.72 USD).

t3_g9lti,0,3,3,"&gt;Who in the market is buying Bitcoins, and what do they see themselves doing with them?    
    
Mostly investor types (in bulk anyway). People think the value will go up (and due to the deflationary nature of the currency it's less risky than other typical investments) will buy some to sell later. For comparison, I spent £60 on coins, and bought in when the value per coin was 0.6. Also, people who wish to get into using bitcoin are better off buying than trying to mine with poor hardware: at this point it costs more for the electricity to try and mine (unless you are using a GPU).

I personally see myself providing bitcoin related webservices with these coins, and maybe I'll make some purchases. It's also a long term investment for me though.

&gt;How widespread is the use of GPU computing in Bitcoin mining, and how does that compare to its utilization rate in other potential applications?
    
Anyone whio is *successfully* mining above the cost for electricity is using GPUs. As for it's utilization rate, I can only really offer [this](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=4689.0 ""From the official forums"") thread as an answer, as I don't really mine (my roommate does though, and makes a profit despite his added share of the electricity bill :)

&gt; Why don't people create new blockchains starting from new roots, so that they can have tons of easy Bitcoins?
    
They could, I could start generating ""GigitrixCoins"" tomorrow. The problem is, that no-one accepts these as a currency. The currency only has value if people use it. You could easily see how this has other applications though: I could start an MMO that has realworld elements and uses an alternate blockchain, for instance. Let me stress: an alternate blockchain creates completely different currency.

&gt; Who enforces increases in difficulty?

That part really doesn't need to be as long as it is. The whole reason behind the [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree) chosen to store the block chain is its ability to trim older transactions without impeding the ability to verify the validity of the chain.

The coins are (in my mind) little vaults with keyholes in them. Your bitcoin address (the long alphanumeric string) is the physical location of the vault, and your Bitcoin client contains a ""wallet.dat"" file which represents you set of keys for these vaults. If your PC goes boom and you didn't back up your bitcoin clients, the money stays in the vault but no-one has any keys! Since ""bitcoin locksmiths"" don't exist, the strong recommendation is to copy your keys and keep them somewhere else! You can do this by copying the wallet.dat file for backups. It's advised you do this regularly, since your client will get different keys after more transactions, so you want it all to be completely backed up.

&gt;i didnt setup an account or anything so how would i keep the bitcoins?

You don't have a named account (bitcoin people love anonymity) but there is one or more *address* as mentioned above that you can send and recieve bitcoins to. Only you have the keys to sign transactions using the coins you control, so that's how it works. The entire network knows that account X has Y coins, but we can't spend them or know anything about the identity of the person who can.

&gt;2nd questions is how to maximize bitcoin generation? i have a pretty good computer but dont really see any settings in the client to make it work harder

First of all, CPU mining is simply not profitable: you'll spend more on power than you'll ever earn. GPU mining (using your graphics cards rather than your processor) is the way to go. If you have the equipment, the better way to mine is by using a mining client: a piece of software designed to work with graphics cards and solely mine as efficiently as possible. Examples are [here](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1721.0), [here](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1334.0) and [here](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2444.0). They require a little knowledge of the command line on your operating system, but let me know if you have comments/questions.

The ""Generating"" option on the official client is so useless now in terms of successful generation that there was a forum thread discussing it's removal. Personally, I do not have the hardware to profitably mine, but I set my roommate up (he's a hardcore PC gamer with powerful graphics cards) and he's earned over 100 coins (and will be paying more than his share for electricity :D)",0,False,t1_c1o3e3y,True,Bitcoin,t1_c1nzqw3,c1o3e3y,0,gigitrix,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1428204406,1302108134
t3_gyr9x,0,2,2,"I was hoping that Bitcoin won't be officially recognized as a form of money and a payment system as long as possible.

If you look at it from technical perspective, it is just a cryptographic/network protocol to exchange cryptographic signatures in a way that guarantees certain invariants (scarcity). 

There is nothing about 'money' on the technical side, I think in theory system like this could be used for many things. Bitcoins have nothing to do with obligations of any sort, there is no central entity which controls them, they have no inherent value.

Even if it is recognized as a payment system it is not different from any in-game ""pretend money"", toy-money system (which also guarantees scarcity (otherwise game won't be interesting)), or just resources/bonuses/score etc.

I.e. if someone will create a peer-to-peer monopoly game its money would be similar to bitcoins.

But I'm sure government doesn't want to know about all these scarce-resources in game which in theory can be used as a currency.

So why does it want to know about Bitcoin?

I think that's just because Bitcoin is positioned as digital currency/payment system. People (particularly, developers) call it this way and so it is considered in this way.

This, of course, helps with economy growth, but also would allow gov't to ban it or take other actions as there are laws on money laundering, tax evasion, security exchanges and stuff like that.

So if I was trying to implement something like bitcoin from scratch I will try hard to split it into a general transaction processing core and a separate payment system. Then I would encourage uses which are not related to real money -- like use for in-game money (or, even better, other in-game resources which are not called money), name registration (see namecoin), maybe message exchange service and stuff like that. And only then I'd try to introduce 'real money' on top of this.

Then it would be harder for gov't to shut down core transaction processing system because it has both legitimate and illegitimate uses (just like anything else, e.g. official cash), cf. video recorders.

And, more importantly, I guess there would be different attitude, so maybe banning the thing won't even come up.

But if you talk about competing with fiat money from the start results would be different.

t3_gdkbg,0,1,1,"&gt; If many nodes are taken offline for a short period, the generation difficulty remains the same, and the attacker doesn't get anything. The network will produce fewer blocks per hour, so reversing a transaction with 6 confirmations will take a very long time. Generators don't compete with each other.

I understand that generation (mining) isn't impacted, I'm curious about verification and the attacker's advantage. If a sustained event kept ""real"" clients off the network (say, erroring out) is there some threshold that can be passed after which they will not have the resources to go back and recompute all the havoc that the evil clients have done?

E.g. an attacker controls E nodes on the network. The DoS happens and removes all but E+(E-1) nodes from the network, so the attacker is now ""in control"". Is there a threshold after which the E nodes could outcompute verifications faster than the (E-1) ""real"" nodes, get those false verifications into Merkle Hashes so they are now ""solved"", and then slowly allow ""real"" nodes to rejoin the network?

Essentially, I'm curious if an early event disrupting the verification of transactions will have a cascading effect, even after E+1 nodes rejoin the network outside of the attacker's control. 

EDIT: I see from the link you posted that the Bitcoin source code contains a block hash that ""[locks in](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Generate_valid_blocks_with_a_lower_difficulty_than_normal)"" all previous transactions. It seems significantly skilled attacker could wreak some serious havoc if they managed to both gain the 50% threshold AND compromise the main client github to change the hash to something they generated during their power trip. 

""Every few releases of Bitcoin, a recent block hash is hardcoded into the source code. Any blocks before that point can't be changed. An attacker starting at that point would have to reduce the difficulty, but this would require him to generate blocks at a much slower rate than once per 10 minutes. By the time he finally gets to a difficulty of 1, a new version of Bitcoin with an updated hardcoded block will probably have been released.""

Well that's what the Bitcoin guys keep saying on their wiki. Don't worry guys, it'll scale. _We just haven't figured out how to do it yet_. 

And they never will, because when you build a fully connected distributed system that uses global broadcast, you're not actually building a peer-to-peer system, you're building a _replicated server_. Which means you cannot cope with more transactions by adding more nodes, instead, you only make things worse. You can distribute a single node over multiple machines inside a datacentre, but that means the thing will be run by a federation of large corporations. 

It's only popular because it's a magic box that creates money out of thin air. 

&gt; Dismissing the whole thing as ""OMG IT IS A FUCKING SCAM, DON'T BE FOOLED"" is just... fucking retarded (lack of better words).

When something is too good to be true, it usually is. When there's money involved, it's probably a scam.

The question I have is... how would the network even know the coins are lost?!? And, for that matter, how would anyone know this to make all other bitcoins more valuable? If the owner can't use them anymore, they would basically be just sitting around in the network with the last transaction signed by this owner who no one can trace. They will still be there... it's just that no one else could use them.

Correct me if I am wrong... but I take the stand to say that some kind of ""keep-alive"" signal could be implemented. If the owner can access the coins, it should be able to, for example, update a timestamp on its last transaction to prove they are not lost. If this keep-alive is not updated for a reasonable human lifetime period (say, 60 or 80 years), then they could be officially considered lost and the last owner invalidated. Invalid lost coins could return the the market and people could still find them again in the form of mining.

The number of transactions in the main block chain will be limited to keep the size manageable.

The interface would have to change so that bitcoin only downloads the branch or branches you specify.  Further, branches would be broken down into ""trading regions"", where trades are more likely to happen within those regions.

By doing this, everyone will have the main block chain and one or two branches where their coins would be stored and where their transactions would likely happen, and the number of transactions per branch and trunk could be manageable.

The only drawback I see to this method is when coins traverse back to the main block chain.  Since not everyone has all the branches, a block on the main block chain showing coins coming from a branch could be attacked in such a way as to confuse those not having the appropriate branches, and the ones working on the main block chains would have to load up the branch chains to see which IP's were attempting to fake a transaction.

You shouldn't treat people whose intelligence level you're unaware of as intelligent-- instead, try to take the most neutral approach and over time you'll become very good at noticing the most subtle cues. Sounds ridiculous at first, but I'm sure you have an inkling of what I'm talking about. 

As for being optimistic about a person's ability to understand, again I would say that can lead to very undesirable results because believe it or not, your judgement about a person can be dead wrong and you're better off realizing that right away than later down the road because you were a nice guy. Again, I don't mean to sound like an asshole lol. Optimism is just another word for faith, and I make damn sure faith and my money stay the hell away from each other. Faith has no room in the financial world.

If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC. Instead, mention the vague concept of ""this new internet currency"" and give them a general description of the concept of BTC **without** mentioning the specific (and easily Googleable) word ""Bitcoin"". This is the approach I've taken with the handful of people I've recently decided to explain this concept to, and fortunately they both realized I knew exactly what I was talking about and that this ""internet currency"" is something I've secretly been investing in for a while.

Bottom line: Assume nothing about an individual until you have a fairly deep understanding of their ideologies, because that inadvertently is a huge factor when it comes to how they'll react to the concept of BTC.

This is homo economicus level bullshit.

&gt;But you JUST said, 'humans eat when their physical discomfort forces them to'. Humans... in general. How can you say that when it is in fact my premise, and you're telling me that I cannot hold it without being some sort of conceited person who assumes knowledge? LOL listen to your bloody self.

Cheezus fucking christ. I am not stating anything else than empirical fact. I am not extrapolating to anything, unlike you who think you can prove the rules of interest by the fact that humans eat when they're hungry!

&gt;Which is not any way incompatible with what I'm doing, other than your assumption of duty. When Einstein formed theories he didn't HAVE to find a way to empirically test them. Other people can do that. There's no duty there.

Yeah, you're a regular Einstein alright. Only you have provided nothing in the sense of empirical research or falsification. In short, you're nothing like Einstein.

&gt;But regardless, I formed a general theory which is falsifiable. If you see empirically that humans in fact don't prefer an amount of marginal utility now to an equal amount of marginal utility later

When you can show me how you quantify ""marginal utility"" so that you can compare two values to see if they're equal, we can talk about you having a falsifiable theory. Until then, you have a theory that is built on nothing but air.

The fact that humans want to eat when they're hungry does not prove your economic edifices.

&gt;We observe that humans will prefer to maximise their quality of life and their standard of living.

Stop replying to stuff without having an actual point to make. What you said now is completely irrelevant, even if you can word it in a way that makes sense. Note: The above doesn't, because ""standard of living"" and ""quality of life"" are completely subjective and you have no way of knowing if someone is indeed ""maximizing"" them.

&gt; No. There's a constant average rate of new Bitcoins created, and that amount is divided among the nodes by the CPU power they supply. The competition for coin creation will drive the price of electricity needed for generating a coin close to the value of the coin, so **the profit margin won't be that huge. The easier way to gain a lot of wealth would be trading goods.**

&gt; At the moment, though, you can generate new coins quite profitably, if you expect them to have real value in the future. If you choose to, be aware that Bitcoin is still experimental software.

Another neat side of GPU mining is that it leaves your CPU idle, and is designed to yield to other GPU-using stuff politely, so you can keep it running 24/7 while watching videos/gaming/whatever and not have to care too much. (some games may seem choppier under some conditions. you can always stop mining during your gaming session.)

if you check the forums on bitcoin.org, there should be a bunch of threads about GPU mining, including links to various miners you can download.

Miners run side-by-side with the bitcoin client (or in the case of a mining pool (like [Slush's pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/), standalone but chatting with the pooling server very regularly)

If nothing else, playing with GPU mining helped me realize the insane computing power my so-called video card contains (my oldish ATI 5770 can do a solid single-precision TeraFLOPS, which kinda blows my mind. In bitcoin terms, it computes 160 Mhash/s, where each hash consists of almost 2 full SHA-256 runs so that's over 300 million SHA-256/s. So that's kinda cool, and it keeps doing the regular video stuff while computing all that.)

As an aside, I'm still mining with my little 5770 as part of a pool. at the beginning of the year, I was getting 8 BTC a day. nowadays, it's closer to 3 BTC a day. My GPU consumes 280 Watts, running 24/7, that's ~ 6.7 kWh. My power company charges $0.052/kWh, so that means my 3 BTC/day cost about $0.35. At current rates, it's still worth doing. Hell, I just realized I'm basically mining enough BTCs to cover my entire electric bills so far.

So that's my little take on the whole ""mining ain't profitable"" concept. I'm really not doing it for the money, it's just something fun to waste GPU cycles on.

That sounds like a lot, but you need something like a quadrillion hashes on average to solve a block. Napkin math, that's about 538 days, and that number will only increase as difficulty increases.

t3_hf8cj,0,2,2,"Well, you are tying this theoretical currency to something. And that something will determine its worth.

BitCoin -&gt; tied to a unique number. It's also a deflationary currency, which is probably the only reason people are considering it to be valued as high as it is. There will reach a point when no more coins will be made.

ArtCoin -&gt; tied to a unique piece of artwork. Unless you are planning to limit the maximum number of coins here, it's probably going to be an inflationary currency. 

Basically, the reason BitCoin is gaining is because it's a strong signal that people are fed up with the Fed. The USD took on the losses from the bailouts, by moving those toxic assets from the banks, to the Reserve. Those assets haven't gone anywhere, and are unlikely to appreciate in value any time soon. The Euro is experiencing a similar signal, but for different reasons. 

People are tired of having their bank accounts raided, and their currencies plundered. They are tired of inflationary currencies that only make them poorer; they are tired of the various bad-faith accounting tricks we have seen employed recently, and they want to keep their money. Not its face value, but its real worth. 

At the end of the day, I still consider BitCoin a scam (and I'm mining ^_^ ). However, I am having trouble proving it's a true scam; and as such, I am playing around with it, hearing the arguments, until I am satisfied one way or the other. Worst case scenario is me having to pay an extra $20 (in electricity costs) for my experiment. Best case scenario is that I have a new toy (currency) to play with, that isn't being taxed yet, and doesn't require I go through any banks to acquire.

According to [this table](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison) you can easily achieve 0.1 Mhash/W on CPU. (It depends on what your idle power consumption is, BTW, it is not taken into account in this table directly.)

According to [bitcoin generation calculator](http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php) one Mhash generate block (50 BTC worth for now) in 4590 days on average. Which is 0.000454 BTC/hour, which is `conv_rate * 0.000454 USD/hour` where `conv_rate` is USDs paid for one BTC.

OTOH to generate 1 Mhash you need to spend `0.001 / efficiency` `kW*h` of electricity (where efficiency is measured in Mhash/W) which costs `cost_of_1kWh * 0.001 /efficiency` USD.

You'll achieve break-even when `conv_rate * 0.000454 = cost_of_1kWh * 0.001 /efficiency`. Solution for `conv_rate`:

    conv_rate = 2.20 * costf_of_1kWh / efficiency

Solution for `cost_of_1kWh`:

    cost_of_1kWh = 0.454 * conv_rate * efficiency

Assuming efficiency 0.1 Mhash/W (CPU) you'll break even when 1 kWh costs 0.12 USD.

Because of its finite supply. The number of USD should match the size of the US Economy, roughly. Otherwise you get a money crunch.

They can; the question is what this does to the market for Bitcoins. Maybe people only want to hold $100 in crypto-currencies, in which case introducing another means a smaller demand for Bitcoins.

http://www.bitcoin.org/sites/default/files/bitcoin.pdf

&gt;A raw version of that function that is not corrected for the expected increase in computing power. That is, a function with number of Bitcoins on the X axis and the amount of CPU cycles needed to generate the next Bitcoin on the Y axis.

That is the raw function. The FAQ says:

""The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.""

The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.

&gt;Amount of Bitcoins held by the ""wealthiest"" participants.

You cannot be sure. You can only ask people. Every transaction is public however so you could calculate with a program what is the Bitcoin address with the most money at a certain time.

&gt;Number of people participating in the Bitcoin p2p network over time.

For this you can just monitor the irc channel where all the nodes announce themselves I believe.

1. The IRS only has the manpower to audit about 1% of all returns. What happens when half the population is buying more stuff than they earn in dollars? Remember that if this situation we are talking about takes place, the number of IRS agents will go down, due to declining government revenue. 

2. People who work for currently work for cash and make good incomes in black markets such as upper level illegal drug dealers, high end prostitutes, don't seem to have much of a problem hiding their consumption. I agree some people will get busted in a bitcoin economy for tax evasion based on their consumption, but those people won't even have dollars in the bank for the IRS to seize. This forces the IRS to resort to confiscate material goods and resell them, which is extremely time-consuming compared to transferring dollars from one bank account to another. 

2. There are literally tens of millions of people who do cash transactions every day without paying taxes and get away with it. That's the current situation _without_ bitcoin. 

3. The withholding system is the only reason the U.S. government can get away with confiscating so much money. How will withholding work when both the employer and employee decide to deal in bitcoins instead of dollars? It won't.

4. The IRS and all state-level tax collection agencies today rely on computerized forms and records, e.g. 1099s, bank account, etc to determine who might not be paying their ""fair share"". They will not have access to that type of information with bitcoins.

You know you can make copies of your wallet and seed them on multiple machines. So long as you keep syncing the wallets every once in a while, it will work as expected.

Technical details: Your wallet file is a pool of N private keys (default 100). When you generate a new address, it uses the next private key in sequence to do so, then generates a new one to fill it back to 100. So, say I make a copy of my wallet, and put it on a second computer. Now I generate a new address on computer A. What it does is it uses the next key in sequence, and then puts a new address on the end of the pool. Now I generate a new address on computer B. It pulls the next key in sequence, WHICH IS THE SAME AS ON COMPUTER A, and then generates a new one for the pool, which is DIFFERENT FROM COMPUTER A.

&gt; What is about the fees you could set, I mean, yes, your ""information"" will be faster transmitted (proofed) but who will get the money? Random?

The fees go to whoever mines the block which contains your transaction. You don't have any control over it so yes, it is essentially random. By the way, transactions can't go any faster than about 10 minutes, regardless of fees. So usually offering fees will not make your transaction transmit faster.

&gt; You could not transmit a message with the ""money"" you send (as far as I know) but whats about adding a simple ""server"" to the Bitcoin client, like sendmail. So, at least an address could be associated with the money received ... (Would make webshops easier imho)

What? You mean a human-readable address instead of the current format?

&gt; rapid changing prices

Using the mtgox API you can transfer your bitcoins to USD the moment you receive them.

&gt;no clear future, and as far as I see, people just horde the Bitcoins instead of using them... What do you think about this?

You can't auto-correct for the cure for cancer. There would be no more proteins to fold. It's been cured. You'd need to tie the value of the bitcoin to something else, and get all clients to agree. If you want an autocorrect, then you would have to make the clients do useless work because by definition increasing the difficulty of a calculation arbitrarily is useless work.

Right now, it's calculating transactions + useless work. What you're proposing is calculating transactions+ curing cancer + useless work.

If you build a longer chain, they'll be ignored. If you control 51% of computing power, you'll eventually compute a longer chain.

&gt; Secondly, each mined block now rewards 50 BTC, by next year it will only reward 25 BTC per block. To get a million BTC would require a lot of power to make as many blocks as possible and then trick the network, all within the blink of an eye.

Doesn't matter. It's *not about mining*. If you can out calculate the network to create a longer alternate chain (for which you don't even need 51%, 51% is just the figure where according to calculations you are pretty much guaranteed to get what you want eventually).

That means you can effectively roll back transactions, after you've already converted the bitcoins in the transaction to something of value. This makes your arguments as to why people won't attack bitcoin:

&gt; If they rented those same servers and started mining BitCoins they would actually be able to gain a tremendous amount of BitCoins.

invalid, since this exploit could generate something of much greater value than you would get for mining. It's only limited by the speed at which you can transact bitcoins and get some other gain from them.

Sure. You could set up a P2P network where each peer broadcasts a bitcoin address. You pick an address at random, and then send a small amount (say, 0.10 BTC).

1. The IRS only has the manpower to audit about 1% of all returns. What happens when half the population is buying more stuff than they earn in dollars? Remember that if this situation we are talking about takes place, the number of IRS agents will go down, due to declining government revenue. 

2. People who work for currently work for cash and make good incomes in black markets such as upper level illegal drug dealers, high end prostitutes, don't seem to have much of a problem hiding their consumption. I agree some people will get busted in a bitcoin economy for tax evasion based on their consumption, but those people won't even have dollars in the bank for the IRS to seize. This forces the IRS to resort to confiscate material goods and resell them, which is extremely time-consuming compared to transferring dollars from one bank account to another. 

2. There are literally tens of millions of people who do cash transactions every day without paying taxes and get away with it. That's the current situation _without_ bitcoin. 

3. The withholding system is the only reason the U.S. government can get away with confiscating so much money. How will withholding work when both the employer and employee decide to deal in bitcoins instead of dollars? It won't.

4. The IRS and all state-level tax collection agencies today rely on computerized forms and records, e.g. 1099s, bank account, etc to determine who might not be paying their ""fair share"". They will not have access to that type of information with bitcoins.

This kind of attack is gonna rear its head in one form or another in any anonymous, fully peer-to-peer payment system.

The underlying problem is that you're relying on the nodes of a p2p network to maintain a payment history; the consensus opinion of all the nodes defines the ""truth"". But if you don't have a central authority that's assigning identities and deciding who can be a node in the network, then you'll always have the problem that a single powerful adversary can impersonate many nodes. Once he controls enough nodes, he can start tricking other nodes into believing different truths and can start double-spending his monies.

John Douceur wrote a [paper](http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/101.pdf) that laid out this problem and argued convincingly that there's no way to prevent someone from impersonating many nodes and launching a [Sybil attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). Like, you could say, ""one identity per IP address,"" but then a powerful adversary could come at you with a bunch of IPs in his quiver. You could say, ""one identity per X amount of computing power"" (the Bitcoin approach), but then someone with a truckload of video cards could attack you.

Economic history is not taught in econ programs so there is very little knowledge about the past, thus its tough to rebut today's orthodoxy. For example, I believe between the end of the Civil War and the late 19th century, the US money supply declined somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% or 70%. The population exploded, economic activity boomed, and the US became a world power in one of the greatest economic leaps in history -- all with a depreciating currency. Additionally, nineteenth century Britain experienced 50 years of falling prices, even though living standards rose at an unprecedented rate and level. From 1875 to 1895 wholesale prices fell by about 45 per cent while industrial output and real wages continued to rise. 

The ""problem"" with deflation in a fiat system is that deflation happens when debts are not paid, after all, money = debt. So if debts are written off, so is a portion of the money supply. On the other hand, in a bitcoin economy, deflation happens because the value of the currency rises out of supply/demand reasons, not debt defaults. In no small part this is a political problem, as much as an economic problem. 

Having bitcoins increase in value will encourage adoption of the system. Secondly, inflation can happen in a bitcoin economy, but only when the economy is contracting.

You don't need a third party to store your bitcoins. Storage of the coins is distributed over the network. The protocol was created with the concept in mind. As long as you have a secure backup of your wallet, you will be safe no matter what.

Remember that creating accounts and wallets are free and easy as running the app elsewhere. If you need to access some of your bitcoins anywhere other than the computer where the wallet is stored, you can transfer the coins to a temporary account in another computer. Transactions are free! There is no bank to charge your for that.

The important thing to remmeber is that, in the bitcoin market, you are your own banking institution. You are responsible for managing your own accounts and taking care of your own money. That's why HAVING A SECURE BACKUP OF YOUR WALLET IS EVERYTHING. If you loose the private keys in the wallet, the coins are lost forever. If anyone else other than you gets a hold of them, they can transfer the coins anywhere.

[EDIT1] For an early virtual economoy such as this, you're better off doing what most people did when they first started mining for gold. Keep them safe, somewhere only you know about.

t3_h6n28,0,2,2,"It all depends on how popular you think BitCoins will be in a years time.  The current number of BitCoins is around 6 million, and at $3.80 per BTC, that makes the current market capitalization of about 23 Million.  Keep in mind that the number of BitCoins being introduced to the system is around 50% for 2011 and around 33% for 2012, and then around 10% or less for the years thereafter. 

23 million is an incredibly small amount when taking into account the number of U.S. dollars (around 14 trillion).  So, how do you think BTC will be used?  Will BTC be used for a good portion of online transactions?  How about in person sales?

Here is an example of how I look at it.  I figure BTC will account for at least 1/10th of a percent (.1%) of the transactions in the U.S. in 3 to 4 years time.  So, figuring .1% of 14 trillion gives 14 billion.  Since there will be only 21 million BTC, I divide 14 billion by 21 million to give me a ball park idea of what bitcoins will be worth in the future.  14 billion divided by 21 million gives me about $670 per bitcoin.

I strongly disagree with this.

If nobody has suggested a viable solution yet it suggests that the problem is at least nontrivial. As such, it is negligent to wait for it to grow before putting serious effort into investigating solutions. For a currency to be stable people need to have confidence in it, and unresolved issues like this will undermine that.

Additionally, people often represent large changes to the fundamental implementation of BitCoin as something that's doable without too much effort. I read talk of having multiple networks interoperating as people transition from one system to the next. This strikes me as another issue which isn't being dealt with in sufficient depth. Although such as thing is certainly technically possible, there are possible problems, such as a lack of use on the old network causing the available computing power to drop significantly; I'm not knowledgeable enough to discuss the consequences this could have, but it seems like it could cause problems. I also think that such a change is the sort of thing that would confuse or worry enough people to damage confidence in BitCoin.

Because the exit node conveyed the non-Tor-encrypted message, and the entry node knew who the sender was, they were able to defeat the anonymity goal.

Control enough bitcoin nodes and you can print money. Furthermore, nobody will be able to detect it until you shut down your nodes.

&gt; Does the Bitcoin economy face risk of compromise from a single catastrophic event?

Yes, as long as the dishonest nodes continue to outperform the honest nodes. However, that's not required for a one time theft. If the attacker disables his nodes (or loses control of the botnet, for example), eventually the honest nodes' competing proof-of-work chain would surpass the attackers'. At this point, the attacker's fraudulent transaction would revert to the original, honest transaction.

The argument on incentive (given the attacker has greater CPU power, why not generate coins?) fails to convince me. Conceivably one single transaction could transfer more coins than one could generate in a limited amount of time. Those coins could be traded for government-backed currency or goods, in a subsequent transaction that appears legitimate. At that point, if the attacker stops the botnet or overwhelming CPU power, even if the illegitimate transaction is reversed, the attacker still has real world value. The original bitcoin owner gets their coins back, but the entity that provided goods or currency has their transaction reversed without recourse for retrieving the real-world goods.

This might be overly wordy; I didn't take the time to write a shorter note, just exploring here.

tl;dr: given sufficient CPU power, attackers can fake transactions for coins, cash in the coins, and even if they are detected, it's already too late. They can repeat this over and over. Or they can leave the CPU power on and never get detected.

No, you didn't. Sure, the government can print more money, but when you go to work and 'make money,' you are not producing money that didn't already exist -- the person who pays you no longer has the money that they give to you for working, and the money that *they* have is given to them by customers who purchase an item / service, and then *they* no longer have that money, etc etc.

So we're talking around $3 million just in terms of hardware, but you also need to account for the cost of the data center, cooling, power supply, networking and engineering support.

For instance, the cost of supplying power to all that hardware would be over $1 million per month, without even accounting for cooling.

But maybe you could put together a data center powerful enough for $10 million. What then? The most you can do is reverse transactions, so if you want to recoup your $10m investment cost, you'll need to buy up at least $10m worth of bitcoins.

So you manage to buy up $10m worth of coins, and you now have $20m sunk into this venture. You can then sell off all these coins and then reverse the transactions so you can sell them *again*, recouping your losses through fraud.

Unfortunately for you, selling off a quarter of the market would immediately devalue the currency. You'd need to sell the money off gradually to prevent a market slump.

But *then* you have the problem of detection. It's going to be pretty obvious that you're screwing around with the block chain if suddenly long alternative branches start appearing, and people start screaming about their lost money. You also be losing a bunch of money in power and maintenance costs.

And therein lies another major problem; even *if* you had all that computing power, using it to reverse transactions would be a criminal act. You'd be charged under fraud and computer hacking laws if you were caught.

So its unlikely that someone would sink $20m into a venture to defraud a market worth only $40m, especially since the chance of making a profit and getting away with it seems rather slim.

If you were a hacker with a large enough botnet, then it *might* be worthwhile, but you'd only be able to scam a small fraction of the market before you were found out and people stopped sending you money. It would probably be more profitable to use your vast botnet for spam, DDOS attacks, etc.

t3_h36b0,0,1,1,"&gt; i think the main weakness of bitcoin is it's lack of scalability

There is no scalability problem. As the number of transactions increases, so too does the financial reward for solving a block.

Once blocks get sufficiently large, most desktop clients will begin to use the simplified payment verification method, instead of verifying the full block chain. The task of verifying the block chain would fall to supernodes.

&gt; Solutions with supernodes should explain how supernodes are harmless

There is no difference between a normal client in the bitcoin network today, and a supernode in a theoretically much larger bitcoin network.

It's important to realise that there wouldn't just be a handful of supernodes; there'd be hundreds of thousands. Transaction fees would ensure that anyone with sufficient hardware and bandwidth could turn a profit by running a supernode.

Theoretically, the network could be compromised if an attacker had access to over 50% of the supernodes, but the larger the bitcoin economy, the more money would be required to do that. By the time the bitcoin network has to handle 20ktps (assuming that ever happens), the economy will be so large that it would be extremely difficult for any one entity to find enough computing power to compromise the network. It would be even more difficult for an attacker to hide the fact that they control the majority of the bitcoin network.

&gt; Yeah, you definitely can't do what you're saying. The clients aren't just looking for the longest block chain out there. The blocks that are created already exist and will exist for all of BitCoins existence.

&gt; What you are proposing would require another party creating a new Genesis block, then convincing all clients around the world to accept them. Good luck with that, because a completely new block chain would wipe out my assets.

&gt; The 51% attack would only work on new blocks, not pre-existing blocks. Period. Unless Satoshi Nakomoto and Gavin Andresen are wrong about their own creation and this guy on Reddit knows more about it than either of them.

&gt; The thing about hashing is that it is incredibly easy to check the block chain against the genesis block, it takes almost no time. Generating new blocks take time and a lot of computing power.

&gt; I would suggest you read the white paper and read more about the 51% attack. I think your scenario is based on a faulty understanding of how BitCoin works. But I'm no expert, so I could be wrong.


Wrong. 

You can make a fork after *any* block, not just Genesis. Every block has several possible blocks that can follow it. This is what mining is, looking for one of the possible blocks that can follow, by finding a hash value for it that is lower than the difficulty level threshold. So any combination of transactions and possible hashes (determined by difficulty level) can be the next block! So when I say ""several"" I am talking about a number you and I can probably not imagine.

Your scenario in which only one followup block is possible would require a difficulty of 1 in 2^256. Good luck with that! 1.15792089 × 10^77 (or seventyseven zeros at the end) hashes would have to be calculated on average per 10 minutes to find a block. Oh I forgot forgot to divide by 2, that'll make it twice as easy! I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure about how many gigahashes per second would be required. 

Even then you ignore that you can pick different transactions to form a block (different clients mining might not even know about the same transactions). So you could still get different chains.

The same thing goes for miners. They try to add more blocks to the longest chain, because they'll obviously try to mine the block most likely for other to base their transactions on, otherwise the coins they find don't exist in the chain people base their transactions on.

You tell me to read the paper, but honestly, you don't understand bitcoin. There is no authority in bitcoin, there is noone saying ""this is good, or this is bad"". If I install a client today and connect it, it will simply start asking other clients for blocks, and when you make a transaction it will try to add it to the longest chain that's proven to be correct. Example: if you take all the clients that know about the last 2 blocks offline, the other clients will simply build another chain. If this is longer than 2 blocks, when the other clients (the ones that knew about the extra 2 blocks) come online again, they'll forget about their 2 blocks and go with the chain that's longest. What else are they supposed to do? Split the network into 2 economies? (note: no 51% computing required for this scenario either..)

This kind of attack is gonna rear its head in one form or another in any anonymous, fully peer-to-peer payment system.

The underlying problem is that you're relying on the nodes of a p2p network to maintain a payment history; the consensus opinion of all the nodes defines the ""truth"". But if you don't have a central authority that's assigning identities and deciding who can be a node in the network, then you'll always have the problem that a single powerful adversary can impersonate many nodes. Once he controls enough nodes, he can start tricking other nodes into believing different truths and can start double-spending his monies.

John Douceur wrote a [paper](http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/101.pdf) that laid out this problem and argued convincingly that there's no way to prevent someone from impersonating many nodes and launching a [Sybil attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack).

Control enough bitcoin nodes and you can print money. Furthermore, nobody will be able to detect it until you shut down your nodes.

&gt; Does the Bitcoin economy face risk of compromise from a single catastrophic event?

Yes, as long as the dishonest nodes continue to outperform the honest nodes. However, that's not required for a one time theft. If the attacker disables his nodes (or loses control of the botnet, for example), eventually the honest nodes' competing proof-of-work chain would surpass the attackers'. At this point, the attacker's fraudulent transaction would revert to the original, honest transaction.

The argument on incentive (given the attacker has greater CPU power, why not generate coins?) fails to convince me. Conceivably one single transaction could transfer more coins than one could generate in a limited amount of time. Those coins could be traded for government-backed currency or goods, in a subsequent transaction that appears legitimate. At that point, if the attacker stops the botnet or overwhelming CPU power, even if the illegitimate transaction is reversed, the attacker still has real world value. The original bitcoin owner gets their coins back, but the entity that provided goods or currency has their transaction reversed without recourse for retrieving the real-world goods.

This might be overly wordy; I didn't take the time to write a shorter note, just exploring here.

tl;dr: given sufficient CPU power, attackers can fake transactions for coins, cash in the coins, and even if they are detected, it's already too late. They can repeat this over and over. Or they can leave the CPU power on and never get detected.

t3_haoba,0,2,2,"&gt; There are only so many dollars in the world

This is not true. [Money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) can be measured in variety of way.

For example, monetary base is essentially all the stuff issued by the central bank: notes, coins and bank reserves on accounts in the central bank.

But M1 and M2 aggregates include also 1) demand deposits people/companies have in banks and 2) other types of deposits. While they no longer represent money central banks control, they better indicators for what is happening because people can use demand accounts in banks as money.

Next relevant thing is [quantity theory of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money) which provides a link between money in circulation and price levels. It turns out that amount of money in circulation is just one side of the story, another is velocity of money, i.e. how fast money is changing hands.

What this equation tells us is that if velocity drops prices will also drop even if amount of money in circulation stays the same. You can see this during recessions -- money do not suddenly evaporate, of course, but people buy less things and businesses do less transactions on bad expectations, so according to this equation prices drop (deflation) which cause further downturn (it makes sense to do less transactions). That's why central banks inflate money supply during recessions -- to compensate for falling velocity of money.

&gt; there'd be around 40 trillion of them floating around (a number rising all the time)

Where did you get this from? It is definitely not an amount of 'physical' dollars (including 'electronic' dollars in the Fed) because Fed's balance sheet is much smaller.

So you're taking into account demand deposits in banks, it seems.

t3_gz79a,0,2,2,"&gt; Relying on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

There is also a compromise solution -- you would hold your bitcoins in a private crypto wallet, but transfer a portion of them to a clearing house to do small scale transactions. Then if clearing house goes rogue you would lose only a tiny portion of your savings.

&gt;The [difficulty](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block each 10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took more than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find.

The time taken to find 2016 blocks depends entirely on the computational resources of the Bitcoin network. 

However I suppose you could say that interest in Bitcoin mining (the **motivation to mine**, so to speak) is also driven by the value of the Bitcoin. With more value there is more interest, more miners, more computational resources, and thus more difficulty increases.

t3_haoba,0,2,2,"&gt; There are only so many dollars in the world

This is not true. [Money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) can be measured in variety of way.

For example, monetary base is essentially all the stuff issued by the central bank: notes, coins and bank reserves on accounts in the central bank.

But M1 and M2 aggregates include also 1) demand deposits people/companies have in banks and 2) other types of deposits. While they no longer represent money central banks control, they better indicators for what is happening because people can use demand accounts in banks as money.

Next relevant thing is [quantity theory of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money) which provides a link between money in circulation and price levels. It turns out that amount of money in circulation is just one side of the story, another is velocity of money, i.e. how fast money is changing hands.

What this equation tells us is that if velocity drops prices will also drop even if amount of money in circulation stays the same. You can see this during recessions -- money do not suddenly evaporate, of course, but people buy less things and businesses do less transactions on bad expectations, so according to this equation prices drop (deflation) which cause further downturn (it makes sense to do less transactions). That's why central banks inflate money supply during recessions -- to compensate for falling velocity of money.

&gt; there'd be around 40 trillion of them floating around (a number rising all the time)

Where did you get this from? It is definitely not an amount of 'physical' dollars (including 'electronic' dollars in the Fed) because Fed's balance sheet is much smaller.

So you're taking into account demand deposits in banks, it seems.

t3_hg9te,0,1,1,"This is always a fun debate.  I'll quote form the article to poke holes in his arguments.

&gt;""When the federal reserve 'prints money', it doesn't just mail million-dollar checks to random Americans.""

The process of earning Bitcoins for completing a block is not analogous to a central banking authority whimsically giving money to random individuals. (Also, this is PRECISELY what the mint did in 1849 when people spent their time and energy mining gold and getting paper money from the mint)

&gt;""Importantly, the people on the other end of those transactions did not just get free money.""

Neither dose an individual who completes a block.  Their computations cost them time/money/energy, and the benefit to the network as a whole is that BitCoin is more secure the more honest nodes there are.

&gt;""Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an 'algorithm' which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be 'mined'.""

This is the same as gold-backed currency (like the dollar you seem to be touting).  The only difference is that no one is in control of currency creation (then again, no one is in control of how much gold is in the Earth).

&gt;""Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?).""

To answer his last question, the solution has already occurred.  There now exist large mining ""pools"" where you can contribute calculations with your bitcoin client, and you get a share of the proceeds in a more steady rate over time.  (instead of having to wait to finish one block in a matter of years, you can get .01123127 BTC per day)

&gt;""Question: If your money is getting predictably more valuable, why would you want to spend it?""

Answer: Financial behaviors are (and should be) up to the individual.  People will spend money when they need/want things more than they want the money they have.  Haven't you ever heard of supply and demand?  And you're lecturing *us* on 'basic economics'?

&gt;""In the best case scenario [the one where it becomes popular] the limited supply of Bitcoin will cause crippling deflation, drying up most Bitcoin-denominated commerce save whatever speculative buying and selling happens on exchanges. Some new world order. All that transparency and all those low interchange fees aren't going to do you much good if you don't ever want to spend these things and no one wants to give them to you anyway.""

As deflation occurs, people won't 'spend less', they will use fewer Bitcoins for the same things they are doing every day.

If tomorrow you woke up, and there were half as many dollars in the world, AND everyone owned half as many as they did the day before (in some magical way), here's what will happen:

The McDonald's dollar menu will become the 50-cent menu.

Each of your dollars is worth twice as much, and you aren't willing to spend as much to buy the same things you enjoy (maybe you don't enjoy McDonalds, but it's just an example).

Since BitCoins are *very very* divisible, predictable, long term deflation doesn't make this a 'non-viable' currency.

The biggest mistake is he is making a false analogy to gold which, while many bitcoin supporters like, is not at all gold in so many ways its scary. 

Bitcoin is NOT like gold in alot of ways: 

Divisibility, remember bitcoin can go to eight decimal places unlike gold which is not easily divided, 

Portability, theres no reason why there couldn't be a credit card, NFD, RFID, or whatever tech you think of that could transfer bitcoins. there is even a guy that has developed QR codes (2d barcodes) that can be printed on paper and used disposably to transfer bitcoin, much like checks.

Statements like ""Believing in the gold standard is disbelieving in capitalism"" simply are just FUD. It sounds like ""MP3's are communism"" or ""Linux is communism"" or whatever crap you hear people saying.

However I would agree that ""In order to create currency, you have to do a bunch of pointless busywork"". It holds true for dollars or bitcoins, How many peoples jobs really matter?

Every 2 weeks the difficulty resets so that a new block is made every 10 minutes. So if a new block is being made every, say, 8 minutes, then there is 25% more computing power mining coins than there was two weeks ago. This only lasts until the difficulty reset (which is every 2 weeks).

Let's assume the computing power quadruples every year (really generous assumption). This means that at the end of every two week period there is 5% more computing power than there was at the beginning of the two week period. So blocks could be minted up to 5% faster than planned.

In general, though, you've convinced me that the threat of devaluation makes the ""big metal for double spending"" attack a risky, if not bad, investment: You might not be able to cash out before you destroy the currency. I think your best bet would be to trickle out the double spending slowly over many years; sporadic complaints of disappearing payments could be attributed to network partitions or who-knows-what, and the currency would shrug it off.

For profit-seekers, though, there are other ways than double spending to get a return on their big metal investment. Like, if the futures market gets big enough, someone could take a big short position in BTC, and then crash the value to zero.

Have you considered the effects of a shrinking money supply, caused by the rich's hoarding? As there as less gold chasing the same amount of goods, the purchasing power of all gold increased. This means that the poor were able to afford more goods than they otherwise would have.

Further, there is no deflationary spiral, because as the purchasing power of money increases, so does the incentive to spend it. An equilibrium point will be reached, since this functions as a negative feedback loop.

The only problem I see with deflation is that wages are sticky, people don't like to see that number fall. One possible solution is to tie wages to some basket of goods, so the amount paid in bitcoins fluctuates, but it always buys you the same amount of stuff.

For most people pooled mining has a higher expected value or higher long term payout.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Why_pooled_mining

Pooled mining makes sense when you account for changing difficulty. If you mine with a CPU or slow video card you should join a pool.

Because the difficulty rises about 2% per day, the correct model is a Poisson process where the rate is exponential decaying. You want to get paid as often as possible while the difficulty is increasing. 

If the difficulty were to stop increasing then it doesn't make any sense to be in a pool.

Lastly, the pools are all charing less than 3% and several are 1% or less.

------------------
[I'm wrong here as shadow dust pointed out. My apologies] 

The expected values are indeed the same. But for most people solo mining has a ~95% of never generating anything and pooled mining is virtually guaranteed to give you the EV - 0-3% depending on the pool.

6. When URL gets a significant amount of money, say 10 BTC URL owner get email which says that he have got a certain sum of money through this program and he can withdraw it in a certain way.

Problems I see with it:

1. One of biggest problem is that it is not P2P but service's owner basically operates an escrow service. So it there is a question of trust. But I see a lot of BitCoin services which work in this way -- MtGox, witcoin, MyBitCoin, YouTipIt -- so maybe it is not a huge problem. Besides that I've seen people are willing to give their BitCoins to strangers, so maybe it is not an issue.
I would love to make it fully P2P, but then it needs to work with BitCoin client to make it automatic. If thing gets popular -- why not? Just requires a lot more programming (+ some crypto, I guess).

2. Service might accumulate a lot of ""float"" from non-withdrawable donations.  I think it is possible to solve this issue by allowing donations to expire -- say, if sum was not withdrawed in a year or so donation amount is returned to donor, then it can re-use it. Or maybe it can be given to sites which get more upvotes so they have higher chances of accumulating a significant sum.

3. There is a problem with identifying site owner, but I think there are some ways to solve it. At beginning it can work manually.

4. I guess some sight owners will be reluctant to withdraw because they would think it is some kind of scam. But I hope that nicely written email which explains everything will convince them.

&gt; Every site owner would have to setup an account/ID for the BitCoin management. Many, many webmaster may not know about the program, those who know may not give a damn about it,

t3_hc82b,0,1,1,"&gt; doesn't seem too fair

Keep in mind the hashing isn't just a way to hand out bitcoins, it's also keeping the system itself working.  

From many comments I've read, most people are already at the point where the energy costs exceed or equal the payout.  Eventually bitcoin amounts will be smaller and farther between, and those who have the winning hash will earn more from transaction fees than from the bitcoin generation.

I'm not sure why the khash varies so much, mine stays pretty consistently +/- 10% when I watch it.  Keep in mind 5000 khash/s is mostly a sort of long shot lottery, as it would take on average 1565 days to win a hash at the current difficulty (which is very likely to go up significantly in the next two days).

Just for fun I have coin generation on with my desktop (set to use one cpu), but my primary interest isn't with mining.  What I'm probably going to do is use bitcoin to ""garage sale"" a bunch of stuff in my storage unit without all the eBay/paypal red tape and risks.  

I'd also like to see more sites offer tip jars for bitcoin, as that is a perfect application for it.

t3_hg9te,0,1,1,"This is always a fun debate.  I'll quote form the article to poke holes in his arguments.

&gt;""When the federal reserve 'prints money', it doesn't just mail million-dollar checks to random Americans.""

The process of earning Bitcoins for completing a block is not analogous to a central banking authority whimsically giving money to random individuals. (Also, this is PRECISELY what the mint did in 1849 when people spent their time and energy mining gold and getting paper money from the mint)

&gt;""Importantly, the people on the other end of those transactions did not just get free money.""

Neither dose an individual who completes a block.  Their computations cost them time/money/energy, and the benefit to the network as a whole is that BitCoin is more secure the more honest nodes there are.

&gt;""Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an 'algorithm' which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be 'mined'.""

This is the same as gold-backed currency (like the dollar you seem to be touting).  The only difference is that no one is in control of currency creation (then again, no one is in control of how much gold is in the Earth).

&gt;""Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?).""

To answer his last question, the solution has already occurred.  There now exist large mining ""pools"" where you can contribute calculations with your bitcoin client, and you get a share of the proceeds in a more steady rate over time.  (instead of having to wait to finish one block in a matter of years, you can get .01123127 BTC per day)

&gt;""Question: If your money is getting predictably more valuable, why would you want to spend it?""

Answer: Financial behaviors are (and should be) up to the individual.  People will spend money when they need/want things more than they want the money they have.  Haven't you ever heard of supply and demand?  And you're lecturing *us* on 'basic economics'?

&gt;""In the best case scenario [the one where it becomes popular] the limited supply of Bitcoin will cause crippling deflation, drying up most Bitcoin-denominated commerce save whatever speculative buying and selling happens on exchanges. Some new world order. All that transparency and all those low interchange fees aren't going to do you much good if you don't ever want to spend these things and no one wants to give them to you anyway.""

As deflation occurs, people won't 'spend less', they will use fewer Bitcoins for the same things they are doing every day.

If tomorrow you woke up, and there were half as many dollars in the world, AND everyone owned half as many as they did the day before (in some magical way), here's what will happen:

The McDonald's dollar menu will become the 50-cent menu.

Each of your dollars is worth twice as much, and you aren't willing to spend as much to buy the same things you enjoy (maybe you don't enjoy McDonalds, but it's just an example).

Since BitCoins are *very very* divisible, predictable, long term deflation doesn't make this a 'non-viable' currency.

1. The IRS only has the manpower to audit about 1% of all returns. What happens when half the population is buying more stuff than they earn in dollars? Remember that if this situation we are talking about takes place, the number of IRS agents will go down, due to declining government revenue. 

2. People who work for currently work for cash and make good incomes in black markets such as upper level illegal drug dealers, high end prostitutes, don't seem to have much of a problem hiding their consumption. I agree some people will get busted in a bitcoin economy for tax evasion based on their consumption, but those people won't even have dollars in the bank for the IRS to seize. This forces the IRS to resort to confiscate material goods and resell them, which is extremely time-consuming compared to transferring dollars from one bank account to another. 

2. There are literally tens of millions of people who do cash transactions every day without paying taxes and get away with it. That's the current situation _without_ bitcoin. 

3. The withholding system is the only reason the U.S. government can get away with confiscating so much money. How will withholding work when both the employer and employee decide to deal in bitcoins instead of dollars? It won't.

4. The IRS and all state-level tax collection agencies today rely on computerized forms and records, e.g. 1099s, bank account, etc to determine who might not be paying their ""fair share"". They will not have access to that type of information with bitcoins.

That part really doesn't need to be as long as it is. The whole reason behind the [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree) chosen to store the block chain is its ability to trim older transactions without impeding the ability to verify the validity of the chain.

As for the rest, the 1M user x 1 M transaction is 1T message, sure, but how many message will each user actually see? 1M. How many messages will at most be sent over a particular user's pipe? 1M * (1+bitcoin neighbors). For me right now, that'd be *9. Okay. Note that the bandwidth I consume on my side is only correlated to the number of transactions happening, not to the total number of users on the network.

So that doesn't sound quite as scary as your final verdict of unscalability, mostly because the load is fairly well distributed over the entire network.

Even if it isn't illegal today, those in power will likely change the rules to protect their unearned privileges.  Not just with regard to bitcoins, but any public behavior that they find threatening.

So you make careful mental distinctions between your morality and the law and identify your own capacity for risk so that you can manage the changing landscape in a way that you feel at peace with.  

For instance we have the Constitutional right to engage in peaceful assembly, but obviously those in power find that very threatening - hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on Operation Earnest Voice whose sole purpose is to disrupt our online congress with sock puppet posters. If they change the rules so that speech is no longer free, will you still believe in free speech?  Will you still engage in the open expression of ideas that the state finds unsavory?  To the point of tear gas?  To the point of arrest?

Money is the means by which we hold the value of our efforts for a future date.  The people that we have entrusted with the stewardship of currency are stealing from the savers to fund their high living.  If they tell you tomorrow that you must use dollars - that you must allow them to steal from you - will you regard bitcoins and gold as morally wrong?

If nobody has suggested a viable solution yet it suggests that the problem is at least nontrivial. As such, it is negligent to wait for it to grow before putting serious effort into investigating solutions. For a currency to be stable people need to have confidence in it, and unresolved issues like this will undermine that.

Additionally, people often represent large changes to the fundamental implementation of BitCoin as something that's doable without too much effort. I read talk of having multiple networks interoperating as people transition from one system to the next. This strikes me as another issue which isn't being dealt with in sufficient depth. Although such as thing is certainly technically possible, there are possible problems, such as a lack of use on the old network causing the available computing power to drop significantly; I'm not knowledgeable enough to discuss the consequences this could have, but it seems like it could cause problems. I also think that such a change is the sort of thing that would confuse or worry enough people to damage confidence in BitCoin.

Again, I don't mean to sound like an asshole lol. Optimism is just another word for faith, and I make damn sure faith and my money stay the hell away from each other.

If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC.

Network generates one block in approximately each 10 minutes.

It is rare and it is unlikely that somebody will pull this off, so I think one confirmation is enough for small sum transactions. Two confirmations to be really sure.

t3_g9lti,0,1,1,"&gt;I've downloaded the client and its ""generating"" apparently ... but if i shut off the computer or reinstall windows or my computer explodes where do all these bitcoins go? where are they stored?

The coins are (in my mind) little vaults with keyholes in them. Your bitcoin address (the long alphanumeric string) is the physical location of the vault, and your Bitcoin client contains a ""wallet.dat"" file which represents you set of keys for these vaults. If your PC goes boom and you didn't back up your bitcoin clients, the money stays in the vault but no-one has any keys! Since ""bitcoin locksmiths"" don't exist, the strong recommendation is to copy your keys and keep them somewhere else! You can do this by copying the wallet.dat file for backups. It's advised you do this regularly, since your client will get different keys after more transactions, so you want it all to be completely backed up.

&gt;i didnt setup an account or anything so how would i keep the bitcoins?

You don't have a named account (bitcoin people love anonymity) but there is one or more *address* as mentioned above that you can send and recieve bitcoins to. Only you have the keys to sign transactions using the coins you control, so that's how it works. The entire network knows that account X has Y coins, but we can't spend them or know anything about the identity of the person who can.

&gt;2nd questions is how to maximize bitcoin generation? i have a pretty good computer but dont really see any settings in the client to make it work harder

First of all, CPU mining is simply not profitable: you'll spend more on power than you'll ever earn. GPU mining (using your graphics cards rather than your processor) is the way to go. If you have the equipment, the better way to mine is by using a mining client: a piece of software designed to work with graphics cards and solely mine as efficiently as possible. Examples are [here](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1721.0), [here](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1334.0) and [here](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2444.0). They require a little knowledge of the command line on your operating system, but let me know if you have comments/questions.

The ""Generating"" option on the official client is so useless now in terms of successful generation that there was a forum thread discussing it's removal.

If you can break Bitcoin then the world has much bigger issues than problems with peer to peer currency.  The blogger brushes this point aside, but it's still true.  Breaking Bitcoin in a fundamental way requires tearing down the foundations of our current encryption technology.

Technical details: Your wallet file is a pool of N private keys (default 100). When you generate a new address, it uses the next private key in sequence to do so, then generates a new one to fill it back to 100. So, say I make a copy of my wallet, and put it on a second computer. Now I generate a new address on computer A. What it does is it uses the next key in sequence, and then puts a new address on the end of the pool. Now I generate a new address on computer B. It pulls the next key in sequence, WHICH IS THE SAME AS ON COMPUTER A, and then generates a new one for the pool, which is DIFFERENT FROM COMPUTER A.

This is only a byproduct of prices initially being set in USD, and then converted to BTC based on the exchange rate (which isn't very robust, since it's based almost entirely on the going rate on MtGox). Once businesses are able to pay for at least some of their costs with bitcoin, they can price goods in bitcoin primarily which will remove (I believe) a lot of the price volatility.

Also, it's not a requirement of Bitcoin that your private keys (the only thing **you** need to keep available and secure) are stored on a personal computer. There is at least one member of the community working on a secure hardware device that stores keys and does the signing - the keys are never shared with an untrusted device.

Also, you can encrypt and back up your wallet (the key storage for Bitcoin right now) to any number of services like Dropbox, Wuala, Gmail, Carbonite... whatever. Right now, this has to be done manually, but there will eventually be tools to automate this.

Because of its finite supply. The number of USD should match the size of the US Economy, roughly. Otherwise you get a money crunch.

&gt;A raw version of that function that is not corrected for the expected increase in computing power. That is, a function with number of Bitcoins on the X axis and the amount of CPU cycles needed to generate the next Bitcoin on the Y axis.

That is the raw function. The FAQ says:

""The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.""

The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.

&gt;Amount of Bitcoins held by the ""wealthiest"" participants.

You cannot be sure. You can only ask people. Every transaction is public however so you could calculate with a program what is the Bitcoin address with the most money at a certain time.

t3_gdkbg,0,1,1,"&gt; If many nodes are taken offline for a short period, the generation difficulty remains the same, and the attacker doesn't get anything. The network will produce fewer blocks per hour, so reversing a transaction with 6 confirmations will take a very long time. Generators don't compete with each other.

I understand that generation (mining) isn't impacted, I'm curious about verification and the attacker's advantage. If a sustained event kept ""real"" clients off the network (say, erroring out) is there some threshold that can be passed after which they will not have the resources to go back and recompute all the havoc that the evil clients have done?

E.g. an attacker controls E nodes on the network. The DoS happens and removes all but E+(E-1) nodes from the network, so the attacker is now ""in control"". Is there a threshold after which the E nodes could outcompute verifications faster than the (E-1) ""real"" nodes, get those false verifications into Merkle Hashes so they are now ""solved"", and then slowly allow ""real"" nodes to rejoin the network?

Essentially, I'm curious if an early event disrupting the verification of transactions will have a cascading effect, even after E+1 nodes rejoin the network outside of the attacker's control. 

EDIT: I see from the link you posted that the Bitcoin source code contains a block hash that ""[locks in](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Generate_valid_blocks_with_a_lower_difficulty_than_normal)"" all previous transactions. It seems significantly skilled attacker could wreak some serious havoc if they managed to both gain the 50% threshold AND compromise the main client github to change the hash to something they generated during their power trip. 

""Every few releases of Bitcoin, a recent block hash is hardcoded into the source code. Any blocks before that point can't be changed. An attacker starting at that point would have to reduce the difficulty, but this would require him to generate blocks at a much slower rate than once per 10 minutes. By the time he finally gets to a difficulty of 1, a new version of Bitcoin with an updated hardcoded block will probably have been released.""

2. `magic quotes gpc` was a disaster too and they admit it.

3. PHP was used mostly with MySQL, but the first MySQL API did not have anything like query parameters, so it required escaping strings (see `maginc quotes gpc`) to avoid SQL injections. But it is hard to do escaping in the right places so it led to awful numbers of SQL injection vulnerabilities and shaped PHP's reputation. Note that if you use query parameters SQL injections are not possible by definition.

4. See above -- extremely bad security practices just few years ago.

So I don't know how it is possible to have a worse reputation aside from making it vulnerable intentionally.

Note that reputation is something which needs to be earned. If security practices would suddenly ideal that doesn't mean that people would start to trust PHP after all this bullshit which was happening years ago.

To rephrase it, let's say `bitcoinex` dude who confessed the MtGox DDoS would say he is sorry and will never do it again. Let's imagine he is sincere.

Would people trust him? Fucking NO.

It is extremely easy to stain your reputation and it is extremely hard to repair it.

http://www.bitcoin.org/sites/default/files/bitcoin.pdf

&gt;A raw version of that function that is not corrected for the expected increase in computing power. That is, a function with number of Bitcoins on the X axis and the amount of CPU cycles needed to generate the next Bitcoin on the Y axis.

That is the raw function. The FAQ says:

""The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.""

The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.

&gt;Amount of Bitcoins held by the ""wealthiest"" participants.

You cannot be sure. You can only ask people. Every transaction is public however so you could calculate with a program what is the Bitcoin address with the most money at a certain time.

t3_h36b0,0,1,1,"&gt; i think the main weakness of bitcoin is it's lack of scalability

There is no scalability problem. As the number of transactions increases, so too does the financial reward for solving a block.

Once blocks get sufficiently large, most desktop clients will begin to use the simplified payment verification method, instead of verifying the full block chain. The task of verifying the block chain would fall to supernodes.

&gt; Solutions with supernodes should explain how supernodes are harmless

There is no difference between a normal client in the bitcoin network today, and a supernode in a theoretically much larger bitcoin network.

It's important to realise that there wouldn't just be a handful of supernodes; there'd be hundreds of thousands. Transaction fees would ensure that anyone with sufficient hardware and bandwidth could turn a profit by running a supernode.

Theoretically, the network could be compromised if an attacker had access to over 50% of the supernodes, but the larger the bitcoin economy, the more money would be required to do that. By the time the bitcoin network has to handle 20ktps (assuming that ever happens), the economy will be so large that it would be extremely difficult for any one entity to find enough computing power to compromise the network. It would be even more difficult for an attacker to hide the fact that they control the majority of the bitcoin network.

t3_gdkbg,0,1,1,"&gt; If many nodes are taken offline for a short period, the generation difficulty remains the same, and the attacker doesn't get anything. The network will produce fewer blocks per hour, so reversing a transaction with 6 confirmations will take a very long time. Generators don't compete with each other.

I understand that generation (mining) isn't impacted, I'm curious about verification and the attacker's advantage. If a sustained event kept ""real"" clients off the network (say, erroring out) is there some threshold that can be passed after which they will not have the resources to go back and recompute all the havoc that the evil clients have done?

E.g. an attacker controls E nodes on the network. The DoS happens and removes all but E+(E-1) nodes from the network, so the attacker is now ""in control"". Is there a threshold after which the E nodes could outcompute verifications faster than the (E-1) ""real"" nodes, get those false verifications into Merkle Hashes so they are now ""solved"", and then slowly allow ""real"" nodes to rejoin the network?

Essentially, I'm curious if an early event disrupting the verification of transactions will have a cascading effect, even after E+1 nodes rejoin the network outside of the attacker's control. 

EDIT: I see from the link you posted that the Bitcoin source code contains a block hash that ""[locks in](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Generate_valid_blocks_with_a_lower_difficulty_than_normal)"" all previous transactions.

""Every few releases of Bitcoin, a recent block hash is hardcoded into the source code. Any blocks before that point can't be changed. An attacker starting at that point would have to reduce the difficulty, but this would require him to generate blocks at a much slower rate than once per 10 minutes. By the time he finally gets to a difficulty of 1, a new version of Bitcoin with an updated hardcoded block will probably have been released.""

t3_hg9te,0,1,1,"This is always a fun debate.  I'll quote form the article to poke holes in his arguments.

&gt;""When the federal reserve 'prints money', it doesn't just mail million-dollar checks to random Americans.""

The process of earning Bitcoins for completing a block is not analogous to a central banking authority whimsically giving money to random individuals. (Also, this is PRECISELY what the mint did in 1849 when people spent their time and energy mining gold and getting paper money from the mint)

&gt;""Importantly, the people on the other end of those transactions did not just get free money.""

Neither dose an individual who completes a block.  Their computations cost them time/money/energy, and the benefit to the network as a whole is that BitCoin is more secure the more honest nodes there are.

&gt;""Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an 'algorithm' which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be 'mined'.""

This is the same as gold-backed currency (like the dollar you seem to be touting).  The only difference is that no one is in control of currency creation (then again, no one is in control of how much gold is in the Earth).

&gt;""Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?).""

To answer his last question, the solution has already occurred.  There now exist large mining ""pools"" where you can contribute calculations with your bitcoin client, and you get a share of the proceeds in a more steady rate over time.  (instead of having to wait to finish one block in a matter of years, you can get .01123127 BTC per day)

&gt;""Question: If your money is getting predictably more valuable, why would you want to spend it?""

Answer: Financial behaviors are (and should be) up to the individual.  People will spend money when they need/want things more than they want the money they have.  Haven't you ever heard of supply and demand?  And you're lecturing *us* on 'basic economics'?

&gt;""In the best case scenario [the one where it becomes popular] the limited supply of Bitcoin will cause crippling deflation, drying up most Bitcoin-denominated commerce save whatever speculative buying and selling happens on exchanges. Some new world order. All that transparency and all those low interchange fees aren't going to do you much good if you don't ever want to spend these things and no one wants to give them to you anyway.""

As deflation occurs, people won't 'spend less', they will use fewer Bitcoins for the same things they are doing every day.

If tomorrow you woke up, and there were half as many dollars in the world, AND everyone owned half as many as they did the day before (in some magical way), here's what will happen:

The McDonald's dollar menu will become the 50-cent menu.

Each of your dollars is worth twice as much, and you aren't willing to spend as much to buy the same things you enjoy (maybe you don't enjoy McDonalds, but it's just an example).

Since BitCoins are *very very* divisible, predictable, long term deflation doesn't make this a 'non-viable' currency.

Control enough bitcoin nodes and you can print money. Furthermore, nobody will be able to detect it until you shut down your nodes.

&gt; Does the Bitcoin economy face risk of compromise from a single catastrophic event?

Yes, as long as the dishonest nodes continue to outperform the honest nodes. However, that's not required for a one time theft. If the attacker disables his nodes (or loses control of the botnet, for example), eventually the honest nodes' competing proof-of-work chain would surpass the attackers'. At this point, the attacker's fraudulent transaction would revert to the original, honest transaction.

The argument on incentive (given the attacker has greater CPU power, why not generate coins?) fails to convince me. Conceivably one single transaction could transfer more coins than one could generate in a limited amount of time. Those coins could be traded for government-backed currency or goods, in a subsequent transaction that appears legitimate. At that point, if the attacker stops the botnet or overwhelming CPU power, even if the illegitimate transaction is reversed, the attacker still has real world value. The original bitcoin owner gets their coins back, but the entity that provided goods or currency has their transaction reversed without recourse for retrieving the real-world goods.

This might be overly wordy; I didn't take the time to write a shorter note, just exploring here.

tl;dr: given sufficient CPU power, attackers can fake transactions for coins, cash in the coins, and even if they are detected, it's already too late. They can repeat this over and over. Or they can leave the CPU power on and never get detected.

*Current ""Default"" Rules for the regular Bitcoin client (Bitcoin 0.3.20)
0.01 BTC fee if sending any transaction less than 0.01 BTC. **This is to help prevent DoS attacks against the network.** Remember: fees are not network-enforced, so it's still possible to send these small transactions without the fee -- you just have to generate the blocks that contain them yourself (after modifying Bitcoin).*

*0.01 BTC fee per kilobyte of transaction, but:*

&gt;*If the blocksize (size of all transactions currently waiting to be included in a block) is less than 27 kB, transactions are free.*

&gt;*If the blocksize is more than 250 kB, transactions get increasingly more expensive as the blocksize approaches the limit of 500 kB. Sending a transaction when the blocksize is 400 kB will cost 5 times the normal amount; sending when it's 499 kB will cost 500x, etc.*

&gt;*Transactions within each fee tier are prioritized based on several factors. Most importantly, a transaction has more priority if the coins it is using have a lot of confirmations. Someone spamming the network will almost certainly be re-using the same coins, which will lower the priority of their transactions. Priority is also increased for transactions with more BTC, and reduced for transactions with more data.*

Thus users will have to rely on powerful nodes which act as clearing houses of some sort.

If there are trusted clearing houses then you don't need that many transactions as clearing houses can settle transactions internally and use real bitcoin transactions only to settle final balances among themselves. 

I.e. consider [eWallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/EWallet)s like [MyBitcoin](http://www.mybitcoin.com/):

&gt; Transactions to a Bitcoin address from the same wallet provider are usually completed internally and, if so, will not be processed on the Bitcoin P2P network. Auditing tools such as the Block Explorer will not show any activity for this transaction. 
&gt; Some wallet providers allow amounts below 0.01 BTC to be sent if the transaction is to another account holder on the same service. This allows an inexpensive and immediate method to detect if the recipient is using the same wallet provider. For example, MyBitcoin will report an error when attempting to send an amount smaller than 0.01 BTC to a Bitcoin address that is not for another MyBitcoin account.

So I think use of ewallets or stuff like that would be pretty much inevitable whether you want it or not.

The only other option is to restructure protocols and, perhaps, cryptography to support divide-and-conquer algorithms of some sort. Maybe multiple block chains instead of a single monolithic one, with groups of nodes each responsible for its own chain.

So we're talking around $3 million just in terms of hardware, but you also need to account for the cost of the data center, cooling, power supply, networking and engineering support.

For instance, the cost of supplying power to all that hardware would be over $1 million per month, without even accounting for cooling.

But maybe you could put together a data center powerful enough for $10 million. What then? The most you can do is reverse transactions, so if you want to recoup your $10m investment cost, you'll need to buy up at least $10m worth of bitcoins.

So you manage to buy up $10m worth of coins, and you now have $20m sunk into this venture. You can then sell off all these coins and then reverse the transactions so you can sell them *again*, recouping your losses through fraud.

Unfortunately for you, selling off a quarter of the market would immediately devalue the currency. You'd need to sell the money off gradually to prevent a market slump.

But *then* you have the problem of detection. It's going to be pretty obvious that you're screwing around with the block chain if suddenly long alternative branches start appearing, and people start screaming about their lost money. You also be losing a bunch of money in power and maintenance costs.

And therein lies another major problem; even *if* you had all that computing power, using it to reverse transactions would be a criminal act. You'd be charged under fraud and computer hacking laws if you were caught.

So its unlikely that someone would sink $20m into a venture to defraud a market worth only $40m, especially since the chance of making a profit and getting away with it seems rather slim.

If you were a hacker with a large enough botnet, then it *might* be worthwhile, but you'd only be able to scam a small fraction of the market before you were found out and people stopped sending you money. It would probably be more profitable to use your vast botnet for spam, DDOS attacks, etc.

t3_gz79a,0,2,2,"&gt; Relying on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

There is also a compromise solution -- you would hold your bitcoins in a private crypto wallet, but transfer a portion of them to a clearing house to do small scale transactions.

No, you didn't.

Then because dollars would be passing through so few hands from issuance to redemption people would see the effects of the inflation tax far more clearly.  Right now i43% of the government's revenue comes from inflation.  That number is likely to increase.  So if it were 50% that means that the government spends $2 for every $1 that it takes in.  As long as the USD market is large this results in an inflation rate that isn't alarming, something in the single digits.

t3_he4ao,0,3,3,"I am not an economist but I'm gonna respond to the #1 post...

&gt; Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an ""algorithm"" which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be ""mined"". Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?). To solve this second problem, the supply of Bitcoin is algorithmically limited, which is again good for early adopters.

The difficulty of mining increases (that is to say, the target decreases) as the total processing power of the network increases, as often as every two weeks, such that a block will be generated approximately every ten minutes.  If everyone tries to mine bitcoins all day consistently for two weeks, the network will adjust and the rate of bitcoin generation will be the same in the long run.

&gt; Known rate -- ok, I'm with you, predictable inflation, not necessarily desirable from an economic standpoint, but I'll go with it -- but decreasing rate? If you were designing a currency that was going to topple the world order, wouldn't you want it to look like this? Or at least have constant in rate of growth? Yes, of course you would, because that's the only way to actually accommodate more people using it.

Bitcoins are currently divisible into 8 decimal places.  If that is not enough, the protocol can be updated to accomodate for more divisions, and therefore, more people.

&gt; But Bitcoin is not designed to be a functioning currency, it's designed to enrich early adopters. Again, that is why it is a scam. Period.

The early adopters who have the most bitcoins do not determine its value, the people who want to trade for bitcoins do.  Also, the bitcoins the early adopters get from mining blocks is payment for supporting the network, and protecting it from malicious users.  This isn't ""free money"" in the sense of money earned without invested effort.

&gt; As a quick thought experiment, let's say demand for Bitcoin grew as more people found out about them. Well, you'd expect the price of Bitcoin in dollars to grow rapidly. Now assume I own one Bitcoin. I also have a dollar bill. I would like to purchase a Pepsi. Which one of those will I spend? Obviously the devaluing dollar gets spent before the skyrocketing Bitcoin.

Isn't the occurrance of a bubble a natural event when something new and exchangeable enters the market?  A bubble does not mean a scam or a destined failure.  However, this might be the first time this happens to a currency, which brings us to the next point.

&gt; The critical point here is that exchange rates might change, but they never go away completely. The term in economics is ""convertibility"". For Bitcoin to work as a currency, it would have to act as a predictable store of value, which means it needs to be easily convertible to all other stores of value depending on an individual's needs or wants. It needs to be a part of that tee-pee. It isn't.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem here is that because Bitcoin is completely decentralized, no one is completely invested in the long-term success of the system. No one is literally making the market, saying ""no matter what happens, I'll buy Bitcoins from you at some price"". I understand that there are ""exchanges"" floating around. Their commitment to this market is (in my opinion) not credible. Anyone and everyone can just pick up their ball and leave.

I'm not sure how to respond to this.  That's a good point.

&gt; More importantly, is there anyone that even CAN do that? When a bank collapses, the federal reserve can honor deposits by quite literally printing money and giving people their cash back if need be. That slight increase in expected inflation (maybe) is a small price to pay for avoiding a financial meltdown. In the bitcoin economy, that's literally  impossible. It's decentralized; it's a published algorithm. No one can change it, and even if they could, it's no one's job to do so. Anyone with a large stake in Bitcoin will be too busy trying to get their own money out to worry about systemic risk. 

The algorithm and protocol can be changed as needed.  Those who do the mining have a stake in the system and would be enticed to fix the issue.  Remember, once bitcoins stop being given out by blocks, miners will be funded by transaction fees.  Therefore, it is in their best interest to fix the algorithm and protocol as necessary. The system is flexible, but we will have to see how well it fares against any challenges before we can determine if it is sufficiently resilient or not.",0,False,t1_c1upfr9,True,Bitcoin,t3_he4ao,c1upfr9,0,Ruzihm,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427158531,1305725736

I don't know if Bitcoin is viable but the author's arguments against it are pretty weak. The blocks are expensive to create by design - that's what secures the transactions. The coin generation is a side effect - a clever way to gradually seed the money into the system in a completely decentralized way as well as motivate people to throw their processing power into the pool.

Interestingly it looks like one of his counter example (DigiCash) is defunct exactly because it wasn't decentralized. With Bitcoin there isn't a central agency to take out. 

I also don't buy the argument against proof-of-work - the paper linked is about stopping spam. That's a completely different application of the concept - the legitimate mail and spam's POW requirements are in conflict. Bitcoin is designed so that the block generation ticks at a steady rate no matter how much processing power is involved. More is better really - it makes it that much less likely a Russian botnet wreaks havoc.

The branch block chain would work the same was as the main block chain, except that it would not generate new coins, those working on the branch block chain would only get coins by transaction fees.  The number of transactions in the main block chain will be limited to keep the size manageable.

The interface would have to change so that bitcoin only downloads the branch or branches you specify.  Further, branches would be broken down into ""trading regions"", where trades are more likely to happen within those regions.

By doing this, everyone will have the main block chain and one or two branches where their coins would be stored and where their transactions would likely happen, and the number of transactions per branch and trunk could be manageable.

The only drawback I see to this method is when coins traverse back to the main block chain.  Since not everyone has all the branches, a block on the main block chain showing coins coming from a branch could be attacked in such a way as to confuse those not having the appropriate branches, and the ones working on the main block chains would have to load up the branch chains to see which IP's were attempting to fake a transaction.

t3_hfv4a,0,7,7,"See, lets analyze the current system (fiat money). The money you're holding constantly lose value and thus force you to spend them fast. Saving is hard. This is the reason why you can't retire early and you have to work for your entire life if you're a common folk like I am.

In fiat money based economy, the economy grows, but resources are used very rapidly and people are over-spending, over-consuming. It's not surprising that the earth is getting more and more polluted and western countries go more and more in dept.

The only way to ""go forward"" in such economy for normal man is borrowing money. This makes most of the people economical slaves. Sure, you can buy shiny things in big quantities (things that other slaves produced), but you have to work almost whole life and give big share to what you earn to rich people ruling the system.


All the rich people controlling (actually having big influence on; no big conspiracy implied) the world are interested is keeping you and me in a hamster circle. You work, work, work, economy grows, economists are happy. There are many reasons for this: because country can have bigger armies, because economists believe it's good (all that modern economists are interested in is the entire market output), because politics and bankers have greater influence on everything in such system.

Also -- please note how ofter the argument is ""deflation is bad for debtors"". But why they have to be any debtors in the first place? Can't people just work and save like it used to be? You see -- ""people ruling the word"" are more or less kind of bankers. And they want you to want to be a debtor, because this secures their income at your cost.

Have you ever wondered why, despite all this economic growth there are still so many poor people, the rich are getting richer, even people that are doing well can't just work like ... one day in a week because they have already secured their future? Why we can spend so much on shiny shit, while whole countries are starving elsewhere? Where does the deforestation, pollution, etc. come from?

It's all because of overspending. And the fiat money is the reason. Yes, the economy grows with fiat money, but is it really the only thing we're interested in?

Let's see how it looks in deflationary economy.

First thing, you always have to buy some stuff. You want to eat? You have to buy it and the fact that tomorrow it will be 1% cheaper is not a big argument when you're hungry. If you require medical attention, you're not going to wait. You want to have your car repaired, you have to pay now or walk until you decide it's worth it. You can read this book next month, when it will be 10% ""cheaper"", but do you really want to wait?

Yes, people will spend less. You're not going to buy new TV just because new one is 3'' bigger and company creating TVs will not be able to do such large profts. But the fact that you didn't bought something is a good thing because someone else can use resources you didn't consumed to do something useful. And rise in value of your savings is a reward for patience. Thanks to you not consuming, economy grows, so grows the value of your savings.

In the price deflationary economy there are no banks (like we known today). They are not needed. If you want to invest, you just save from your work, postpone consumption and buy stuff you need for your investment cheaply (because other people didn't used them to create, buy and consume shiny toys). You don't need to get credit for your startup or business. You can work more, consume less and slowly but steady accumulate capital to invest. So there debts is not as wildly use in such economy.

The businesses in such economy are not like we see today. Companies are producing stuff that people really need and are willing to buy not because they have nothing else to spend their money on, but because it's really worth it. The economy is much, much smaller, but more lightweight for the environment. It grows slower, but in more ""we-need"" than ""we-desire"" way. People are consuming less, but can spend more time on things they're willing to do, or educating, reading, creating art or just giving their life a real meaning instead of attending ""whole-life-8h-per-day-race for consumption.

Bitcoin is not flawless, but it has the advantage of an enthusiastic and rapidly growing community supporting it. As time goes on, and more and more nodes and computing power back up the network, and more and more savy programmers scrutinize the code, the flaws should be minimized to the point where it is superior to any competing currency, all of which have flaws of their own.

As far as I can tell, the key feature of bitcoin is the use of *proof of work* to prevent double spending. This in turn relies on cryptographic techniques which create asymmetry or irreversibility. These features tie bitcoins to the physical world laws of energy (proof of work) and thermodynamics (irreversibility), which together give bitcoins their scarcity. 

Usually, the realm of pure information is immune to the limitations of the physical world, and data can be copied *ad infinitum*.

I would myself).

But there's also another thing we need to take into account, having a wider base isn't necessarily a good thing especially when the rate of supply remains the same. Higher demand with a lower supply means either one of two things:

1) Many people own small amounts of BTC in which case would be hard to sell goods.

2) Small set of people own large amounts of BTC, which again, would be hard to sell goods.

The branch block chain would work the same was as the main block chain, except that it would not generate new coins, those working on the branch block chain would only get coins by transaction fees.  The number of transactions in the main block chain will be limited to keep the size manageable.

The interface would have to change so that bitcoin only downloads the branch or branches you specify.  Further, branches would be broken down into ""trading regions"", where trades are more likely to happen within those regions.

By doing this, everyone will have the main block chain and one or two branches where their coins would be stored and where their transactions would likely happen, and the number of transactions per branch and trunk could be manageable.

The only drawback I see to this method is when coins traverse back to the main block chain.  Since not everyone has all the branches, a block on the main block chain showing coins coming from a branch could be attacked in such a way as to confuse those not having the appropriate branches, and the ones working on the main block chains would have to load up the branch chains to see which IP's were attempting to fake a transaction.

The branch block chain would work the same was as the main block chain, except that it would not generate new coins, those working on the branch block chain would only get coins by transaction fees.  The number of transactions in the main block chain will be limited to keep the size manageable.

The interface would have to change so that bitcoin only downloads the branch or branches you specify.  Further, branches would be broken down into ""trading regions"", where trades are more likely to happen within those regions.

By doing this, everyone will have the main block chain and one or two branches where their coins would be stored and where their transactions would likely happen, and the number of transactions per branch and trunk could be manageable.

The only drawback I see to this method is when coins traverse back to the main block chain.  Since not everyone has all the branches, a block on the main block chain showing coins coming from a branch could be attacked in such a way as to confuse those not having the appropriate branches, and the ones working on the main block chains would have to load up the branch chains to see which IP's were attempting to fake a transaction.

BitCoin -&gt; tied to a unique number. It's also a deflationary currency, which is probably the only reason people are considering it to be valued as high as it is. There will reach a point when no more coins will be made.

ArtCoin -&gt; tied to a unique piece of artwork. Unless you are planning to limit the maximum number of coins here, it's probably going to be an inflationary currency. 

Basically, the reason BitCoin is gaining is because it's a strong signal that people are fed up with the Fed. The USD took on the losses from the bailouts, by moving those toxic assets from the banks, to the Reserve. Those assets haven't gone anywhere, and are unlikely to appreciate in value any time soon. The Euro is experiencing a similar signal, but for different reasons. 

People are tired of having their bank accounts raided, and their currencies plundered. They are tired of inflationary currencies that only make them poorer; they are tired of the various bad-faith accounting tricks we have seen employed recently, and they want to keep their money.

&gt;A raw version of that function that is not corrected for the expected increase in computing power. That is, a function with number of Bitcoins on the X axis and the amount of CPU cycles needed to generate the next Bitcoin on the Y axis.

That is the raw function. The FAQ says:

""The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.""

The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.

t3_he4ao,0,3,3,"I am not an economist but I'm gonna respond to the #1 post...

&gt; Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an ""algorithm"" which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be ""mined"". Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?). To solve this second problem, the supply of Bitcoin is algorithmically limited, which is again good for early adopters.

The difficulty of mining increases (that is to say, the target decreases) as the total processing power of the network increases, as often as every two weeks, such that a block will be generated approximately every ten minutes.  If everyone tries to mine bitcoins all day consistently for two weeks, the network will adjust and the rate of bitcoin generation will be the same in the long run.

&gt; Known rate -- ok, I'm with you, predictable inflation, not necessarily desirable from an economic standpoint, but I'll go with it -- but decreasing rate? If you were designing a currency that was going to topple the world order, wouldn't you want it to look like this? Or at least have constant in rate of growth? Yes, of course you would, because that's the only way to actually accommodate more people using it.

Bitcoins are currently divisible into 8 decimal places.  If that is not enough, the protocol can be updated to accomodate for more divisions, and therefore, more people.

&gt; But Bitcoin is not designed to be a functioning currency, it's designed to enrich early adopters. Again, that is why it is a scam. Period.

The early adopters who have the most bitcoins do not determine its value, the people who want to trade for bitcoins do.  Also, the bitcoins the early adopters get from mining blocks is payment for supporting the network, and protecting it from malicious users.  This isn't ""free money"" in the sense of money earned without invested effort.

&gt; As a quick thought experiment, let's say demand for Bitcoin grew as more people found out about them. Well, you'd expect the price of Bitcoin in dollars to grow rapidly. Now assume I own one Bitcoin. I also have a dollar bill. I would like to purchase a Pepsi. Which one of those will I spend? Obviously the devaluing dollar gets spent before the skyrocketing Bitcoin.

Isn't the occurrance of a bubble a natural event when something new and exchangeable enters the market?  A bubble does not mean a scam or a destined failure.  However, this might be the first time this happens to a currency, which brings us to the next point.

&gt; The critical point here is that exchange rates might change, but they never go away completely. The term in economics is ""convertibility"". For Bitcoin to work as a currency, it would have to act as a predictable store of value, which means it needs to be easily convertible to all other stores of value depending on an individual's needs or wants. It needs to be a part of that tee-pee. It isn't.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem here is that because Bitcoin is completely decentralized, no one is completely invested in the long-term success of the system. No one is literally making the market, saying ""no matter what happens, I'll buy Bitcoins from you at some price"". I understand that there are ""exchanges"" floating around. Their commitment to this market is (in my opinion) not credible. Anyone and everyone can just pick up their ball and leave.

I'm not sure how to respond to this.  That's a good point.

&gt; More importantly, is there anyone that even CAN do that? When a bank collapses, the federal reserve can honor deposits by quite literally printing money and giving people their cash back if need be. That slight increase in expected inflation (maybe) is a small price to pay for avoiding a financial meltdown. In the bitcoin economy, that's literally  impossible. It's decentralized; it's a published algorithm. No one can change it, and even if they could, it's no one's job to do so. Anyone with a large stake in Bitcoin will be too busy trying to get their own money out to worry about systemic risk. 

The algorithm and protocol can be changed as needed.  Those who do the mining have a stake in the system and would be enticed to fix the issue.  Remember, once bitcoins stop being given out by blocks, miners will be funded by transaction fees.  Therefore, it is in their best interest to fix the algorithm and protocol as necessary.

Also, it's not a requirement of Bitcoin that your private keys (the only thing **you** need to keep available and secure) are stored on a personal computer. There is at least one member of the community working on a secure hardware device that stores keys and does the signing - the keys are never shared with an untrusted device.

Also, you can encrypt and back up your wallet (the key storage for Bitcoin right now) to any number of services like Dropbox, Wuala, Gmail, Carbonite... whatever. Right now, this has to be done manually, but there will eventually be tools to automate this.

Then because dollars would be passing through so few hands from issuance to redemption people would see the effects of the inflation tax far more clearly.  Right now i43% of the government's revenue comes from inflation.  That number is likely to increase.  So if it were 50% that means that the government spends $2 for every $1 that it takes in.  As long as the USD market is large this results in an inflation rate that isn't alarming, something in the single digits.

You shouldn't treat people whose intelligence level you're unaware of as intelligent-- instead, try to take the most neutral approach and over time you'll become very good at noticing the most subtle cues. Sounds ridiculous at first, but I'm sure you have an inkling of what I'm talking about. 

As for being optimistic about a person's ability to understand, again I would say that can lead to very undesirable results because believe it or not, your judgement about a person can be dead wrong and you're better off realizing that right away than later down the road because you were a nice guy. Again, I don't mean to sound like an asshole lol. Optimism is just another word for faith, and I make damn sure faith and my money stay the hell away from each other. Faith has no room in the financial world.

If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC. Instead, mention the vague concept of ""this new internet currency"" and give them a general description of the concept of BTC **without** mentioning the specific (and easily Googleable) word ""Bitcoin"". This is the approach I've taken with the handful of people I've recently decided to explain this concept to, and fortunately they both realized I knew exactly what I was talking about and that this ""internet currency"" is something I've secretly been investing in for a while.

Bottom line: Assume nothing about an individual until you have a fairly deep understanding of their ideologies, because that inadvertently is a huge factor when it comes to how they'll react to the concept of BTC.

You would have to keep a small balance of BTC on account while waiting for the payments to receive confirmations, but otherwise you would be converting all of your sales into USD.

t3_hh0g8,0,1,1,"&gt; Okay, so first of all, you can't retroactively take away validation of blocks. Verification takes all of ten minutes for a newly created block.

If you build a longer chain, they'll be ignored. If you control 51% of computing power, you'll eventually compute a longer chain.

&gt; Secondly, each mined block now rewards 50 BTC, by next year it will only reward 25 BTC per block. To get a million BTC would require a lot of power to make as many blocks as possible and then trick the network, all within the blink of an eye.

Doesn't matter. It's *not about mining*. If you can out calculate the network to create a longer alternate chain (for which you don't even need 51%, 51% is just the figure where according to calculations you are pretty much guaranteed to get what you want eventually).

That means you can effectively roll back transactions, after you've already converted the bitcoins in the transaction to something of value. This makes your arguments as to why people won't attack bitcoin:

&gt; If they rented those same servers and started mining BitCoins they would actually be able to gain a tremendous amount of BitCoins.

invalid, since this exploit could generate something of much greater value than you would get for mining. It's only limited by the speed at which you can transact bitcoins and get some other gain from them. The longer this takes the more work you'll have to do to calculate a longer chain (though you could start this process the moment you know the cut off point).

t3_gdkbg,0,1,1,"&gt; If many nodes are taken offline for a short period, the generation difficulty remains the same, and the attacker doesn't get anything. The network will produce fewer blocks per hour, so reversing a transaction with 6 confirmations will take a very long time. Generators don't compete with each other.

I understand that generation (mining) isn't impacted, I'm curious about verification and the attacker's advantage. If a sustained event kept ""real"" clients off the network (say, erroring out) is there some threshold that can be passed after which they will not have the resources to go back and recompute all the havoc that the evil clients have done?

E.g. an attacker controls E nodes on the network. The DoS happens and removes all but E+(E-1) nodes from the network, so the attacker is now ""in control"". Is there a threshold after which the E nodes could outcompute verifications faster than the (E-1) ""real"" nodes, get those false verifications into Merkle Hashes so they are now ""solved"", and then slowly allow ""real"" nodes to rejoin the network?

Essentially, I'm curious if an early event disrupting the verification of transactions will have a cascading effect, even after E+1 nodes rejoin the network outside of the attacker's control. 

EDIT: I see from the link you posted that the Bitcoin source code contains a block hash that ""[locks in](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Generate_valid_blocks_with_a_lower_difficulty_than_normal)"" all previous transactions. It seems significantly skilled attacker could wreak some serious havoc if they managed to both gain the 50% threshold AND compromise the main client github to change the hash to something they generated during their power trip. 

""Every few releases of Bitcoin, a recent block hash is hardcoded into the source code. Any blocks before that point can't be changed. An attacker starting at that point would have to reduce the difficulty, but this would require him to generate blocks at a much slower rate than once per 10 minutes. By the time he finally gets to a difficulty of 1, a new version of Bitcoin with an updated hardcoded block will probably have been released.""

The best miners can mine at around 700,000 Khash per second on the GPU.
Also, the more hashes put toward mining, the higher the difficulty. The system scales so that a block is discovered cracked every 10 minutes, no faster, no slower. 
Pools are a better bet, hundreds of people pooling their CPU and GPU clocks together to produce gigahashes per second... the one i'm using is around 140 Gigahash/s and when we crack a block it is divided amongst the participants (weighted to how many hashes per second you produce... and since i'm so low, i get a very low percent.) but ive still made maybe half a bitcoin in the past 4 days. :D ",0,False,t1_c1ujqyd,True,Bitcoin,t1_c1ujl2p,c1ujqyd,0,Nesetalis,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427155786,1305653298
t3_gybg4,0,2,2,"&gt;If you declare your income as $30k p.a., but then go out and buy a $100k sports car, the IRS is likely to sit up and notice.

1. The IRS only has the manpower to audit about 1% of all returns. What happens when half the population is buying more stuff than they earn in dollars? Remember that if this situation we are talking about takes place, the number of IRS agents will go down, due to declining government revenue. 

2. People who work for currently work for cash and make good incomes in black markets such as upper level illegal drug dealers, high end prostitutes, don't seem to have much of a problem hiding their consumption. I agree some people will get busted in a bitcoin economy for tax evasion based on their consumption, but those people won't even have dollars in the bank for the IRS to seize. This forces the IRS to resort to confiscate material goods and resell them, which is extremely time-consuming compared to transferring dollars from one bank account to another. 

2. There are literally tens of millions of people who do cash transactions every day without paying taxes and get away with it. That's the current situation _without_ bitcoin. 

3. The withholding system is the only reason the U.S. government can get away with confiscating so much money. How will withholding work when both the employer and employee decide to deal in bitcoins instead of dollars? It won't.

4. The IRS and all state-level tax collection agencies today rely on computerized forms and records, e.g. 1099s, bank account, etc to determine who might not be paying their ""fair share"". They will not have access to that type of information with bitcoins. 

In summary, bitcoin is an absolute nightmare for government tax collection.

Well that's what the Bitcoin guys keep saying on their wiki. Don't worry guys, it'll scale. _We just haven't figured out how to do it yet_. 

And they never will, because when you build a fully connected distributed system that uses global broadcast, you're not actually building a peer-to-peer system, you're building a _replicated server_. Which means you cannot cope with more transactions by adding more nodes, instead, you only make things worse. You can distribute a single node over multiple machines inside a datacentre, but that means the thing will be run by a federation of large corporations. 

It's only popular because it's a magic box that creates money out of thin air. 

&gt; Dismissing the whole thing as ""OMG IT IS A FUCKING SCAM, DON'T BE FOOLED"" is just... fucking retarded (lack of better words).

When something is too good to be true, it usually is. When there's money involved, it's probably a scam.

Feel free to debate my points if you will, but don't call me retarded simply because you don't understand my argumentation.

Economic history is not taught in econ programs so there is very little knowledge about the past, thus its tough to rebut today's orthodoxy. For example, I believe between the end of the Civil War and the late 19th century, the US money supply declined somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% or 70%. The population exploded, economic activity boomed, and the US became a world power in one of the greatest economic leaps in history -- all with a depreciating currency. Additionally, nineteenth century Britain experienced 50 years of falling prices, even though living standards rose at an unprecedented rate and level. From 1875 to 1895 wholesale prices fell by about 45 per cent while industrial output and real wages continued to rise. 

The ""problem"" with deflation in a fiat system is that deflation happens when debts are not paid, after all, money = debt. So if debts are written off, so is a portion of the money supply. On the other hand, in a bitcoin economy, deflation happens because the value of the currency rises out of supply/demand reasons, not debt defaults. In no small part this is a political problem, as much as an economic problem. 

Having bitcoins increase in value will encourage adoption of the system. Secondly, inflation can happen in a bitcoin economy, but only when the economy is contracting.

That part really doesn't need to be as long as it is. The whole reason behind the [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree) chosen to store the block chain is its ability to trim older transactions without impeding the ability to verify the validity of the chain.

How many messages will at most be sent over a particular user's pipe? 1M * (1+bitcoin neighbors). For me right now, that'd be *9. Okay.

If you look at it from technical perspective, it is just a cryptographic/network protocol to exchange cryptographic signatures in a way that guarantees certain invariants (scarcity). 

There is nothing about 'money' on the technical side, I think in theory system like this could be used for many things. Bitcoins have nothing to do with obligations of any sort, there is no central entity which controls them, they have no inherent value.

Even if it is recognized as a payment system it is not different from any in-game ""pretend money"", toy-money system (which also guarantees scarcity (otherwise game won't be interesting)), or just resources/bonuses/score etc.

I.e. if someone will create a peer-to-peer monopoly game its money would be similar to bitcoins.

But I'm sure government doesn't want to know about all these scarce-resources in game which in theory can be used as a currency.

So why does it want to know about Bitcoin?

I think that's just because Bitcoin is positioned as digital currency/payment system. People (particularly, developers) call it this way and so it is considered in this way.

This, of course, helps with economy growth, but also would allow gov't to ban it or take other actions as there are laws on money laundering, tax evasion, security exchanges and stuff like that.

So if I was trying to implement something like bitcoin from scratch I will try hard to split it into a general transaction processing core and a separate payment system. Then I would encourage uses which are not related to real money -- like use for in-game money (or, even better, other in-game resources which are not called money), name registration (see namecoin), maybe message exchange service and stuff like that. And only then I'd try to introduce 'real money' on top of this.

Then it would be harder for gov't to shut down core transaction processing system because it has both legitimate and illegitimate uses (just like anything else, e.g. official cash), cf. video recorders.

And, more importantly, I guess there would be different attitude, so maybe banning the thing won't even come up.

But if you talk about competing with fiat money from the start results would be different.

In general, though, you've convinced me that the threat of devaluation makes the ""big metal for double spending"" attack a risky, if not bad, investment: You might not be able to cash out before you destroy the currency. I think your best bet would be to trickle out the double spending slowly over many years; sporadic complaints of disappearing payments could be attributed to network partitions or who-knows-what, and the currency would shrug it off.

For profit-seekers, though, there are other ways than double spending to get a return on their big metal investment. Like, if the futures market gets big enough, someone could take a big short position in BTC, and then crash the value to zero. For enemies that just want to shut down Bitcoin, $3-5-10MM is a cheap price to achieve total destruction.

Either by making a longer chain yourself, or by making sure other clients don't know about any chains longer than yours (which will make them work for your chain, which can make it long enough to convince others too if they work faster).

Say for example I give you a million bitcoins. You give me 6 million dollars in return. Suppose you wait 15 minutes to let your bitcoins be confirmed (other clients saying they approve your blockchain) and then give me the dollars. Afterwards I convince everyone my own block-chain is better than yours (for example by briefly having enough computing power to generate a longer blockchain myself). Then I have 6 million dollars, and I still have a million bitcoins.

That's more than the ~27 bitcoins I could have mined during that time using my vast computing resources.

Of course these things are by no means forever a problem. Right now validity of the chain is by whomever reaches the most clients about having the longest chain. But this (and how this is done) is implementation specific. 

If in the future the majority of client also take input from a clearinghouse (an organization that ""clears"" part of the blockchain after a while) and refuse to use any chains that discard cleared blocks, than that'll be what is used. In that case when I send you a million coins you can wait till the clearinghouse has cleared it and be pretty sure all clients will follow that. 

I'm not saying this a solution that will or should happen, just that if it *does* that's how things would work then. Authority doesn't have to come from peer to peer distribution as it does now.",0,False,t1_c1vdon1,True,Bitcoin,t3_hh0g8,c1vdon1,0,lllama,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427170162,1306066571

Well to be fair, ""eventually"" is a fairly open-ended definition of ""impossible"", isn't it? I agree that open-source verification is critical for the success of something like Bitcoin, but since source repository compromise is in fact possible, and not unknown ([intentionally](http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-attack-full-report/) or [unintentionally](http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571)), wouldn't you agree that this is a potential weakpoint? 

The further discussion is ""how likely"" of course, and how feasible. You mention that E-1 couldn't do it. I meant to say, if an attacker controls E nodes, and E &gt; 50%, then (E-1) is the number of non-attacker nodes; I should probably be talking in percentages, I guess, because a node != a given amount of processing power.

BitCoin -&gt; tied to a unique number. It's also a deflationary currency, which is probably the only reason people are considering it to be valued as high as it is. There will reach a point when no more coins will be made.

ArtCoin -&gt; tied to a unique piece of artwork. Unless you are planning to limit the maximum number of coins here, it's probably going to be an inflationary currency. 

Basically, the reason BitCoin is gaining is because it's a strong signal that people are fed up with the Fed. The USD took on the losses from the bailouts, by moving those toxic assets from the banks, to the Reserve. Those assets haven't gone anywhere, and are unlikely to appreciate in value any time soon. The Euro is experiencing a similar signal, but for different reasons. 

People are tired of having their bank accounts raided, and their currencies plundered. They are tired of inflationary currencies that only make them poorer; they are tired of the various bad-faith accounting tricks we have seen employed recently, and they want to keep their money. Not its face value, but its real worth.

Sure, if you mentally ""calculate"" all the environmental variables so as to point that the marginal utility is ""equal"" and thus prove that the time preference for a specific marginal utility is on ""now"", you can theoretically make everything sounds plausible. But it's all a theoretical construct. You can't prove anything of what you suggest and just assert it because it sounds correct. It's not scientific at all and I am loathe to accept such an argument, given how flawed human edifices of pure logic are.

What we can empirically observe is that humans purchase various things, while others save money, and on occassion some pay in order to save money.

2) Any of the mining pools will do. Some don't require you to register, you just use your address as the username. Those might be considered easier but they normally take a bigger cut.

If you go to ""Addresses"" and generate a new one, or select an existing one, it will change the address displayed in the main window. The client will sometimes create a new address automatically and store it there as well.

t3_hfv4a,0,7,7,"See, lets analyze the current system (fiat money). The money you're holding constantly lose value and thus force you to spend them fast. Saving is hard. This is the reason why you can't retire early and you have to work for your entire life if you're a common folk like I am.

In fiat money based economy, the economy grows, but resources are used very rapidly and people are over-spending, over-consuming. It's not surprising that the earth is getting more and more polluted and western countries go more and more in dept.

The only way to ""go forward"" in such economy for normal man is borrowing money. This makes most of the people economical slaves. Sure, you can buy shiny things in big quantities (things that other slaves produced), but you have to work almost whole life and give big share to what you earn to rich people ruling the system.


All the rich people controlling (actually having big influence on; no big conspiracy implied) the world are interested is keeping you and me in a hamster circle. You work, work, work, economy grows, economists are happy. There are many reasons for this: because country can have bigger armies, because economists believe it's good (all that modern economists are interested in is the entire market output), because politics and bankers have greater influence on everything in such system.

Also -- please note how ofter the argument is ""deflation is bad for debtors"". But why they have to be any debtors in the first place? Can't people just work and save like it used to be? You see -- ""people ruling the word"" are more or less kind of bankers. And they want you to want to be a debtor, because this secures their income at your cost.

Have you ever wondered why, despite all this economic growth there are still so many poor people, the rich are getting richer, even people that are doing well can't just work like ... one day in a week because they have already secured their future? Why we can spend so much on shiny shit, while whole countries are starving elsewhere? Where does the deforestation, pollution, etc. come from?

It's all because of overspending. And the fiat money is the reason. Yes, the economy grows with fiat money, but is it really the only thing we're interested in?

Let's see how it looks in deflationary economy.

First thing, you always have to buy some stuff. You want to eat? You have to buy it and the fact that tomorrow it will be 1% cheaper is not a big argument when you're hungry. If you require medical attention, you're not going to wait. You want to have your car repaired, you have to pay now or walk until you decide it's worth it. You can read this book next month, when it will be 10% ""cheaper"", but do you really want to wait?

Yes, people will spend less. You're not going to buy new TV just because new one is 3'' bigger and company creating TVs will not be able to do such large profts. But the fact that you didn't bought something is a good thing because someone else can use resources you didn't consumed to do something useful. And rise in value of your savings is a reward for patience. Thanks to you not consuming, economy grows, so grows the value of your savings.

In the price deflationary economy there are no banks (like we known today). They are not needed. If you want to invest, you just save from your work, postpone consumption and buy stuff you need for your investment cheaply (because other people didn't used them to create, buy and consume shiny toys). You don't need to get credit for your startup or business. You can work more, consume less and slowly but steady accumulate capital to invest. So there debts is not as wildly use in such economy.

The businesses in such economy are not like we see today. Companies are producing stuff that people really need and are willing to buy not because they have nothing else to spend their money on, but because it's really worth it. The economy is much, much smaller, but more lightweight for the environment. It grows slower, but in more ""we-need"" than ""we-desire"" way. People are consuming less, but can spend more time on things they're willing to do, or educating, reading, creating art or just giving their life a real meaning instead of attending ""whole-life-8h-per-day-race for consumption.

The point is that you get money for running nodes that keep the bitcoin network in operation.  

The ""lottery"" aspect of it is that the system needs a way to agree upon how and when to periodically ""settle"" a set of transactions, preferably approximately every 10 minutes. This is accomplished by creating a hash threshold that should take about 10 minutes to find given the current network participation level (difficulty), and then accepting a settlement ""block"" from the first PC on the network to reach or exceed that threshold.

Currently, you get a bonus of 50 bitcoins (plus voluntary transaction fees for those who elected to get higher priority) as an incentive to help keep the network in operation, but this is only being done as a way to seed the network into existence.  Eventually, the bonus will decrease until the only significant amount you receive for successfully settling a block will be the transaction fees.

PHP was broken by design from the start. 

1. `register_globals` was a disaster, which they [admit](http://php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php) in the current documentation. You don't need to be a genius to foresee that it is a bad approach, this requires just a bit of thinking. (""How this can be exploited?"")

2. `magic quotes gpc` was a disaster too and they admit it.

3. PHP was used mostly with MySQL, but the first MySQL API did not have anything like query parameters, so it required escaping strings (see `maginc quotes gpc`) to avoid SQL injections. But it is hard to do escaping in the right places so it led to awful numbers of SQL injection vulnerabilities and shaped PHP's reputation. Note that if you use query parameters SQL injections are not possible by definition.

4. See above -- extremely bad security practices just few years ago.

So I don't know how it is possible to have a worse reputation aside from making it vulnerable intentionally.

Note that reputation is something which needs to be earned. If security practices would suddenly ideal that doesn't mean that people would start to trust PHP after all this bullshit which was happening years ago.

Note that reputation is something which needs to be earned. If security practices would suddenly ideal that doesn't mean that people would start to trust PHP after all this bullshit which was happening years ago.

To rephrase it, let's say `bitcoinex` dude who confessed the MtGox DDoS would say he is sorry and will never do it again. Let's imagine he is sincere.

Would people trust him? Fucking NO.

This article really lost me at this point due to the fact that this is flat out false. You simply have to replace ""U.S. government office"" with ""bank.""

&gt;You made money. Out of nothing.

No, you didn't. Sure, the government can print more money, but when you go to work and 'make money,' you are not producing money that didn't already exist -- the person who pays you no longer has the money that they give to you for working, and the money that *they* have is given to them by customers who purchase an item / service, and then *they* no longer have that money, etc etc.

About half of what this guy is saying actually matters or means anything. Saying 'printing money doesn't cause hyperinflation' is like saying 'guns don't kill people' without the conditional '... unless they're wielded by someone with the intent to kill.' The point is, printing money *does* cause hyperinflation, just like guns kill people *when they are pointed at someone and fired.*

And that's the entire gist of this article -- it's half-truths combined with a Devil's Advocate approach to a system that seems to only be partially comprehended. There are some good points -- such as, one breach of the bitcoin security could spell disaster for the whole thing -- but there are other points -- such as it being an online-only currency -- that really do not matter in the slightest to what bitcoin is.

t3_h8t42,0,12,12,"&gt;It is true that banks use the same cryptography algorithms for security, however they are able to change them relatively easily if some flaw is found. Can the same be said for a decentralised network like Bitcoin?

Banks could indeed change their cryptographic algorithms, but it would take some effort from their part. Similarely, Bitcoin could change the cryptographic algorithms, but it would take some effort, even a bit more complicated than the banking example because the whole community (or a big majority) would have to agree.

I spect more competing currencies to appear so different solutions to this problem could be implemented and you could choose the one you prefered.

&gt;Once a security flaw is found in the system, how would a ""fix"" be applied?

Its a decentralized network, therefore the clients that have the most mining power is the protocol that ""wins"". Therefore if a flaw is found and a new client is released with the flaw fixed, the community would have to start using the new client.

This is actually simpler than it sounds. At the begining there were bugs found and people actualized the client without too much problem for the network.

1. BTC inflation rate is currently at 50% per year.  This will decrease to 33% next year, and will eventually start to become reasonable in 2017 when BTC inflation will be around 4% per year.
2. Acceptance of BTC may outpace it's inflation rate, so BTC values may shoot up on speculation.  It could also fall rapidly on bad news.
3. Although not illegal nor immoral to own or use BTC, the powers that be may decide to take actions (regardless of what the law says or allows) to destroy BitCoin.
4. Laws may be passed to force users of cryptology to entrust keys with government agencies.  In the states, this is a clear violation of constitutional rights, but lately, the constitution does not seem to matter.  I've read about the requirement in either the U.K. or E.U. to provide upon request keys to encrypted data on your hard drive if the government requests it.  If you don't provide the keys, you could face jail time.
5. On the up side, if BTC were to replace the current U.S. money supply, each BTC would be worth around $650,000 each.  If BTC were to replace global currency, each BTC would be worth around $2.1 Million each.

My personal take on BTC is to use it like novelty money or an instrument of speculation/investment.  Eventually, the centers of power will find ways to sideline BitCoin, as they need ways to inflate money for purposes of war.

As for being optimistic about a person's ability to understand, again I would say that can lead to very undesirable results because believe it or not, your judgement about a person can be dead wrong and you're better off realizing that right away than later down the road because you were a nice guy. Again, I don't mean to sound like an asshole lol. Optimism is just another word for faith, and I make damn sure faith and my money stay the hell away from each other. Faith has no room in the financial world.

If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC. Instead, mention the vague concept of ""this new internet currency"" and give them a general description of the concept of BTC **without** mentioning the specific (and easily Googleable) word ""Bitcoin"". This is the approach I've taken with the handful of people I've recently decided to explain this concept to, and fortunately they both realized I knew exactly what I was talking about and that this ""internet currency"" is something I've secretly been investing in for a while.

Bottom line: Assume nothing about an individual until you have a fairly deep understanding of their ideologies, because that inadvertently is a huge factor when it comes to how they'll react to the concept of BTC.

t3_fpt30,0,4,4,"IMO, you've got three options.

* Join a pool
* Invest serious money into hardware
* Purchase a ""mining contract""
* Forget generating Bitcoin altogether

Joining a pool will decrease the variability of reward. Mining on your own, you'll get 50 BTC on average every ~4 years. If you join a pool, you will average out to the same 50 BTC over the same time period, but you get paid a small amount every time the pool finds a block.

If you want to purchase hardware to increase your generating capacity, cram a computer with as many Radeon 5970s as you can. Out of the box, you can probably install two per motherboard, maybe three. With some custom fiddling, you can get four working properly.

You could also purchase a contract from someone that has a large mining farm. This guarantees you a set hash rate for a set period of time, for a set amount of money. The only variables left are generation difficulty and exchange rate.

That said, I'd recommend the last option, forget about it altogether. The Bitcoin economy is growing, and that means increasing specialization. I don't think it will be too long before the only people left mining are doing so professionally. Keep in mind that the 50 BTC reward for finding a block is only temporary, and I think it's better described as a *subsidy*. Eventually, there will be no subsidy (halves every ~4 years), and the whole incentive to generate blocks will come from collecting transaction fees.

The short answer is that it is a very complicated question involving many many different laws, including ones relating to currency, banking, securities, money laundering, etc. I have not seen any compelling legal analysis about bitcoin (whether in bitcoin forums or elsewhere) so be careful about what you believe. When someone just states ""bitcoin is legal"" without a lick of legal analysis that person has no idea what he is talking about. 

Local currencies do provide some limited insights, but they are not completely equal to bitcoin in a large number of ways (bitcoin is meant to circulate broadly whereas local currencies are, by definition, local; bitcoin is digital and anonymous whereas local currencies are paper and usually not anonymous in the same way, etc...). The truth is that bitcoin is likely in a legal grey area in some ways, although I'm not sure if it's a grey area in ways that should worry most users yet. Still working on it.

I can tell you for sure that the Liberty Dollar situation has nothing to do with bitcoin. This is part of my paper that I already wrote, having researched the relevant statutes, indictment, jury verdict, etc. I also interviewed one of the prosecuting assistant us attorneys and also bernard Von nothaus himself. First, it's clear that the specific statutes don't apply because they are limited to metal coins, as @truthtechnician points out.. Second, the case wasn't about the legality of alternative currencies, but instead counterfeiting and fraud. Nothaus and his crew mislead many people into believing that Liberty Dollars were legitimate U.S.-backed currency. With regard to fraud: These individuals would unwittingly accept a, say $10 liberty dollar coin for payment of $10, but weren't told that the metal in them was worth much less. Almost every single comment on any website and all articles or op eds I've seen on this issue have really missed the point.

If the objective is globalization, BitCoin does fit well as a global currency.  It has some interesting properties that help globalization.

1. You cannot physically steel BitCoins.  In fact, attempting to do so could result in destruction of BitCoins and deflation.  You may be able to hack someone's computer and take the BitCoin wallet, but that is a lot less destructive than threatening or killing them.
2. Deflation will encourage slower growth.  This happens because people can sit on their appreciating BitCoins instead of working to avoid inflation.  Slower growth fits better with the environmental problems we are having with massive industrialization.
3. BitCoins have the potential to be ubiquitous.  As long as there is an internet connection, BitCoins can exist.  One could send money to anyone around the globe in a matter of minutes.  People in emerging nations would have a way to exchange value unencumbered banking structures and corruption. (Assuming infrastructure for internet or data cell phone service.)  Again, theft becomes difficult and the poor have a better chance of accumulating wealth.
4. People would have more faith in a decentralized uncontrolled money system.  This would spur smart growth instead of the steroid induced growth the world has seen thus far.  (Freedom is a great way to encourage innovation.)
5. Going to physical war would only destroy BitCoins and slow down economic production in both the attacking and defending countries.
6. Encouraging or allowing BitCoins to become a real currency would be seen as an indication to ""Gold Bugs"" and others in the Libertarian movement that the world powers are not interested in power for powers sake, but are rather interested in the advancement of world civilization.

Bitcoin is not flawless, but it has the advantage of an enthusiastic and rapidly growing community supporting it. As time goes on, and more and more nodes and computing power back up the network, and more and more savy programmers scrutinize the code, the flaws should be minimized to the point where it is superior to any competing currency, all of which have flaws of their own.

As far as I can tell, the key feature of bitcoin is the use of *proof of work* to prevent double spending. This in turn relies on cryptographic techniques which create asymmetry or irreversibility. These features tie bitcoins to the physical world laws of energy (proof of work) and thermodynamics (irreversibility), which together give bitcoins their scarcity. 

Usually, the realm of pure information is immune to the limitations of the physical world, and data can be copied *ad infinitum*. Too bad the physical world does not also have such unlimited abundance; then we wouldn't need money. It was quite a clever trick to port the scarcity of the physical world into the info world.

You shouldn't treat people whose intelligence level you're unaware of as intelligent-- instead, try to take the most neutral approach and over time you'll become very good at noticing the most subtle cues. Sounds ridiculous at first, but I'm sure you have an inkling of what I'm talking about. 

As for being optimistic about a person's ability to understand, again I would say that can lead to very undesirable results because believe it or not, your judgement about a person can be dead wrong and you're better off realizing that right away than later down the road because you were a nice guy. Again, I don't mean to sound like an asshole lol. Optimism is just another word for faith, and I make damn sure faith and my money stay the hell away from each other. Faith has no room in the financial world.

If someone comes across as a happy-go-lucky person who claims they've dabbled in the stock market, **do not** assume this person can grasp the potential of BTC. Instead, mention the vague concept of ""this new internet currency"" and give them a general description of the concept of BTC **without** mentioning the specific (and easily Googleable) word ""Bitcoin"". This is the approach I've taken with the handful of people I've recently decided to explain this concept to, and fortunately they both realized I knew exactly what I was talking about and that this ""internet currency"" is something I've secretly been investing in for a while.

Bottom line: Assume nothing about an individual until you have a fairly deep understanding of their ideologies, because that inadvertently is a huge factor when it comes to how they'll react to the concept of BTC.

Also, the more hashes put toward mining, the higher the difficulty. The system scales so that a block is discovered cracked every 10 minutes, no faster, no slower. 
Pools are a better bet, hundreds of people pooling their CPU and GPU clocks together to produce gigahashes per second... the one i'm using is around 140 Gigahash/s and when we crack a block it is divided amongst the participants (weighted to how many hashes per second you produce... and since i'm so low, i get a very low percent.) but ive still made maybe half a bitcoin in the past 4 days. :D ",0,False,t1_c1ujqyd,True,Bitcoin,t1_c1ujl2p,c1ujqyd,0,Nesetalis,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427155786,1305653298

* Every site owner would have to setup an account/ID for the BitCoin management. Many, many webmaster may not know about the program, those who know may not give a damn about it, and some may try to exploit it for their own gain.
* The potential risk for abuse is low if we're dealing with micro amounts, but it's still a possibility. Hell, if I had my own personal site set up with this theoretical API, even I might try writing a script to go through different IP addresses (proxies/VPNs/zombies) with different usernames to upvote different postings of my site. Really, just to see if I could accomplish such a thing. But if I would do it out of curiosity, someone else may do it with the intent of personal gain. And there's one more thing that comes to mind.
* How would this nano-sized currency be donated? By which I mean, would it come from the upvoter or would it be donated from the origin (BitCoin, which creates the coinage out of thin air). If it's the upvoter who donates, the API would have to be able to ask for or store (or perhaps even look-up from a database) the BitCoin ID of the upvoter. This isn't impossible, but it would take quite a bit of time to develop, test, and deploy. The increase in hassle would fight of the minuscule potential for abuse and it would also prevent unnecessary inflation. Speaking of which, if the nano BitCoin donation came directly BitCoin (as an award without a donor, basically) then it would slowly but surely increase the rate of inflation even more. And in the worse case scenario, if people start abusing it with scripts, more and more grows the inflation. **But..** That's only if the creators and managing coders of BitCoin would decide to get involved in such a venture. ;)

So those are the thoughts that flew threw my head after I calmed down from the initial excitement. I'm sure there's a way to establish something like this in the future, but it will take time, a ton of thought, and a lot of cooperation.

Bitcoin is not flawless, but it has the advantage of an enthusiastic and rapidly growing community supporting it. As time goes on, and more and more nodes and computing power back up the network, and more and more savy programmers scrutinize the code, the flaws should be minimized to the point where it is superior to any competing currency, all of which have flaws of their own.

As far as I can tell, the key feature of bitcoin is the use of *proof of work* to prevent double spending. This in turn relies on cryptographic techniques which create asymmetry or irreversibility. These features tie bitcoins to the physical world laws of energy (proof of work) and thermodynamics (irreversibility), which together give bitcoins their scarcity. 

Usually, the realm of pure information is immune to the limitations of the physical world, and data can be copied *ad infinitum*. Too bad the physical world does not also have such unlimited abundance; then we wouldn't need money. It was quite a clever trick to port the scarcity of the physical world into the info world.

This will only happen if the computing power keeps grows rapidly indefinitely. It's not about how much computer power there is, just about how fast it's growing.

Here are the numbers:

Every 2 weeks the difficulty resets so that a new block is made every 10 minutes. So if a new block is being made every, say, 8 minutes, then there is 25% more computing power mining coins than there was two weeks ago. This only lasts until the difficulty reset (which is every 2 weeks).

Let's assume the computing power quadruples every year (really generous assumption). This means that at the end of every two week period there is 5% more computing power than there was at the beginning of the two week period. So blocks could be minted up to 5% faster than planned.

The 18 million bitcoins point is planned for 2020, so it might happen in 2019 instead of 2020.

The current number of BitCoins is around 6 million, and at $3.80 per BTC, that makes the current market capitalization of about 23 Million.  Keep in mind that the number of BitCoins being introduced to the system is around 50% for 2011 and around 33% for 2012, and then around 10% or less for the years thereafter. 

23 million is an incredibly small amount when taking into account the number of U.S. dollars (around 14 trillion).  So, how do you think BTC will be used?  Will BTC be used for a good portion of online transactions?  How about in person sales?

Here is an example of how I look at it.  I figure BTC will account for at least 1/10th of a percent (.1%) of the transactions in the U.S. in 3 to 4 years time.  So, figuring .1% of 14 trillion gives 14 billion.  Since there will be only 21 million BTC, I divide 14 billion by 21 million to give me a ball park idea of what bitcoins will be worth in the future.  14 billion divided by 21 million gives me about $670 per bitcoin.

Also I think it would be rather hard to ban bitcoins without buying all other virtual currencies -- linden dollars, WoW money gift cards, etc, etc. Otherwise 1) bitcoin is very similar to in-game toy money, pretty much indistinguishable; 2) you can exchange bitcoins for, say, linden dollars and then exchange linden dollars to USD.

Then because dollars would be passing through so few hands from issuance to redemption people would see the effects of the inflation tax far more clearly.  Right now i43% of the government's revenue comes from inflation.  That number is likely to increase.  So if it were 50% that means that the government spends $2 for every $1 that it takes in.  As long as the USD market is large this results in an inflation rate that isn't alarming, something in the single digits.

Bitcoins are a deflationary currency. That means that people will avoid spending the bitcoins they have unless they really have to, because they will be worth more tomorrow. If bitcoins were the only currency, people would use them to buy things they really need but wouldn't necessarily invest what is left in productive but risky ventures as those who have savings in inflationary currencies tend to do.

However, bitcoins aren't the only currency so people will spend any money they have that is in the form of inflationary (or less deflationary) currencies first. That means that even though the value of bitcoins will be maintained or increase, they won't ever be traded very much.

Eventually, all bitcoins will end up in the hands of those rich enough to be able to keep them indefinitely, at which point they won't ever be used for anything and the currency will simply grind to a halt - it'll be as much of a currency as Van Gogh paintings are (and less beautiful). So all the energy that is expended mining bitcoins is ultimately wasted - creating something that is both valuable and useless as anything except a store of value.

That's not to say that mining or buying bitcoins is an irrational thing to do from a self-interest perspective - they may very well be a good investment from the perspective of expected returns.

t3_gz79a,0,2,2,"&gt; Relying on eWallets like that significantly undermines the purpose of BitCoin.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.

&gt; Your balance in each of them is essentially a separate centrally-managed currency that is interoperable with BitCoin-at-large.

Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

Well that's what the Bitcoin guys keep saying on their wiki. Don't worry guys, it'll scale. _We just haven't figured out how to do it yet_. 

And they never will, because when you build a fully connected distributed system that uses global broadcast, you're not actually building a peer-to-peer system, you're building a _replicated server_. Which means you cannot cope with more transactions by adding more nodes, instead, you only make things worse. You can distribute a single node over multiple machines inside a datacentre, but that means the thing will be run by a federation of large corporations. 

It's only popular because it's a magic box that creates money out of thin air.

http://www.bitcoin.org/sites/default/files/bitcoin.pdf

&gt;A raw version of that function that is not corrected for the expected increase in computing power. That is, a function with number of Bitcoins on the X axis and the amount of CPU cycles needed to generate the next Bitcoin on the Y axis.

That is the raw function. The FAQ says:

""The difficulty of the problem is adjusted so that in the first 4 years of the Bitcoin network, 10,500,000 coins will be created. The amount is halved each 4 years, so it will be 5,250,000 in years 4-8, 2,625,000 in years 8-12 and so on. Thus the total number of coins will approach 21,000,000 over time.""

The hardness correction is there to keep that function. So if there is a lot of processing power the same amount of bitcoins are generated. In the first 4 years its 50 bitcoins each ~12 minutes. No more no less. So a graph with CPU cycles on one end and bitcoins on the other is not possible.

&gt;Amount of Bitcoins held by the ""wealthiest"" participants.

You cannot be sure. You can only ask people. Every transaction is public however so you could calculate with a program what is the Bitcoin address with the most money at a certain time.

&gt;Number of people participating in the Bitcoin p2p network over time.

For this you can just monitor the irc channel where all the nodes announce themselves I believe.

t3_h36b0,0,1,1,"&gt; Adding an user will require M message to that user (to notify him of all previous transactions), which is exacly the ""block chain download"" you perform when you start a new client, an operation that is very long already btw)

That part really doesn't need to be as long as it is. The whole reason behind the [data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree) chosen to store the block chain is its ability to trim older transactions without impeding the ability to verify the validity of the chain.

As for the rest, the 1M user x 1 M transaction is 1T message, sure, but how many message will each user actually see? 1M. How many messages will at most be sent over a particular user's pipe? 1M * (1+bitcoin neighbors). For me right now, that'd be *9. Okay. Note that the bandwidth I consume on my side is only correlated to the number of transactions happening, not to the total number of users on the network.

So that doesn't sound quite as scary as your final verdict of unscalability, mostly because the load is fairly well distributed over the entire network.

Now to go back to your 1T figure, yes, that's about the total amount of data that the internet would need to carry as a whole. You could argue that ISPs might start to get nervous if this gets very popular. Or maybe it wouldn't even register as a blip compared to the large quantity of video-on-demand otherwise clogging the pipes.

Here's why it's profitable:

Keep in mind the hashing isn't just a way to hand out bitcoins, it's also keeping the system itself working.  

From many comments I've read, most people are already at the point where the energy costs exceed or equal the payout.  Eventually bitcoin amounts will be smaller and farther between, and those who have the winning hash will earn more from transaction fees than from the bitcoin generation.

I'm not sure why the khash varies so much, mine stays pretty consistently +/- 10% when I watch it.  Keep in mind 5000 khash/s is mostly a sort of long shot lottery, as it would take on average 1565 days to win a hash at the current difficulty (which is very likely to go up significantly in the next two days).

Just for fun I have coin generation on with my desktop (set to use one cpu), but my primary interest isn't with mining.  What I'm probably going to do is use bitcoin to ""garage sale"" a bunch of stuff in my storage unit without all the eBay/paypal red tape and risks.

t3_he4ao,0,3,3,"I am not an economist but I'm gonna respond to the #1 post...

&gt; Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an ""algorithm"" which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be ""mined"". Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?). To solve this second problem, the supply of Bitcoin is algorithmically limited, which is again good for early adopters.

The difficulty of mining increases (that is to say, the target decreases) as the total processing power of the network increases, as often as every two weeks, such that a block will be generated approximately every ten minutes.  If everyone tries to mine bitcoins all day consistently for two weeks, the network will adjust and the rate of bitcoin generation will be the same in the long run.

&gt; Known rate -- ok, I'm with you, predictable inflation, not necessarily desirable from an economic standpoint, but I'll go with it -- but decreasing rate? If you were designing a currency that was going to topple the world order, wouldn't you want it to look like this? Or at least have constant in rate of growth? Yes, of course you would, because that's the only way to actually accommodate more people using it.

Bitcoins are currently divisible into 8 decimal places.  If that is not enough, the protocol can be updated to accomodate for more divisions, and therefore, more people.

&gt; But Bitcoin is not designed to be a functioning currency, it's designed to enrich early adopters. Again, that is why it is a scam. Period.

The early adopters who have the most bitcoins do not determine its value, the people who want to trade for bitcoins do.  Also, the bitcoins the early adopters get from mining blocks is payment for supporting the network, and protecting it from malicious users.  This isn't ""free money"" in the sense of money earned without invested effort.

&gt; As a quick thought experiment, let's say demand for Bitcoin grew as more people found out about them. Well, you'd expect the price of Bitcoin in dollars to grow rapidly. Now assume I own one Bitcoin. I also have a dollar bill. I would like to purchase a Pepsi. Which one of those will I spend? Obviously the devaluing dollar gets spent before the skyrocketing Bitcoin.

Isn't the occurrance of a bubble a natural event when something new and exchangeable enters the market?  A bubble does not mean a scam or a destined failure.  However, this might be the first time this happens to a currency, which brings us to the next point.

&gt; The critical point here is that exchange rates might change, but they never go away completely. The term in economics is ""convertibility"". For Bitcoin to work as a currency, it would have to act as a predictable store of value, which means it needs to be easily convertible to all other stores of value depending on an individual's needs or wants. It needs to be a part of that tee-pee. It isn't.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem here is that because Bitcoin is completely decentralized, no one is completely invested in the long-term success of the system. No one is literally making the market, saying ""no matter what happens, I'll buy Bitcoins from you at some price"". I understand that there are ""exchanges"" floating around. Their commitment to this market is (in my opinion) not credible. Anyone and everyone can just pick up their ball and leave.

I'm not sure how to respond to this.  That's a good point.

&gt; More importantly, is there anyone that even CAN do that? When a bank collapses, the federal reserve can honor deposits by quite literally printing money and giving people their cash back if need be. That slight increase in expected inflation (maybe) is a small price to pay for avoiding a financial meltdown. In the bitcoin economy, that's literally  impossible. It's decentralized; it's a published algorithm. No one can change it, and even if they could, it's no one's job to do so. Anyone with a large stake in Bitcoin will be too busy trying to get their own money out to worry about systemic risk. 

The algorithm and protocol can be changed as needed.  Those who do the mining have a stake in the system and would be enticed to fix the issue.  Remember, once bitcoins stop being given out by blocks, miners will be funded by transaction fees.  Therefore, it is in their best interest to fix the algorithm and protocol as necessary. The system is flexible, but we will have to see how well it fares against any challenges before we can determine if it is sufficiently resilient or not.",0,False,t1_c1upfr9,True,Bitcoin,t3_he4ao,c1upfr9,0,Ruzihm,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427158531,1305725736

So mining may not be the free-money extravaganza you think it is.

At the same time, these ""rich"" became rich by contributing to a project that had little chance of succeeding even to the extent that it already has, and is far from finished with the ""not dying"" phase of its growth. From this perspective they're best looked at as VCs of a sort. They've taken an unlikely chance of making a huge profit, and so far it seems they've gotten lucky.

Second, I've only got two computers, and it's very much a master/slave set up, so it's not that complicated for me. 

As far as syncing wallets within the protocol, I'm unsure of how you'd do that. Wallets can *sort of* share bitcoins right now, due to the way wallets actually work. Wallets are a list of private keys, and each private key corresponds to a bitcoin receiving address. If the block chain has a record that says, for instance, ""ADDRESS 12345 RECEIVES 5 BITCOINS"", and I have a wallet file that has the private key that corresponds to address 12345, then I have the bitcoins. I can make as many copies of that wallet as I want, and they all have those bitcoins. If I then exhaust the new address pool in two copies of the wallet, I'll then have two wallets that are different, but both share those old coins.

The only way that a wallet would be able to share coins is to share private keys. But, basically, there's no good way to exchange private keys, short of physically, manually doing it. So I think that there might not be a good way to do that in the protocol. What I would like (and this might already exist) is a convenient mechanism to deal with wallets. Routine backup. Wallet encryption. Backing up and restoring wallets without quitting the bitcoin client. Merging two wallets.

t3_he4ao,0,3,3,"I am not an economist but I'm gonna respond to the #1 post...

&gt; Bitcoin does not have a central bank capable of printing and lending Bitcoin; it has an ""algorithm"" which through some convoluted mechanism allows Bitcoins to be ""mined"". Essentially it randomly allocates Bitcoin to early adopters. This is a very good system for early adopters (free money!) It is a nonsensical system for a real currency, not to mention being obviously unscalable (what happens when everyone tries to mine Bitcoin all day long?). To solve this second problem, the supply of Bitcoin is algorithmically limited, which is again good for early adopters.

The difficulty of mining increases (that is to say, the target decreases) as the total processing power of the network increases, as often as every two weeks, such that a block will be generated approximately every ten minutes.  If everyone tries to mine bitcoins all day consistently for two weeks, the network will adjust and the rate of bitcoin generation will be the same in the long run.

&gt; Known rate -- ok, I'm with you, predictable inflation, not necessarily desirable from an economic standpoint, but I'll go with it -- but decreasing rate? If you were designing a currency that was going to topple the world order, wouldn't you want it to look like this? Or at least have constant in rate of growth? Yes, of course you would, because that's the only way to actually accommodate more people using it.

Bitcoins are currently divisible into 8 decimal places.  If that is not enough, the protocol can be updated to accomodate for more divisions, and therefore, more people.

&gt; But Bitcoin is not designed to be a functioning currency, it's designed to enrich early adopters. Again, that is why it is a scam. Period.

The early adopters who have the most bitcoins do not determine its value, the people who want to trade for bitcoins do.  Also, the bitcoins the early adopters get from mining blocks is payment for supporting the network, and protecting it from malicious users.  This isn't ""free money"" in the sense of money earned without invested effort.

&gt; As a quick thought experiment, let's say demand for Bitcoin grew as more people found out about them. Well, you'd expect the price of Bitcoin in dollars to grow rapidly. Now assume I own one Bitcoin. I also have a dollar bill. I would like to purchase a Pepsi. Which one of those will I spend? Obviously the devaluing dollar gets spent before the skyrocketing Bitcoin.

Isn't the occurrance of a bubble a natural event when something new and exchangeable enters the market?  A bubble does not mean a scam or a destined failure.  However, this might be the first time this happens to a currency, which brings us to the next point.

&gt; The critical point here is that exchange rates might change, but they never go away completely. The term in economics is ""convertibility"". For Bitcoin to work as a currency, it would have to act as a predictable store of value, which means it needs to be easily convertible to all other stores of value depending on an individual's needs or wants. It needs to be a part of that tee-pee. It isn't.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem here is that because Bitcoin is completely decentralized, no one is completely invested in the long-term success of the system. No one is literally making the market, saying ""no matter what happens, I'll buy Bitcoins from you at some price"". I understand that there are ""exchanges"" floating around. Their commitment to this market is (in my opinion) not credible. Anyone and everyone can just pick up their ball and leave.

I'm not sure how to respond to this.  That's a good point.

&gt; More importantly, is there anyone that even CAN do that? When a bank collapses, the federal reserve can honor deposits by quite literally printing money and giving people their cash back if need be. That slight increase in expected inflation (maybe) is a small price to pay for avoiding a financial meltdown. In the bitcoin economy, that's literally  impossible. It's decentralized; it's a published algorithm. No one can change it, and even if they could, it's no one's job to do so. Anyone with a large stake in Bitcoin will be too busy trying to get their own money out to worry about systemic risk. 

The algorithm and protocol can be changed as needed.  Those who do the mining have a stake in the system and would be enticed to fix the issue.  Remember, once bitcoins stop being given out by blocks, miners will be funded by transaction fees.  Therefore, it is in their best interest to fix the algorithm and protocol as necessary. The system is flexible, but we will have to see how well it fares against any challenges before we can determine if it is sufficiently resilient or not.",0,False,t1_c1upfr9,True,Bitcoin,t3_he4ao,c1upfr9,0,Ruzihm,False,,,t5_2s3qj,,1427158531,1305725736
