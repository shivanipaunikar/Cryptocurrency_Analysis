&gt; When I saw the name of Basho as a Japanese, I was very happy.
I was looking forward to the roadmap announcement this time. I will expect it next time.
This announcement seemed to be great information for pre-sale and ADA owners who have been watching the development of CARDANO for a long time since launch. However, those who were recently aware of CARDANO and ADA felt that it is very difficult to be honest, what is written when seeing the contents, and what it means. I understand that the technical content is great, but what we do with it If we do not announce what we will be able to do as a platform, we can not predict what will be possible as a platform, I thought that I do not feel much attractive. As a matter of fact, a child was born this year and I'm attaching something called the Maternal and Child Handbook of Japan. Although it is different from the roadmap, it is something like an indicator, a record that shows the child growing properly, but it is very easy to understand. I would be pleased if the roadmap would be like a child like CARDANO and I could watch over the growth.

,hydrozappa,,,,"Cardano is a project that began in 2015 as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed.
“The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration.”
Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed.
“Our large team of expert engineers and researchers drawn from around the world started by deconstructing the concept of a cryptocurrency. Then, incorporating our groundbreaking Proof of Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, the IOHK team employed a first principles approach driven by peer reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.”
Cardano is the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet, a product that brings together such disciplines as distributed systems, mechanism design and cryptography.
Cardano’s multi layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run next-generation smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.
As a whole, the protocol’s design is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators.
“We have designed a system that can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and are installing a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.”
In the spirit of many open source projects, Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. Rather, it embraced a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. These include the following:
Separation of accounting and computation into different layers
Implementation of core components in highly modular functional code
Small groups of academics and developers competing with peer reviewed research
Heavy use of interdisciplinary teams including early use of InfoSec experts
Fast iteration between white papers, implementation and new research required to correct issues discovered during review
Building in the ability to upgrade post-deployed systems without destroying the network
Development of a decentralized funding mechanism for future work
A long-term view on improving the design of cryptocurrencies so they can work on mobile devices with a reasonable and secure user experience
Bringing stakeholders closer to the operations and maintenance of their cryptocurrency
Acknowledging the need to account for multiple assets in the same ledger
Abstracting transactions to include optional metadata in order to better conform to the needs of legacy systems
Learning from the nearly 1,000 altcoins by embracing features that make sense
Adopt a standards-driven process inspired by the Internet Engineering Task Force using a dedicated foundation to lock down the final protocol design
Explore the social elements of commerce
Find a healthy middle ground for regulators to interact with commerce without compromising some core principles inherited from Bitcoin
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.
Cardano is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.
The Cardano development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.
Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion.
Cardano is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language.
The aggregation of our principled exploration of the cryptocurrency space is two collections of protocols:
A provably secure proof of stake based cryptocurrency called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.
You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws.
Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason: It is the first component of the Cardano Platform.
CSL’s consensus algorithm is controlled by a diverse and increasingly more decentralized set of actors or their delegated assigns.
While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.
The value ledger is called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). As the purpose is to account for value, the roadmap has the following goals:
Support two sets of scripting languages, one to move value and another to enhance overlay protocol support
Provide support for KMZ sidechains to link to other ledgers
Support multiple types of signature including quantum resistant signatures for higher security
Support multiple user issued assets
Achieve true scalability, meaning as more users join, the capabilities of the system increase
A set of protocols called the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL).
With CCL, it is possible to create a special purpose token held by delegates of that ledger who could be regulated entities, thereby creating a permissioned ledger.
The flexibility of this approach allows for different instances of CCL to materialize with different rules about the evaluation of transactions. For example, gambling activities could be restricted unless KYC/AML data is present simply by blacklisting non-attributed transactions.
“Our design emphasis is to accommodate the social aspects of cryptocurrencies, build in layers by separating the accounting of value from complex computation, and address the needs of regulators within the scope of several immutable principles.”
Cardano modularity allows for features such as delegation, sidechains, sub-scribable checkpoints, better data structures for light clients, different forms of random number generation and even different synchronization assumptions. As a network develops from having thousands to millions and even billions of users, the requirements of its consensus algorithm will also change. Thus, it is vital to have enough flexibility to accommodate these changes and thereby future-proof the heart of a cryptocurrency.
“We argue that users of a protocol need incentives to understand the social contract behind their protocol and have the freedom to propose changes in a productive way. This freedom extends to every aspect of a value exchange system, from deciding how markets should be regulated to which projects should be funded. Yet it cannot be brokered through centralized actors nor require some special credential that could be co-opted by a well funded minority.”
“Our hope is that Cardano will eventually include a formal, blockchain based system to propose and vote on both soft and hard forks. Bitcoin with its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO fork, and many other cryptocurrencies besides have endured long standing and, in frequent cases, unresolved arguments over the technical and moral direction of the codebase.”
Cardano is a financial system that accepts its social nature.
Cardano’s design borrows from TCP/IP the concept of separation of concerns. In other words, separation of value from computation. This separation does not mean that Cardano will not support smart contracts. On the contrary, by making the separation explicit, it permits significantly more flexibility in the design, use, privacy and execution of smart contracts.
With respect to sidechains, Cardano will support a new protocol developed by Kiayias, Miller and Zindros (KMZ sidechains) based upon prior results from proofs of proofs of work.
The concept allows for the secure and non-interactive movement of funds from CSL to any Cardano Computation Layer or other blockchain supporting the protocol.
KMZ sidechains are the key to encapsulating complexity.
“For Cardano, we decided to start with using elliptic curve cryptography, the Ed25519 curve in particular. We also decided to enhance the existing libraries by adding support for HD wallets using Dr Dmitry Khovratovich and Jason Law’s Specification.”
“We are interested in integrating BLISS-B to add quantum computer resistant signatures to our system. We are also interested in adding SECP256k1 to enhance interoperability with legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.”
“Cardano has been designed with special extensions that will allow us to add more signature schemes through a soft fork.”
Cardano has adopted a pragmatic approach to multi-asset accounting. Building in stages, the first challenge is designing the necessary infrastructure to support the demands of thousands of UIAs. Namely the following advancements are necessary:
Special purpose authenticated data structures to permit the tracking of a very large UTXO state.
The ability to have a distributed mempool to hold a huge set of pending transactions.
Blockchain partitioning and checkpoints to permit a huge global blockchain.
An incentive scheme that rewards consensus nodes for including different sets of transactions.
A subscription mechanic that allows users to decide which currencies they want to track.

That Cardano was developed as a gaming platform initially?

Exhibit C: A Cardano Labo Github pull request from ""ethereumcharles"" showing that on February X, 201X, Cardano was forked from Cardano Labo.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"Even though your account seems to be doing nothing here except trolling, I'm going to respond anyway in case someone happens by your post and goes, 'Hey why IS that'. Full disclosure: I have no affiliation with Cardano, I don't currently own any ADA, and Cardano didn't catch my eye because of Charles Hoskinson at all, but because of Philip Wadler and Elias Koutsoupias who are world-leading researchers within their respective fields of programming language theory and game theory. I'm a programmer with an MSc in software engineering, so while I don't specifically work within blockchain technology right now, I generally know what to look for in software projects, whitepapers and so forth.

&gt; No, it doesn't need to be distributed before it's ready and no, Charles doesn't need a million testers. He has paid employees at IOHK who could setup a network of real and virtual servers to test the network in house.

It has nothing at all to do with 'needing a million testers'. Of course they test things in-house. That aside, releasing something gradually into production is a tried-and-tested method that you will see any competent large-scale software project do (for example Facebook, Google, AWS, and various others if you need examples). Also, 'Charles' doesn't -- Cardano Foundation and IOHK do. This attempted character assassination is tiresome to read through.

&gt; The bootstrap era could have been accomplished via the staff at IOHK, you don't need billions of tokens and millions of dollars in investment to send a few tokens back and forth, because let's be honest, thats all the network can do at this point.

The bootstrap era _is_ being accomplished via IOHK, thats exactly what the bootstrap era is -- the nodes are being run by IOHK. Once Cardano switches to the reward era, nodes will start being run outside of IOHK. In order for a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to function correctly, the tokens underpinning the economic incentives of staking must be fairly and widely distributed amongst preferably a large number of holders. This was the case with NXT, with BlackCoin, it is the case with NEO, and it will be the case for any other proof-of-stake algorithm relying on a fair and wide distribution of tokens.

&gt; Maybe if there was a basic smart contract platform to test, or maybe if there was even a proof of stake system that worked, then you could justify getting the public involved. But none of those things exist. None! None! None!

By this argument, no blockchain project without fee rewards for staking and active smart contracts is worth being public. By that notion, there are only a very, very, very small number of blockchain projects that 'justify' getting the public involved; and that list does _not_ include bitcoin, ethereum, or any of the current blockchains at all. Ethereum has smart contracts but not PoS, NEO has smart contracts but only bootstrap-era PoS, and so on, and so on. In short, what you're saying makes zero sense and has no bearing on reality.

&gt; Honestly if this project were at this point and being lead by anybody other than Charles, co-founder of Ethereum, this would be a total scam. You would be labeled a scam coin and you know it.

Reasons I care about Cardano:

- It has an active, involved research community counting some of the brightest people on the planet, including the two gentlemen I mentioned at the top.
- They have an _extremely_ active Github, telling me there is a ton of programming activity in the project. Far, far, far more than I've seen in most other crypto projects, by miles.
- They have individuals from Well Typed involved in the project, which are top Haskell consultants with a proven track record.
- They have been exceedingly clear in their communication, their widespread efforts to detail what they are doing and importantly _how_. The how is important, because this space is filled with a ton of bullshit and empty promises, and the how is partway to proving that Cardano is not in that category.

In my opinion, Cardano is one of few projects that have a chance at surviving for a longer time in this space and making real, serious contributions; that may not satisfy moonboys and daytraders, or those creating random accounts to shill or FUD -- but at the end of the day 90% of the companies that spring up around ICOs right now will be dead by the end of 2018, because they have no idea how they're going to do what they sold their ICO on. I'm betting on Cardano not being one of the dead ones, not least because of the points above.",True,,,,0,1509763719,,False,0,dpbjr63,False,t3_7ac7kj,t1_dpabjgr,1512109179,23,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7ac7kj/official_cardano_roadmap_discussion_thread/dpbjr63/,,public

Support for decentralized market making to improve liquidity between UIA and the primary token.
“Our preliminary efforts for finding the right authenticated data structure have resulted in a new type of AVL+ Tree jointly developed by Leo Reyzin, IOHK and Waves. More research is required, but it is a foundational advancement that will be included in a later version of Cardano.”
“We expect — subject to research results — to include a protocol into Cardano for UIAs during the Basho of CSL release in 2018.”
“Our scalability goals for Cardano are greatly aided by our consensus algorithm.”
OUROBOROS
IOHK scientists led byProf. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros.
“Our proof of stake protocol is called Ouroboros and it has been designed by an extremely talented team of cryptographers from five academic institutions led by Professor Aggelos Kiayias of the University of Edinburgh. The core innovation it brings beyond being proven secure using a rigorous cryptographic model is a modular and flexible design that allows for the composition of many protocols to enhance functionality.”
Ouroboros permits a decentralized way to elect a quorum of consensus nodes, which in turn can run more traditional protocols developed over the last 20 years to accommodate the needs of large infrastructure providers such as Google and Facebook.
Ouroboros determines how individual nodes reach consensus about the network.
Ouroboros eliminates the need for an energy-hungry proof of work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for much wider use.
Ouroboros is the first proof of stake protocol that scientifically has been shown to be provably secure.
In terms of consensus, Ouroboros was designed in a sufficiently modular fashion to support smart contract evaluation.
“In our current roadmap, scaling methods will be applied to Ouroboros starting in 2018 and continue to be a focus in 2019 and 2020.”
Both CSL and CCL will share the same consensus algorithm. The difference is that Ouroboros can be confirmed to permit both permissioned and permissionless ledgers via token distribution.
The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has.
Cardano’s HSM strategy will be to attempt implemented specialized protocols over the next two years using Intel SGX and ARM Trustzone.
Both modules are built into billions of consumer devices from laptops to cellphones and require no additional effort on the consumer side to use.
Both are also heavily vetted, well designed and based upon years of iteration from some of the largest and best funded hardware security teams.
The use of HSMs to provide an identity space where PII is not leaked but yet used to authenticate and credential actors should provide a global reputation system and allow for much lower cost regulated activities to be conducted, such as online gaming with automated tax compliance or decentralized exchanges.
The Cardano ecosystem is developing out into the most complete and most useful cryptocurrency ever constructed.
DAEDALUS
To use Ada you must download the Daedalus digital wallet. Daedalus is a secure, HD wallet for the Ada cryptocurrency.
Daedalus wallet has many special features, which make it easy to use and give you a high degree of confidence about its security. These include:
Encrypted private keys and spending passwords, offering protection against security threats such as malware.
Wallets can be exported to paper certificates, giving the maximum security option of placing funds in cold storage.
Ada redemption is built directly into Daedalus and supports encrypted and unencrypted redemption certificates.
Configurable transaction assurance level monitoring, allowing users to be sure when transactions become irreversible.
Future releases of Daedalus will allow third party developers to build innovative applications directly for the wallet. Whether you would like micro credit, to set up recurring payments, or to exchange cryptocurrencies, it will be easy to customize your Daedalus experience.
Daedalus is built on top of Electron, a battle-proven open source development platform to build cross-platform desktop apps using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
You don’t have to be a specialist in cryptography and security to build amazing plugins for Daedalus. “We provide you with rich and secure APIs to interact with cryptocurrency backends.”
The core features of Daedalus are just the beginning. “Our goal is to give anyone the power to extend Daedalus with custom plugins, automation and literally any innovation you can come up with.”
“To keep the experience consistent for Daedalus users and simplify your development workflow, we have developed a small but flexible React UI framework that you can use to build beautiful plugins that just merge into the whole platform.”
You will be able to easily adjust the current color theme for all components in the Daedalus Design Language. The best thing about this: “Developers just have to follow our guidelines to use the component framework to make this work.”
“Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on or substantive review of any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.”
“Stake” gives a user the power to control various Cardano SL algorithm parts, for example: being the slot leader, voting in the Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC. This is why all thresholds in Cardano SL protocol are expressed in terms of stake, not balance.
“When we are talking about the ‘stake’, we are talking about a user’s ability to control Cardano SL.”
IOHK will maintain a single official client, but there is also room for third-party alternative clients maintained by the community.
The Bootstrap era is the period of Cardano SL existence that allows only fixed predefined users to have control over the system.
The next era after Bootstrap is called the Reward era. Reward era is actually a “normal” operation mode of Cardano SL as a PoS-cryptocurrency.
After the Bootstrap era, the Reward era will start. During this time, the network will operate in a completely decentralized, trustless mode. “We expect staking pools to emerge during this era, allowing stakeholders with little stake to get rewards as stakeholders with large stake keep their nodes online to maintain the protocol in a decentralized fashion.”
The system will receive regular software updates moving forward, and a massive amount of new features will be released in the near future.
Though Cardano SL is designed and implemented as a distributed network, for purpose of DDoS protection additional facilities were added to Cardano SL implementation and topology.
Currently all nodes are divided into 3 groups:
Core Nodes:
“We bring additional security level around this set of core nodes: we put them inside a perimeter of relay nodes, so core nodes are isolated from the public internet and only relay nodes are allowed to communicate with core nodes. This is how we reduce probability for them being attacked.”
Core nodes never create currency transactions.
Relay Nodes:
You can think of relay nodes as of proxy between core nodes and public internet.
Since relay nodes are not isolated, they can be attacked, but they are in principle stateless and do not have any stake, so they can be moved, or their number can be increased.
If relays are taken down, this does deny service, but the integrity of the core nodes (and the blockchain) should not be compromised.
Since relay nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders.
Cannot create currency transactions.
Relay nodes are fully under the control of the federated committee of initial stakeholders.
Edge Nodes:
Edge node is a simple node that anyone can run on their computer.
Only these nodes can create currency transactions.
Since edge nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders as well as relay nodes.
Edge nodes cannot directly communicate with core nodes, only with relay nodes and with other edge nodes.

Because sorting out the lies from the truth is a freaking full time job, and if I did that I wouldn’t have any real money to buy cryptocoin promises with. 

I have a old letter from the CEO of a company I invested in assuring me that he understood my concerns and that his company was sound. This was after a silly amount of research on my part. He lied. I keep it as a reminder not to drink the kool-aid.

Cardano may be completely legit. Their website and whitepaper is impressive. But if I’m going to give them money (that I work hard for) they’ll need to clear up the questions raised (as someone did about the association with the gaming company).

,parakmiakos_trader,,,,"Very nice example of how growth works. Just to add to what I was saying before in regards to growth. Potential adopters of Cardano and people in general that do not understand how growth as you explained it works, see the price of the coin being about 3 cents now and they calculate quickly the market cap required for the coin to reach ethereum's price of $300 and work out that the market cap would have to be huge to reach to that price per ADA. What they don't take into consideration is the percentage growth of the coin it self and factor that percentage into their investment to work out their potential profits ie

I will spend $1000 to buy some ADA now ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 33,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs 30 cents = (33,333 coins X $0.3 per coin = $9,999) 
I made a profit of $9,999 - $1000 initial investment = $8,999



Now let's go to Ethereum

I will spend $1000 to buy some ETH now ($1000 at $300 per coin = roughly 3.33 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $3000 = (3.33 coins X $3000 per coin = $9,990)
I made a profit of $9,990 - $1000 initial investment = $ 8,990

Notice how 1 ADA had to go from 0.03 cents to 0.3 cents and 1 ETH had to go from $300 to $3000 TO MAKE THE SAME profit roughly. The growth of both coins was 10 times up.





Now let's start with both coins from let's say $0.03 with an initial investment of $1000

I will spend $1000 to buy ADA ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ADA coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $9.3337451e+12. This is not going to happen anytime soon. So IMHO, people should not expect to see 1 ADA costing $300. Which is what Ethereum costs today. The Ethereum boat has sailed. Unless if you want to speculate on the hundreds of ALTcoins out there: https://coinmarketcap.com/ .Who knows, you might get lucky.





I will spend $1000 to buy ETH ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I just made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ETH coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $28620880200. Which is roughly Ethereum's market cap today.



Ethereum tokens can cost $300 each because the total supply of ETH at the moment is 95,402,934 ETH (millions)
ADA tokens total supply is 31,112,483,745 ADA (billions). Which means a looot of people need to be invested in Cardano, for the price to go higher and higher...which means Cardano will have to go mainstream(they are just starting out). Well guess what, cryptos have been around long enough, the world is aware of them, so it might be time to go mainstream. This would require serious people with serious connections backing a blockchain project, as it is a big responsibility. Well these guys at Cardano seem to fulfill the criteria. (you need to reasearch them too, to form your own opinion).

Making profits from buying crypto coins is good, but we should be thinking about how our world will be affected by new technologies yes?


If you are a newbie trying to ride the hype, have a look at all those projects out there on  https://coinmarketcap.com. Make sure you research extensively the ones you might be interested in, and you will realize a whole heap of them are just a joke(there are solid ones too though), trying to make money. That's your money.


If you ask me what the future of the price of ADA will be in let's say the next two years, I am not sure!! I keep googling it but nothing comes up:P


Maybe the Cardano people can help us out here, and I don't believe they will, because they will be speculating which is something they can't do.

,Sunrise2020,,,,"Hi, this is ID Sunrise2020.  First of all,  I’d like to thank you for this chance to talk about Cardano roadmap...

1.  After count down, maybe I feel that many people thought that they could find a new information or concrete contents especially about the project or future plan, for example,’ATM will be available in December’ or ‘ A University of Illinois startup founded by computer science professor Grigore Rosu, and IOHK, a leading blockchain research and development company, are partnering to design a next-generation virtual machine called IELE and a universal language framework to be used as core infrastructure for future blockchain technologies,funding from NASA, Boeing and Toyota and so on...’.   Maybe the information on roadmap may be different from what we want to get and know,,,because it 
presents mainly technical information more than the one about easy-to-understand information for common people who do not understand about cryptcurrency or blockchain...


2. When we read a newspaper, we can easily understand the main idea if we read a headlines..
Maybe there are so many information in roadmap, so many people cannot easily understand main idea...if possible, 
clear and concise text and  contents of an article is better for us...

3.  high-impact marketing technique

If more news about IELE in details is used in the roadmap, more people may think Cardano is GREAT!
Almost all common people are mainly interested in the news that makes a good impact on market..
The future project or present project,,,we need not so many information at a time..
If Headlines and short explanation on the roadmap, it is better for us because we can understand easily.

For investor and developer or researcher...people want or need different kinds of  information depending on where one stands.  We are all investors...

4. ADA price trend
We, investors, almost all are interested in price trend...if investors get good news about the project, more people trust and understand Cardano,,and if they get bad news, they worry...and finally such a news also make an influence on price trend sometimes....we keep ADA and will keep them for a long time from now on also...because Cardano project is great!  So we invest to support Cardano and ADA...if we can increase the value of Cardano and ADA, every members in Cardano are happy, I think. And the values....it’s ithe values of Cardano project and the value of ADA as assets for us, investors...

5.  marketing effectiveness is also needed for the future

Marketing development and making marketing more effective is needed  in order to make more people understand Cardano project...even if the team can have enough ability to creat wonderful project, they can hardly attract plants and firms to Cardano, or cannot attract investment in the project from company if marketing is not effective for the world..

That’s all I want to say about the roadmap...Hope next roadmap will be better for every members...

For example, My idea is next if I add the news in roadmap as a headlines...↓

Parts of your comment may be useful to  wukifnee. 
Since you have attached your comment under mine, let me say by means of  clarification and by way of response:

1. The main point of my comment was: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""
2. I find your choice of some words/ phrases puzzling:

   a) You wrote: ""these accusations are false"". I have read each comment closely and can find no accusations being made in any of them. Just some confusion, and doubts being expressed.

   b) You wrote: ""[...] in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" I gave up trying to decipher what you meant by these words. The phrase/ pseudo sentence ""To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" is most unclear. Who was this phrase aimed at and to what purpose? By all means clarify if you wish to do so, but do so at your own peril - the phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind.

   c) You wrote: ""Do you understand the idea? For now, if you were one of my investigators, I'd request that you rewrite your report and resubmit for review."" This remark is clearly addressed to me and I take exception to it. How patronizing and what a mess! What report? 

      Tread carefully when making remarks like c) above. You are doing no service to IOHL by writing ""this type of thing"" and you don't know who I am. The phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind again.


Danesjold, I hope you're not zoning out or getting your back up. I have no reason to assume that your intentions are other than good, so I write the following in order to be helpful:

1. I have no concrete reason at the moment to believe that there is anything less than above board as regards either Charles, IOHK or IOHK's Cardano project.
2. I wrote: ""I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular, but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation"". This was poor wording on my part. 

   a) I did not state what my concerns are. This was remiss of me. However my concerns are indeed marginal (a word chosen carefully). 
 
   b) The wording leads itself open to the interpretation that I may have begun an investigation of some sort. I have not and have no intention of doing so.
 
   c) I would say in passing that, if there were a number of disgruntled investors in a previous ""Cardano"" project, it would be up to them to organize themselves and conduct their own investigation. I am sure they would do so in a proper fashion and certainly not approach this reddit for advice/ clarification/ information. I think that this point should be made, however, lest I give the wrong impression I should state that I have no reason to suspect that their investigations would lead them in any meaningful way to IOHK and IOHK's ""Cardano"" project.

I conclude by reiterating the main point of my previous post: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""

Life is short. I would prefer not to be involved further (unless, of course, you give me a bone to chew).

I hope the above is helpful :) ",True,,,,0,1509659565,,1509661264,0,dp9dxm8,False,t3_7a1101,t1_dp8gojd,1512063752,3,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7a1101/cardano_was_originally_annouced_as_gaming/dp9dxm8/,,public

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

I saw mentions about Cardano Labo in Slack, so I will explain here about Cardano Labs (or Labo).

Cardano Labo was originally a project started by Japanese businessmen who knew of the project early on and were big fans of the Cardano vision. They wanted to build a blockchain solution on Cardano when the computation layer was completed, however due to delays in development, Cardano Labo decided to proceed with other protocols and change its corporate name to Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore the possibilities of developing applications with multiple platforms, then eventually became a major player in the Vietnamese blockchain community.
There is no commercial or capital affiliation between Cardano Labo and any of the Cardano project entities to this date.
With the Cardano Computation Layer drawing near, Emurgo has been in contact with Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore possibilities of collaboration to develop DApps and smart contracts on Cardano. We are excited about the possibility to work with Infinity Blockchain Labs as they have established a strong presence and reputation in the Vietnamese blockchain and fintech industries.

Two questions, one on IELE and one on K:

Do you see this landscape consolidating somewhat in the future into some more robust, common virtual machines? And is IELE meant to be specific to Cardano, or do you see it as a thing of its own that can then potentially be used by others outside of Cardano?

- The article says that Runtime Verification is looking to build an improved backend to K that is an order of magnitude faster. Are there any benchmarks for the existing execution speed of K-compiled binaries compared to non-K-compiled binaries?

,hydrozappa,,,,"Strong security guarantees that UIAs enjoy similar security as the native asset.
Support for decentralized market making to improve liquidity between UIA and the primary token.
“Our preliminary efforts for finding the right authenticated data structure have resulted in a new type of AVL+ Tree jointly developed by Leo Reyzin, IOHK and Waves. More research is required, but it is a foundational advancement that will be included in a later version of Cardano.”
“We expect — subject to research results — to include a protocol into Cardano for UIAs during the Basho of CSL release in 2018.”
“Our scalability goals for Cardano are greatly aided by our consensus algorithm.”
OUROBOROS
IOHK scientists led byProf. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros.
“Our proof of stake protocol is called Ouroboros and it has been designed by an extremely talented team of cryptographers from five academic institutions led by Professor Aggelos Kiayias of the University of Edinburgh. The core innovation it brings beyond being proven secure using a rigorous cryptographic model is a modular and flexible design that allows for the composition of many protocols to enhance functionality.”
Ouroboros permits a decentralized way to elect a quorum of consensus nodes, which in turn can run more traditional protocols developed over the last 20 years to accommodate the needs of large infrastructure providers such as Google and Facebook.
Ouroboros determines how individual nodes reach consensus about the network.
Ouroboros eliminates the need for an energy-hungry proof of work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for much wider use.
Ouroboros is the first proof of stake protocol that scientifically has been shown to be provably secure.
In terms of consensus, Ouroboros was designed in a sufficiently modular fashion to support smart contract evaluation.
“In our current roadmap, scaling methods will be applied to Ouroboros starting in 2018 and continue to be a focus in 2019 and 2020.”
Both CSL and CCL will share the same consensus algorithm. The difference is that Ouroboros can be confirmed to permit both permissioned and permissionless ledgers via token distribution.
The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has.
Cardano’s HSM strategy will be to attempt implemented specialized protocols over the next two years using Intel SGX and ARM Trustzone.
Both modules are built into billions of consumer devices from laptops to cellphones and require no additional effort on the consumer side to use.
Both are also heavily vetted, well designed and based upon years of iteration from some of the largest and best funded hardware security teams.
The use of HSMs to provide an identity space where PII is not leaked but yet used to authenticate and credential actors should provide a global reputation system and allow for much lower cost regulated activities to be conducted, such as online gaming with automated tax compliance or decentralized exchanges.
The Cardano ecosystem is developing out into the most complete and most useful cryptocurrency ever constructed.
DAEDALUS
To use Ada you must download the Daedalus digital wallet. Daedalus is a secure, HD wallet for the Ada cryptocurrency.
Daedalus wallet has many special features, which make it easy to use and give you a high degree of confidence about its security. These include:
Encrypted private keys and spending passwords, offering protection against security threats such as malware.
Wallets can be exported to paper certificates, giving the maximum security option of placing funds in cold storage.
Ada redemption is built directly into Daedalus and supports encrypted and unencrypted redemption certificates.
Configurable transaction assurance level monitoring, allowing users to be sure when transactions become irreversible.
Future releases of Daedalus will allow third party developers to build innovative applications directly for the wallet. Whether you would like micro credit, to set up recurring payments, or to exchange cryptocurrencies, it will be easy to customize your Daedalus experience.
Daedalus is built on top of Electron, a battle-proven open source development platform to build cross-platform desktop apps using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
You don’t have to be a specialist in cryptography and security to build amazing plugins for Daedalus. “We provide you with rich and secure APIs to interact with cryptocurrency backends.”
The core features of Daedalus are just the beginning. “Our goal is to give anyone the power to extend Daedalus with custom plugins, automation and literally any innovation you can come up with.”
“To keep the experience consistent for Daedalus users and simplify your development workflow, we have developed a small but flexible React UI framework that you can use to build beautiful plugins that just merge into the whole platform.”
You will be able to easily adjust the current color theme for all components in the Daedalus Design Language. The best thing about this: “Developers just have to follow our guidelines to use the component framework to make this work.”
“Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on or substantive review of any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.”
“Stake” gives a user the power to control various Cardano SL algorithm parts, for example: being the slot leader, voting in the Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC. This is why all thresholds in Cardano SL protocol are expressed in terms of stake, not balance.
“When we are talking about the ‘stake’, we are talking about a user’s ability to control Cardano SL.”
IOHK will maintain a single official client, but there is also room for third-party alternative clients maintained by the community.
The Bootstrap era is the period of Cardano SL existence that allows only fixed predefined users to have control over the system.
The next era after Bootstrap is called the Reward era. Reward era is actually a “normal” operation mode of Cardano SL as a PoS-cryptocurrency.
After the Bootstrap era, the Reward era will start. During this time, the network will operate in a completely decentralized, trustless mode. “We expect staking pools to emerge during this era, allowing stakeholders with little stake to get rewards as stakeholders with large stake keep their nodes online to maintain the protocol in a decentralized fashion.”
The system will receive regular software updates moving forward, and a massive amount of new features will be released in the near future.
Though Cardano SL is designed and implemented as a distributed network, for purpose of DDoS protection additional facilities were added to Cardano SL implementation and topology.
Currently all nodes are divided into 3 groups:
Core Nodes:
“We bring additional security level around this set of core nodes: we put them inside a perimeter of relay nodes, so core nodes are isolated from the public internet and only relay nodes are allowed to communicate with core nodes. This is how we reduce probability for them being attacked.”
Core nodes never create currency transactions.
Relay Nodes:
You can think of relay nodes as of proxy between core nodes and public internet.
Since relay nodes are not isolated, they can be attacked, but they are in principle stateless and do not have any stake, so they can be moved, or their number can be increased.
If relays are taken down, this does deny service, but the integrity of the core nodes (and the blockchain) should not be compromised.
Since relay nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders.
Cannot create currency transactions.
Relay nodes are fully under the control of the federated committee of initial stakeholders.
Edge Nodes:
Edge node is a simple node that anyone can run on their computer.
Only these nodes can create currency transactions.
Since edge nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders as well as relay nodes.
Edge nodes cannot directly communicate with core nodes, only with relay nodes and with other edge nodes.

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem. I'm also struggling to understand how the blockchain is persists as a whole if it is being partitioned into sub-blockchains.

But seeing Charles Hoskinson call somebody who is going against his point of view as someone "" who don't understand cryptocurrency"" in this sub-reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/7a2lr6/full_disclosure_on_the_cardano_labo_affiliation/ it is more likely that he will ask his team to downvote this comment because he don't want to listen to it. 

It is true that ADA is released prematurely, 2 years in the making and still lacking in a lot of aspects and that roadmap sold it to the investor's faces that this project is more of a ""please me I'm Charles Hoskinson"" project instead of pleasing the investors and buyers project. In short all of us who bought and invested here are his guinea pigs.

I'm a programmer with an MSc in software engineering, so while I don't specifically work within blockchain technology right now, I generally know what to look for in software projects, whitepapers and so forth.

&gt; No, it doesn't need to be distributed before it's ready and no, Charles doesn't need a million testers. He has paid employees at IOHK who could setup a network of real and virtual servers to test the network in house.

It has nothing at all to do with 'needing a million testers'. Of course they test things in-house. That aside, releasing something gradually into production is a tried-and-tested method that you will see any competent large-scale software project do (for example Facebook, Google, AWS, and various others if you need examples). Also, 'Charles' doesn't -- Cardano Foundation and IOHK do. This attempted character assassination is tiresome to read through.

&gt; The bootstrap era could have been accomplished via the staff at IOHK, you don't need billions of tokens and millions of dollars in investment to send a few tokens back and forth, because let's be honest, thats all the network can do at this point.

The bootstrap era _is_ being accomplished via IOHK, thats exactly what the bootstrap era is -- the nodes are being run by IOHK. Once Cardano switches to the reward era, nodes will start being run outside of IOHK. In order for a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to function correctly, the tokens underpinning the economic incentives of staking must be fairly and widely distributed amongst preferably a large number of holders. This was the case with NXT, with BlackCoin, it is the case with NEO, and it will be the case for any other proof-of-stake algorithm relying on a fair and wide distribution of tokens.

&gt; Maybe if there was a basic smart contract platform to test, or maybe if there was even a proof of stake system that worked, then you could justify getting the public involved. But none of those things exist. None! None! None!

By this argument, no blockchain project without fee rewards for staking and active smart contracts is worth being public. By that notion, there are only a very, very, very small number of blockchain projects that 'justify' getting the public involved; and that list does _not_ include bitcoin, ethereum, or any of the current blockchains at all. Ethereum has smart contracts but not PoS, NEO has smart contracts but only bootstrap-era PoS, and so on, and so on. In short, what you're saying makes zero sense and has no bearing on reality.

&gt; Honestly if this project were at this point and being lead by anybody other than Charles, co-founder of Ethereum, this would be a total scam. You would be labeled a scam coin and you know it.

Reasons I care about Cardano:

- It has an active, involved research community counting some of the brightest people on the planet, including the two gentlemen I mentioned at the top.
- They have an _extremely_ active Github, telling me there is a ton of programming activity in the project. Far, far, far more than I've seen in most other crypto projects, by miles.
- They have individuals from Well Typed involved in the project, which are top Haskell consultants with a proven track record.
- They have been exceedingly clear in their communication, their widespread efforts to detail what they are doing and importantly _how_. The how is important, because this space is filled with a ton of bullshit and empty promises, and the how is partway to proving that Cardano is not in that category.

In my opinion, Cardano is one of few projects that have a chance at surviving for a longer time in this space and making real, serious contributions; that may not satisfy moonboys and daytraders, or those creating random accounts to shill or FUD -- but at the end of the day 90% of the companies that spring up around ICOs right now will be dead by the end of 2018, because they have no idea how they're going to do what they sold their ICO on. I'm betting on Cardano not being one of the dead ones, not least because of the points above.",True,,,,0,1509763719,,False,0,dpbjr63,False,t3_7ac7kj,t1_dpabjgr,1512109179,23,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7ac7kj/official_cardano_roadmap_discussion_thread/dpbjr63/,,public
,cardanojohn,,,,"Cardano does currently have a very high Asian participation. Thats because the project was germinated from the idea that the Asian market was ripe and open for new financial stack and had not been saturated by cryptocurrencies like the west. A cryptocurrency that succeeded in this might go onto transforming developing regions by offering those who are ignored by traditional banks blockchain enabled financial services. 

Then from a regulatory perspective as well, there are benefits to Cardano from having done the pre-sale in countries where there is no question of whether such a sale is legitimate. With no US participation in the sale, it also alleviates some of the SEC pressures which other cryptocurrencies have faced by performing ICO’s with Americans. The sale was performed by a Japanese entity who performed detailed KYC checks. This means they knew the difference between the amount of transactions and people. So for example, there were roughly 14K transactions that occurred over different tranches. With other cryptocurrencies, 8k of those could have been from a single person, creating a huge inequality in distribution. With Cardano we know that 9,912 people that participated, because they all went through compliance.

Cardano is not unique in having a geographic centre for its pre sale, Filecoin which was 100% US. What started in Asia, has now become global. You have an opportunity to purchase tokens on Bittrex and soon a number of other exchanges. Cardano is focused on become an industrial strength blockchain that can operate in regulated industries. The way in which the sale was performed with KYC and compliance will only be helpful to that aspiration.

Most of cryptos are just a speculation vehicle at the moment. They are not even doing what is promised that they will do. They release an ICO and people just trade the coins. Cardano rocks, any human being with common sense will say this.

It’s already set up for having some kind of treasury. If that is the case, then a country adopting the platform won’t adopt the currency that comes with it. They’ll ask to use the platform for their own currency. That doesn’t mean ADA won’t have a value of its own on the side. But don’t expect it to become the de facto nor de jure currency of say Japan.

So we have to value Cardano in two ways. One is the platform, which I think will be great and used by organizations. The other thing is the currency currency implemented (ADA).

They usually work 1 of 2 ways, setting an arbitrary date (usually set by some executives to line up with holidays or whatever) or not announcing a release date until most  of the project is done. The former always results in unfinished shitty work but it usually is good enough for most businesses. It seems cardano has chosen the latter and for a project this complex it was the correct decision. 

As for not giving enough information, you guys are not looking closely enough. Each of the features of shelley have a github repo and a research paper. Meaning they have done some of the work and the research already. 

I imagine as we get closer to 2018 and move into q1 we will receive more specific timelines for shelley as they will have a better understanding of what exactly needs to be finished.

Now I understand maybe there was some miscommunication on what this roadmap would include. And they can improve on that for the next roadmap.

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem. I'm also struggling to understand how the blockchain is persists as a whole if it is being partitioned into sub-blockchains.

    We've tracked this long enough now to project the value of the 
    asset overall in 3-stages. Market cap ranges of $650mm in stage 
    1, $4billion in stage 2, and closer to $42-44billion for stage 3 
    (2019-2020). ADA is no joke, but it's structured to end up 
    topping out at about $1.00USD total in value for the ADA asset, 
    from what we can see. This will allow an ADA to compete with 
    the global economic space (FIAT side) a lot easier than someone 
    looking at a BTC for $5,000 -$7500 down the road.

Two questions, one on IELE and one on K:

- There are a _lot_ of virtual machines being built by various crypto projects (Neo has its own VM, Ethereum has its own VM, etc etc), all of which share underlying common goals but may differ in the instruction set, semantics of the VM and so forth. Do you see this landscape consolidating somewhat in the future into some more robust, common virtual machines? And is IELE meant to be specific to Cardano, or do you see it as a thing of its own that can then potentially be used by others outside of Cardano?

- The article says that Runtime Verification is looking to build an improved backend to K that is an order of magnitude faster.

When people note the huge supply, they for some reason seem to think that value will be negatively affected.  This is incorrect and is most certainly not the case.  What will effect the value of the coin: 

1. Technological advancement that goes beyond the realms of the other coins.
2.  Networking and forming strategic partnerships with the right worldly establishments and perhaps even fellow competitors. 
3.  Effective promotion of the product and it's applications on a global level.
4.  Standing out from the crowd and delivering timeously in terms of the set out roadmap.

If the world comes to know and trust the product, in time it'll become extremely valuable.

The layer that holds ADA has been live for a little while now and the Cardano people are working hard to keep up with minor bugs and software development, as well as all the other things a block chain dev and research team  deals with.

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

,demetrius2012,,,,"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The roadmap provided alot of what people expected, and few surprises - this is fine from my point of view. There are a few areas I would consider working on moving forward: 

1. Make interviews/videos shorter. There are too many 45 minute videos explaining exactly the same thing about ADA (and frankly, with too much fluff on 3rd gen blockchain and not enough emphasis on quick comparisons of how ADA shakes up the market). Give people 5 minute clips and make this feel accessible. For instance, if you release a roadmap and have a month where no software is being released and just a countdown clock is running, I would think you could take each of the key sections of that section of the roadmap and build out a small series of 5 minute videos explaining why each component matters, and emphasize why each release must occur in that specific order for ADA to succeed. The team is doing advanced stuff and the general public simply doesn't understand all of it - make the value proposition more tangible (i.e. sure, we could release smart contracts tomorrow, but that would lead to x,y,z so it must be done like this). Shorter videos allow systematic deconstruction of invalid points and time to assess where value creation is occurring - for Cardano, alot of that value creation is in the way it is being developed and this is super intangible to ""normal people"" despite its importance. 

2. If you don't find a way of building off the roadmap each month through video explanations of each section, or weekly questions on each portion of the roadmap, then I honestly think you should drop the countdown clock. It doesn't mean anything other than hype and I am not a fan of coins with verbal hype and no releases to back it up. A website with no release dates and generic time frames that are 6 months out aren't too helpful with a coin this new. I think guaranteed quarterly or 6 month software releases would be more meaningful. 

3. If you keep up the the roadmaps, release more information. A roadmap changes, sure. But inviting the community to comment on something where we don't even actually know where you are headed, makes it difficult to provide feedback. Every decision has a ripple effect. We are looking at a small snapshot of the ADA vision, so how can we say whether or not this first section of the roadmap is appropriate or not since we don't know how it is meant to plug in to the future releases? I think a minimum of a 1 year vision should be in a roadmap so the community can actually see where things are going and provide real feedback on priorities. 

4. Keep up the community engagement. It has been great to have so many members of the IOHK team available to answer questions on here and to engage the community.

I saw mentions about Cardano Labo in Slack, so I will explain here about Cardano Labs (or Labo).

Cardano Labo was originally a project started by Japanese businessmen who knew of the project early on and were big fans of the Cardano vision. They wanted to build a blockchain solution on Cardano when the computation layer was completed, however due to delays in development, Cardano Labo decided to proceed with other protocols and change its corporate name to Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore the possibilities of developing applications with multiple platforms, then eventually became a major player in the Vietnamese blockchain community.
There is no commercial or capital affiliation between Cardano Labo and any of the Cardano project entities to this date.
With the Cardano Computation Layer drawing near, Emurgo has been in contact with Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore possibilities of collaboration to develop DApps and smart contracts on Cardano. We are excited about the possibility to work with Infinity Blockchain Labs as they have established a strong presence and reputation in the Vietnamese blockchain and fintech industries.

&gt; But why did you say:
&gt;&gt; some are also published in journals

/u/ethereumcharles didn't - I did. Charles is not me, and I (as I wrote) am not associated with Cardano or IOHK. I haphazardly used the concept of journal publishing as an overarching concept, that's my bad. Replace the word 'journal' with 'computer science conference' and the same thing applies similarly, as Charles has mentioned also.

To answer one of your original questions in the OP, peer review results are not published anywhere I've ever seen. If you are peer-reviewed as part of submitting a paper to a conference or journal, you usually receive feedback in the form of anonymized meta-reviewers, and that feedback is not meant to be publicized. Doing so would probably get your paper rejected instantly. The paper is revised based on the feedback (or not) and depending on need, and then either plain accepted or rejected in a follow-up round. Some conferences abide by this kind of approval process, others are simply accept/reject based on review. Peer review is not like auditing; in auditing, the result is the audit itself, which should be read. In review, the result is that either the paper is accepted (stamp of approval) or rejected. It's a filtering mechanism, whereby there is a greater probability that you can trust the work of the papers that make it through the filter.

Of course, you should still use sound scientific process and check the authors of the paper, what else they've published, read the articles and see what and who they cite, and check whether anyone else has cited the article itself yet (unlikely for new, bleeding-edge things). You should check their academic background, and what they're hired to do as researcherrs. You'll have to do all that on your own time, though, not going to do that for you :) If you did all of the above, you'd find that the papers Cardano produces are generally of a good, sound and academic quality and most other papers in the crypto space are cringeworthy for any academic to read in comparison. This bodes well for the space as a whole, and hopefully it catches on elsewhere too, so we can collectively push for higher standards. 

This isn't to say that Cardano is the _only_ place producing sound quality papers in crypto, at all. There are some very solid ones floating around that don't seem appropriate to mention here. The norm, however, looks like a bachelor's students first year at University or below - which is striking when you think about how much money some of those (white)papers raise subsequently!",True,,,,0,1511196826,,1511197027,0,dq3icp5,False,t3_7dzlvt,t1_dq3aota,1512836211,2,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7dzlvt/since_cardano_puts_so_much_emphasis_on_using/dq3icp5/,,public

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"Even though your account seems to be doing nothing here except trolling, I'm going to respond anyway in case someone happens by your post and goes, 'Hey why IS that'. Full disclosure: I have no affiliation with Cardano, I don't currently own any ADA, and Cardano didn't catch my eye because of Charles Hoskinson at all, but because of Philip Wadler and Elias Koutsoupias who are world-leading researchers within their respective fields of programming language theory and game theory. I'm a programmer with an MSc in software engineering, so while I don't specifically work within blockchain technology right now, I generally know what to look for in software projects, whitepapers and so forth.

&gt; No, it doesn't need to be distributed before it's ready and no, Charles doesn't need a million testers. He has paid employees at IOHK who could setup a network of real and virtual servers to test the network in house.

It has nothing at all to do with 'needing a million testers'. Of course they test things in-house. That aside, releasing something gradually into production is a tried-and-tested method that you will see any competent large-scale software project do (for example Facebook, Google, AWS, and various others if you need examples). Also, 'Charles' doesn't -- Cardano Foundation and IOHK do. This attempted character assassination is tiresome to read through.

&gt; The bootstrap era could have been accomplished via the staff at IOHK, you don't need billions of tokens and millions of dollars in investment to send a few tokens back and forth, because let's be honest, thats all the network can do at this point.

The bootstrap era _is_ being accomplished via IOHK, thats exactly what the bootstrap era is -- the nodes are being run by IOHK. Once Cardano switches to the reward era, nodes will start being run outside of IOHK. In order for a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to function correctly, the tokens underpinning the economic incentives of staking must be fairly and widely distributed amongst preferably a large number of holders. This was the case with NXT, with BlackCoin, it is the case with NEO, and it will be the case for any other proof-of-stake algorithm relying on a fair and wide distribution of tokens.

&gt; Maybe if there was a basic smart contract platform to test, or maybe if there was even a proof of stake system that worked, then you could justify getting the public involved. But none of those things exist. None! None! None!

By this argument, no blockchain project without fee rewards for staking and active smart contracts is worth being public. By that notion, there are only a very, very, very small number of blockchain projects that 'justify' getting the public involved; and that list does _not_ include bitcoin, ethereum, or any of the current blockchains at all. Ethereum has smart contracts but not PoS, NEO has smart contracts but only bootstrap-era PoS, and so on, and so on. In short, what you're saying makes zero sense and has no bearing on reality.

&gt; Honestly if this project were at this point and being lead by anybody other than Charles, co-founder of Ethereum, this would be a total scam. You would be labeled a scam coin and you know it.

Reasons I care about Cardano:

- It has an active, involved research community counting some of the brightest people on the planet, including the two gentlemen I mentioned at the top.
- They have an _extremely_ active Github, telling me there is a ton of programming activity in the project. Far, far, far more than I've seen in most other crypto projects, by miles.
- They have individuals from Well Typed involved in the project, which are top Haskell consultants with a proven track record.
- They have been exceedingly clear in their communication, their widespread efforts to detail what they are doing and importantly _how_. The how is important, because this space is filled with a ton of bullshit and empty promises, and the how is partway to proving that Cardano is not in that category.

In my opinion, Cardano is one of few projects that have a chance at surviving for a longer time in this space and making real, serious contributions; that may not satisfy moonboys and daytraders, or those creating random accounts to shill or FUD -- but at the end of the day 90% of the companies that spring up around ICOs right now will be dead by the end of 2018, because they have no idea how they're going to do what they sold their ICO on.

I think this efficiency will also work it's way into everyday person to person communication, so we won't have to waste time calling a liar a liar, which frankly, I think we all tire of.

I am encouraged by the development of technology, like Cardano, that will force obsolescence onto all of the insecure and power hungry who use confusion and ignorance to retain control.  :-)",False,,,,0,1509864503,,False,0,dpdb008,False,t3_7aw24j,t1_dpdarg2,1512141984,5,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7aw24j/cardanoada_useful/dpdb008/,,public

    We've tracked this long enough now to project the value of the 
    asset overall in 3-stages. Market cap ranges of $650mm in stage 
    1, $4billion in stage 2, and closer to $42-44billion for stage 3 
    (2019-2020). ADA is no joke, but it's structured to end up 
    topping out at about $1.00USD total in value for the ADA asset, 
    from what we can see. This will allow an ADA to compete with 
    the global economic space (FIAT side) a lot easier than someone 
    looking at a BTC for $5,000 -$7500 down the road.
    Something to think about.

I’ve heard that there will be a Japanese launch day (October 14th) is that correct? 

 We need to structure the subreddit with a list of upcoming events. Slack channel needs less redundant channels (1-2-3 for each is too much). We have around 700 members in this sub, it is time to create a strong community based on constructive discussions.

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

NEO allows many programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, Java, Javascript and python and others and uses the .NET framework, many developers are able to write smart contracts for NEO.  
    
NEO also has a token standard like ETH has ERC20, NEP5 in NEOs case. Which will encourage dApps to make use of a standardized model for tokens that can be used in the NEO wallet and make full use of their smart contract platform and be easily able to communicate with each other.     
  
While I don't know how many tx/sec Cardano can handle, NEO can handle at least 1000tx/sec which should be more than sufficient for now, but they'll improve it to 10000tx/sec.     
  
NEO also provided dividends in the form of GAS (the fuel for the NEO platform) which means that there won't be any inflation of new NEO being printed which would dilute the value of your holdings. Intitial GAS is distributed to all NEO holders until 100 million GAS is printed, and all GAS used by the network (as smart contract fees and such) is distributed among NEO holders. So holding NEO is literally holding a share in the network, and it literally rewards you for holding it by paying you dividends over the usage of the network. It's therefore a real investment unlike most shitcoins who do not return any real value.

Hello and welcome to the Cardano(ADA) forum;

My name is Charlie and the purpose of running this forum is to help people understand ADA better as well as promoting this cryptocurrency.
Personally I see a great potential in this cryptocurrency and would like to gather ADA fans in this place, so that everyone of us can benefit from the information shared by other users here. Also it would be ideal if traders can come here and provide their analysis of the market. Besides Cardano's technology is unique, we can build a better future for ADA together.  Smiley

Cardano's team have their own official topics on reddit.com and other forums, but none of them have a warm and friendly environment.
The forum has got simple rules, like any other forums. Please do no spam, do not advertise and do not post any referral links here.

,Sunrise2020,,,,"Hi, this is ID Sunrise2020.  First of all,  I’d like to thank you for this chance to talk about Cardano roadmap...

1.  After count down, maybe I feel that many people thought that they could find a new information or concrete contents especially about the project or future plan, for example,’ATM will be available in December’ or ‘ A University of Illinois startup founded by computer science professor Grigore Rosu, and IOHK, a leading blockchain research and development company, are partnering to design a next-generation virtual machine called IELE and a universal language framework to be used as core infrastructure for future blockchain technologies,funding from NASA, Boeing and Toyota and so on...’.   Maybe the information on roadmap may be different from what we want to get and know,,,because it 
presents mainly technical information more than the one about easy-to-understand information for common people who do not understand about cryptcurrency or blockchain...


2. When we read a newspaper, we can easily understand the main idea if we read a headlines..
Maybe there are so many information in roadmap, so many people cannot easily understand main idea...if possible, 
clear and concise text and  contents of an article is better for us...

3.  high-impact marketing technique

If more news about IELE in details is used in the roadmap, more people may think Cardano is GREAT!
Almost all common people are mainly interested in the news that makes a good impact on market..
The future project or present project,,,we need not so many information at a time..
If Headlines and short explanation on the roadmap, it is better for us because we can understand easily.

For investor and developer or researcher...people want or need different kinds of  information depending on where one stands.  We are all investors...

4. ADA price trend
We, investors, almost all are interested in price trend...if investors get good news about the project, more people trust and understand Cardano,,and if they get bad news, they worry...and finally such a news also make an influence on price trend sometimes....we keep ADA and will keep them for a long time from now on also...because Cardano project is great!  So we invest to support Cardano and ADA...if we can increase the value of Cardano and ADA, every members in Cardano are happy, I think. And the values....it’s ithe values of Cardano project and the value of ADA as assets for us, investors...

5.  marketing effectiveness is also needed for the future

Marketing development and making marketing more effective is needed  in order to make more people understand Cardano project...even if the team can have enough ability to creat wonderful project, they can hardly attract plants and firms to Cardano, or cannot attract investment in the project from company if marketing is not effective for the world..

That’s all I want to say about the roadmap...Hope next roadmap will be better for every members...

For example, My idea is next if I add the news in roadmap as a headlines...↓

The layer that holds ADA has been live for a little while now and the Cardano people are working hard to keep up with minor bugs and software development, as well as all the other things a block chain dev and research team  deals with.

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

Speaking after his presentation, Professor Kiayias said: “We’re very happy that we had the opportunity to present Ouroboros at the conference. The protocol and especially its security analysis were very well received by fellow cryptographers.”

“Our next steps will be to focus on the next version of the protocol, Ouroboros Praos which improves even further the security and performance characteristics of the protocol.”

The Ouroboros protocol stands out as the first proof of stake algorithm that is provably secure, meaning that it offers security guarantees that are mathematically proven. This is essential for a protocol that is intended to be used in cryptocurrency, an infrastructure that must be relied on to carry billions of dollars worth of value. In addition to security, if blockchains are going to become infrastructure for new financial systems they must be able to comfortably handle millions of users. The key to scaling up is proof of stake, a far more energy efficient and cost effective algorithm, and as such this research represents a significant step forward in cryptography.

- Built with Haskell, allowing formal verification of a lot of core aspects of the blockchain. This is important! As an example, IOHK also built a formal verification system for the Ethereum VM (KEVM), and found several errors in the EVM. Errors in the core aspects of the blockchain are bad news bears.

- IOHK are either employing or cooperating with Well Typed, one of the world's leading Haskell consultancies.

- IOHK researchers include some of the world's top minds within programming language research and algorithmic game theory. Outside of Microsoft and IBM's initiatives (and I have no idea who they enlist), I have yet to see any blockchain that has even remotely close to this level of academic research power. In practice what this means is that what they are building will come across as, and indeed probably be, a lot more trustworthy. This is work backed up by serious research and good ideas, not just good ideas.

The primary assumption going wrong in peoples mind, I find, is that existing blockchain products are 'good enough'. They're great ideas, but they are rudimentary and basic; they are the first steps. Nothing wrong with this, mind. We're going to see a LOT of evolution in this area, not just from Cardano/IOHK, but also from Hyperledger and other initiatives. 

As a programmer and academic, some of the choices Ethereum (and consequently also NEO) has made wrt. the way the scripting language and VMs work deeply puzzle me, making compile-time verification of contracts very hard, making the attack surface of the VM extremely large, and in general just making it very, very easy to make mistakes. This can and already has led to a LOT of problems, i.e., people losing a lot of money. Importantly, this weakens trust in the contract language.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"Even though your account seems to be doing nothing here except trolling, I'm going to respond anyway in case someone happens by your post and goes, 'Hey why IS that'. Full disclosure: I have no affiliation with Cardano, I don't currently own any ADA, and Cardano didn't catch my eye because of Charles Hoskinson at all, but because of Philip Wadler and Elias Koutsoupias who are world-leading researchers within their respective fields of programming language theory and game theory. I'm a programmer with an MSc in software engineering, so while I don't specifically work within blockchain technology right now, I generally know what to look for in software projects, whitepapers and so forth.

&gt; No, it doesn't need to be distributed before it's ready and no, Charles doesn't need a million testers. He has paid employees at IOHK who could setup a network of real and virtual servers to test the network in house.

It has nothing at all to do with 'needing a million testers'. Of course they test things in-house. That aside, releasing something gradually into production is a tried-and-tested method that you will see any competent large-scale software project do (for example Facebook, Google, AWS, and various others if you need examples). Also, 'Charles' doesn't -- Cardano Foundation and IOHK do. This attempted character assassination is tiresome to read through.

&gt; The bootstrap era could have been accomplished via the staff at IOHK, you don't need billions of tokens and millions of dollars in investment to send a few tokens back and forth, because let's be honest, thats all the network can do at this point.

The bootstrap era _is_ being accomplished via IOHK, thats exactly what the bootstrap era is -- the nodes are being run by IOHK. Once Cardano switches to the reward era, nodes will start being run outside of IOHK. In order for a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to function correctly, the tokens underpinning the economic incentives of staking must be fairly and widely distributed amongst preferably a large number of holders. This was the case with NXT, with BlackCoin, it is the case with NEO, and it will be the case for any other proof-of-stake algorithm relying on a fair and wide distribution of tokens.

&gt; Maybe if there was a basic smart contract platform to test, or maybe if there was even a proof of stake system that worked, then you could justify getting the public involved. But none of those things exist. None! None! None!

By this argument, no blockchain project without fee rewards for staking and active smart contracts is worth being public. By that notion, there are only a very, very, very small number of blockchain projects that 'justify' getting the public involved; and that list does _not_ include bitcoin, ethereum, or any of the current blockchains at all. Ethereum has smart contracts but not PoS, NEO has smart contracts but only bootstrap-era PoS, and so on, and so on. In short, what you're saying makes zero sense and has no bearing on reality.

&gt; Honestly if this project were at this point and being lead by anybody other than Charles, co-founder of Ethereum, this would be a total scam. You would be labeled a scam coin and you know it.

Reasons I care about Cardano:

- It has an active, involved research community counting some of the brightest people on the planet, including the two gentlemen I mentioned at the top.
- They have an _extremely_ active Github, telling me there is a ton of programming activity in the project. Far, far, far more than I've seen in most other crypto projects, by miles.
- They have individuals from Well Typed involved in the project, which are top Haskell consultants with a proven track record.
- They have been exceedingly clear in their communication, their widespread efforts to detail what they are doing and importantly _how_. The how is important, because this space is filled with a ton of bullshit and empty promises, and the how is partway to proving that Cardano is not in that category.

In my opinion, Cardano is one of few projects that have a chance at surviving for a longer time in this space and making real, serious contributions; that may not satisfy moonboys and daytraders, or those creating random accounts to shill or FUD -- but at the end of the day 90% of the companies that spring up around ICOs right now will be dead by the end of 2018, because they have no idea how they're going to do what they sold their ICO on.

In the crypto market there are many project. They have the same vision of a better economy and this is the point.

We have to thinking in a new way of coevolution and diversity. 

For this thinking you need knowledge about the old economy and there problems for example exponential growth, monopoly, cheap money, centralism and morbid competition. 

I think there are many projects if they grow the hole ecosystem grows and Cardano is one of them.

Cardano is a great project with a great academic foundation the want a better economy where nobody wasted time and energy.

,FyarGyal,,,,"Things appear to be a bit murky!

I must say at the outset:
1) I have enjoyed watching and listening to Charles Hoskinson over the past couple of years (youTube and so on) - impressive, persuasive.
2) I hold no ADA, so have no skin in the game. However, I hold a few ETCs, so I have some interest.

I have little doubt that Charles was involved with ""Cardano Gaming Group"" (see icedbeverage comment elsewhere, or follow directly here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZqIeZQXHk published by Attain Corporation, 21 Dec 2015).
I commend icedbeverage for his comment: ""This is not fud these are valid concerns. [This video has] ... Hoskinson in them and they talk about a gaming platform. We need to know the full history and if there was anything sketchy or fraudulent.""

By some accounts at the time (about July/ August 2016), CARDANO ADA coin from Cardano Gaming Group somehow failed to deliver and left many Japanese who had invested in it disgruntled (see note 1 below). 

Wukifnee: if you are one of the (allegedly) disgruntled investors, I sympathize.
 
To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.

By the way, there is a company ""CGG Limited"" registered in the Isle of Man, previously named ""Cardano Gaming Group Limited"" and previous to that ""Cardano Limited"" - documents available for download for a modest fee at https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=331585

The Isle of Man info above may be a red herring, however on the face of it, it may be worth looking into, if you're so inclined/ motivated.

I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular , but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation, which would involve (inter-alia) searching japanese language websites in a focussed way.

So do your research wukifnee, contact others, try and build a case and if/ when you feel you have one, apply your information wisely. I wish you good luck.

In order for this project to be successful in the future, it should be preceded by creating an environment in which the ADA coin can be used and allowing it to be retained by many people.

2. You have to worry about what kind of incentives will be given to the holder who loves Cardano and strives for marketing with affection.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"- Peer-reviewed PoS algorithm. Seems to be the first PoS algorithm to solve a lot of the outstanding issues with PoS.

- Built with Haskell, allowing formal verification of a lot of core aspects of the blockchain. This is important! As an example, IOHK also built a formal verification system for the Ethereum VM (KEVM), and found several errors in the EVM. Errors in the core aspects of the blockchain are bad news bears.

- IOHK are either employing or cooperating with Well Typed, one of the world's leading Haskell consultancies.

- IOHK researchers include some of the world's top minds within programming language research and algorithmic game theory. Outside of Microsoft and IBM's initiatives (and I have no idea who they enlist), I have yet to see any blockchain that has even remotely close to this level of academic research power. In practice what this means is that what they are building will come across as, and indeed probably be, a lot more trustworthy. This is work backed up by serious research and good ideas, not just good ideas.

The primary assumption going wrong in peoples mind, I find, is that existing blockchain products are 'good enough'. They're great ideas, but they are rudimentary and basic; they are the first steps. Nothing wrong with this, mind. We're going to see a LOT of evolution in this area, not just from Cardano/IOHK, but also from Hyperledger and other initiatives. 

As a programmer and academic, some of the choices Ethereum (and consequently also NEO) has made wrt. the way the scripting language and VMs work deeply puzzle me, making compile-time verification of contracts very hard, making the attack surface of the VM extremely large, and in general just making it very, very easy to make mistakes. This can and already has led to a LOT of problems, i.e., people losing a lot of money. Importantly, this weakens trust in the contract language. At the same time, academia has worked on contract languages for dozens of years now - so there's really no need to re-invent the wheel to such a degree.

,parakmiakos_trader,,,,"Very nice example of how growth works. Just to add to what I was saying before in regards to growth. Potential adopters of Cardano and people in general that do not understand how growth as you explained it works, see the price of the coin being about 3 cents now and they calculate quickly the market cap required for the coin to reach ethereum's price of $300 and work out that the market cap would have to be huge to reach to that price per ADA. What they don't take into consideration is the percentage growth of the coin it self and factor that percentage into their investment to work out their potential profits ie

I will spend $1000 to buy some ADA now ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 33,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs 30 cents = (33,333 coins X $0.3 per coin = $9,999) 
I made a profit of $9,999 - $1000 initial investment = $8,999



Now let's go to Ethereum

I will spend $1000 to buy some ETH now ($1000 at $300 per coin = roughly 3.33 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $3000 = (3.33 coins X $3000 per coin = $9,990)
I made a profit of $9,990 - $1000 initial investment = $ 8,990

Notice how 1 ADA had to go from 0.03 cents to 0.3 cents and 1 ETH had to go from $300 to $3000 TO MAKE THE SAME profit roughly. The growth of both coins was 10 times up.





Now let's start with both coins from let's say $0.03 with an initial investment of $1000

I will spend $1000 to buy ADA ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ADA coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $9.3337451e+12. This is not going to happen anytime soon. So IMHO, people should not expect to see 1 ADA costing $300. Which is what Ethereum costs today. The Ethereum boat has sailed. Unless if you want to speculate on the hundreds of ALTcoins out there: https://coinmarketcap.com/ .Who knows, you might get lucky.





I will spend $1000 to buy ETH ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I just made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ETH coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $28620880200. Which is roughly Ethereum's market cap today.



Ethereum tokens can cost $300 each because the total supply of ETH at the moment is 95,402,934 ETH (millions)
ADA tokens total supply is 31,112,483,745 ADA (billions). Which means a looot of people need to be invested in Cardano, for the price to go higher and higher...which means Cardano will have to go mainstream(they are just starting out). Well guess what, cryptos have been around long enough, the world is aware of them, so it might be time to go mainstream. This would require serious people with serious connections backing a blockchain project, as it is a big responsibility. Well these guys at Cardano seem to fulfill the criteria. (you need to reasearch them too, to form your own opinion).

Making profits from buying crypto coins is good, but we should be thinking about how our world will be affected by new technologies yes?


If you are a newbie trying to ride the hype, have a look at all those projects out there on  https://coinmarketcap.com. Make sure you research extensively the ones you might be interested in, and you will realize a whole heap of them are just a joke(there are solid ones too though), trying to make money. That's your money.


If you ask me what the future of the price of ADA will be in let's say the next two years, I am not sure!! I keep googling it but nothing comes up:P


Maybe the Cardano people can help us out here, and I don't believe they will, because they will be speculating which is something they can't do.

,Sunrise2020,,,,"Hi, this is ID Sunrise2020.  First of all,  I’d like to thank you for this chance to talk about Cardano roadmap...

1.  After count down, maybe I feel that many people thought that they could find a new information or concrete contents especially about the project or future plan, for example,’ATM will be available in December’ or ‘ A University of Illinois startup founded by computer science professor Grigore Rosu, and IOHK, a leading blockchain research and development company, are partnering to design a next-generation virtual machine called IELE and a universal language framework to be used as core infrastructure for future blockchain technologies,funding from NASA, Boeing and Toyota and so on...’.   Maybe the information on roadmap may be different from what we want to get and know,,,because it 
presents mainly technical information more than the one about easy-to-understand information for common people who do not understand about cryptcurrency or blockchain...


2. When we read a newspaper, we can easily understand the main idea if we read a headlines..
Maybe there are so many information in roadmap, so many people cannot easily understand main idea...if possible, 
clear and concise text and  contents of an article is better for us...

3.  high-impact marketing technique

If more news about IELE in details is used in the roadmap, more people may think Cardano is GREAT!
Almost all common people are mainly interested in the news that makes a good impact on market..
The future project or present project,,,we need not so many information at a time..
If Headlines and short explanation on the roadmap, it is better for us because we can understand easily.

For investor and developer or researcher...people want or need different kinds of  information depending on where one stands.  We are all investors...

4. ADA price trend
We, investors, almost all are interested in price trend...if investors get good news about the project, more people trust and understand Cardano,,and if they get bad news, they worry...and finally such a news also make an influence on price trend sometimes....we keep ADA and will keep them for a long time from now on also...because Cardano project is great!  So we invest to support Cardano and ADA...if we can increase the value of Cardano and ADA, every members in Cardano are happy, I think. And the values....it’s ithe values of Cardano project and the value of ADA as assets for us, investors...

5.  marketing effectiveness is also needed for the future

Marketing development and making marketing more effective is needed  in order to make more people understand Cardano project...even if the team can have enough ability to creat wonderful project, they can hardly attract plants and firms to Cardano, or cannot attract investment in the project from company if marketing is not effective for the world..

That’s all I want to say about the roadmap...Hope next roadmap will be better for every members...

For example, My idea is next if I add the news in roadmap as a headlines...↓

It is true that ADA is released prematurely, 2 years in the making and still lacking in a lot of aspects and that roadmap sold it to the investor's faces that this project is more of a ""please me I'm Charles Hoskinson"" project instead of pleasing the investors and buyers project.

,parakmiakos_trader,,,,"Very nice example of how growth works. Just to add to what I was saying before in regards to growth. Potential adopters of Cardano and people in general that do not understand how growth as you explained it works, see the price of the coin being about 3 cents now and they calculate quickly the market cap required for the coin to reach ethereum's price of $300 and work out that the market cap would have to be huge to reach to that price per ADA. What they don't take into consideration is the percentage growth of the coin it self and factor that percentage into their investment to work out their potential profits ie

I will spend $1000 to buy some ADA now ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 33,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs 30 cents = (33,333 coins X $0.3 per coin = $9,999) 
I made a profit of $9,999 - $1000 initial investment = $8,999



Now let's go to Ethereum

I will spend $1000 to buy some ETH now ($1000 at $300 per coin = roughly 3.33 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $3000 = (3.33 coins X $3000 per coin = $9,990)
I made a profit of $9,990 - $1000 initial investment = $ 8,990

Notice how 1 ADA had to go from 0.03 cents to 0.3 cents and 1 ETH had to go from $300 to $3000 TO MAKE THE SAME profit roughly. The growth of both coins was 10 times up.





Now let's start with both coins from let's say $0.03 with an initial investment of $1000

I will spend $1000 to buy ADA ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ADA coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $9.3337451e+12. This is not going to happen anytime soon. So IMHO, people should not expect to see 1 ADA costing $300. Which is what Ethereum costs today. The Ethereum boat has sailed. Unless if you want to speculate on the hundreds of ALTcoins out there: https://coinmarketcap.com/ .Who knows, you might get lucky.





I will spend $1000 to buy ETH ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I just made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ETH coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $28620880200. Which is roughly Ethereum's market cap today.



Ethereum tokens can cost $300 each because the total supply of ETH at the moment is 95,402,934 ETH (millions)
ADA tokens total supply is 31,112,483,745 ADA (billions). Which means a looot of people need to be invested in Cardano, for the price to go higher and higher...which means Cardano will have to go mainstream(they are just starting out). Well guess what, cryptos have been around long enough, the world is aware of them, so it might be time to go mainstream. This would require serious people with serious connections backing a blockchain project, as it is a big responsibility. Well these guys at Cardano seem to fulfill the criteria. (you need to reasearch them too, to form your own opinion).

Making profits from buying crypto coins is good, but we should be thinking about how our world will be affected by new technologies yes?


If you are a newbie trying to ride the hype, have a look at all those projects out there on  https://coinmarketcap.com. Make sure you research extensively the ones you might be interested in, and you will realize a whole heap of them are just a joke(there are solid ones too though), trying to make money. That's your money.


If you ask me what the future of the price of ADA will be in let's say the next two years, I am not sure!! I keep googling it but nothing comes up:P


Maybe the Cardano people can help us out here, and I don't believe they will, because they will be speculating which is something they can't do.

,ngin-x,,,,"There are a lot of parameters to look at apart from marketcap. If marketcap was the sole criteria, you could go and invest in some 300 ranked coin. You have the potential to get 1000x in future then.

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

At this point, I would rather place my bets on Cardano with the kind of people Cardano has working for the project. Cardano is also not short on funds.

All I can say is - I sincerely hope Cardano/IOHK/etc aren't relying on these countdown clocks as the sole source of excitement for the community. No hype needed, but some sense of what will actually make this special needs to be made clear - and I don't mean consensus algorithms - only cryptonerds care about that kind of thing. We do need actual investors to buy in and prepare to stake. Heck, we need staking to actually be possible for people to see value because that's all we've got at the moment.

Support for decentralized market making to improve liquidity between UIA and the primary token.
“Our preliminary efforts for finding the right authenticated data structure have resulted in a new type of AVL+ Tree jointly developed by Leo Reyzin, IOHK and Waves. More research is required, but it is a foundational advancement that will be included in a later version of Cardano.”
“We expect — subject to research results — to include a protocol into Cardano for UIAs during the Basho of CSL release in 2018.”
“Our scalability goals for Cardano are greatly aided by our consensus algorithm.”
OUROBOROS
IOHK scientists led byProf. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros.
“Our proof of stake protocol is called Ouroboros and it has been designed by an extremely talented team of cryptographers from five academic institutions led by Professor Aggelos Kiayias of the University of Edinburgh. The core innovation it brings beyond being proven secure using a rigorous cryptographic model is a modular and flexible design that allows for the composition of many protocols to enhance functionality.”
Ouroboros permits a decentralized way to elect a quorum of consensus nodes, which in turn can run more traditional protocols developed over the last 20 years to accommodate the needs of large infrastructure providers such as Google and Facebook.
Ouroboros determines how individual nodes reach consensus about the network.
Ouroboros eliminates the need for an energy-hungry proof of work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for much wider use.
Ouroboros is the first proof of stake protocol that scientifically has been shown to be provably secure.
In terms of consensus, Ouroboros was designed in a sufficiently modular fashion to support smart contract evaluation.
“In our current roadmap, scaling methods will be applied to Ouroboros starting in 2018 and continue to be a focus in 2019 and 2020.”
Both CSL and CCL will share the same consensus algorithm. The difference is that Ouroboros can be confirmed to permit both permissioned and permissionless ledgers via token distribution.
The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has.
Cardano’s HSM strategy will be to attempt implemented specialized protocols over the next two years using Intel SGX and ARM Trustzone.
Both modules are built into billions of consumer devices from laptops to cellphones and require no additional effort on the consumer side to use.
Both are also heavily vetted, well designed and based upon years of iteration from some of the largest and best funded hardware security teams.
The use of HSMs to provide an identity space where PII is not leaked but yet used to authenticate and credential actors should provide a global reputation system and allow for much lower cost regulated activities to be conducted, such as online gaming with automated tax compliance or decentralized exchanges.
The Cardano ecosystem is developing out into the most complete and most useful cryptocurrency ever constructed.
DAEDALUS
To use Ada you must download the Daedalus digital wallet. Daedalus is a secure, HD wallet for the Ada cryptocurrency.
Daedalus wallet has many special features, which make it easy to use and give you a high degree of confidence about its security. These include:
Encrypted private keys and spending passwords, offering protection against security threats such as malware.
Wallets can be exported to paper certificates, giving the maximum security option of placing funds in cold storage.
Ada redemption is built directly into Daedalus and supports encrypted and unencrypted redemption certificates.
Configurable transaction assurance level monitoring, allowing users to be sure when transactions become irreversible.
Future releases of Daedalus will allow third party developers to build innovative applications directly for the wallet. Whether you would like micro credit, to set up recurring payments, or to exchange cryptocurrencies, it will be easy to customize your Daedalus experience.
Daedalus is built on top of Electron, a battle-proven open source development platform to build cross-platform desktop apps using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
You don’t have to be a specialist in cryptography and security to build amazing plugins for Daedalus. “We provide you with rich and secure APIs to interact with cryptocurrency backends.”
The core features of Daedalus are just the beginning. “Our goal is to give anyone the power to extend Daedalus with custom plugins, automation and literally any innovation you can come up with.”
“To keep the experience consistent for Daedalus users and simplify your development workflow, we have developed a small but flexible React UI framework that you can use to build beautiful plugins that just merge into the whole platform.”
You will be able to easily adjust the current color theme for all components in the Daedalus Design Language. The best thing about this: “Developers just have to follow our guidelines to use the component framework to make this work.”
“Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on or substantive review of any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.”
“Stake” gives a user the power to control various Cardano SL algorithm parts, for example: being the slot leader, voting in the Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC. This is why all thresholds in Cardano SL protocol are expressed in terms of stake, not balance.
“When we are talking about the ‘stake’, we are talking about a user’s ability to control Cardano SL.”
IOHK will maintain a single official client, but there is also room for third-party alternative clients maintained by the community.
The Bootstrap era is the period of Cardano SL existence that allows only fixed predefined users to have control over the system.
The next era after Bootstrap is called the Reward era. Reward era is actually a “normal” operation mode of Cardano SL as a PoS-cryptocurrency.
After the Bootstrap era, the Reward era will start. During this time, the network will operate in a completely decentralized, trustless mode. “We expect staking pools to emerge during this era, allowing stakeholders with little stake to get rewards as stakeholders with large stake keep their nodes online to maintain the protocol in a decentralized fashion.”
The system will receive regular software updates moving forward, and a massive amount of new features will be released in the near future.
Though Cardano SL is designed and implemented as a distributed network, for purpose of DDoS protection additional facilities were added to Cardano SL implementation and topology.
Currently all nodes are divided into 3 groups:
Core Nodes:
“We bring additional security level around this set of core nodes: we put them inside a perimeter of relay nodes, so core nodes are isolated from the public internet and only relay nodes are allowed to communicate with core nodes. This is how we reduce probability for them being attacked.”
Core nodes never create currency transactions.
Relay Nodes:
You can think of relay nodes as of proxy between core nodes and public internet.
Since relay nodes are not isolated, they can be attacked, but they are in principle stateless and do not have any stake, so they can be moved, or their number can be increased.
If relays are taken down, this does deny service, but the integrity of the core nodes (and the blockchain) should not be compromised.
Since relay nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders.
Cannot create currency transactions.
Relay nodes are fully under the control of the federated committee of initial stakeholders.
Edge Nodes:
Edge node is a simple node that anyone can run on their computer.
Only these nodes can create currency transactions.
Since edge nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders as well as relay nodes.
Edge nodes cannot directly communicate with core nodes, only with relay nodes and with other edge nodes.

&gt; But why did you say:
&gt;&gt; some are also published in journals

/u/ethereumcharles didn't - I did. Charles is not me, and I (as I wrote) am not associated with Cardano or IOHK. I haphazardly used the concept of journal publishing as an overarching concept, that's my bad. Replace the word 'journal' with 'computer science conference' and the same thing applies similarly, as Charles has mentioned also.

To answer one of your original questions in the OP, peer review results are not published anywhere I've ever seen. If you are peer-reviewed as part of submitting a paper to a conference or journal, you usually receive feedback in the form of anonymized meta-reviewers, and that feedback is not meant to be publicized. Doing so would probably get your paper rejected instantly. The paper is revised based on the feedback (or not) and depending on need, and then either plain accepted or rejected in a follow-up round. Some conferences abide by this kind of approval process, others are simply accept/reject based on review. Peer review is not like auditing; in auditing, the result is the audit itself, which should be read. In review, the result is that either the paper is accepted (stamp of approval) or rejected. It's a filtering mechanism, whereby there is a greater probability that you can trust the work of the papers that make it through the filter.

Of course, you should still use sound scientific process and check the authors of the paper, what else they've published, read the articles and see what and who they cite, and check whether anyone else has cited the article itself yet (unlikely for new, bleeding-edge things). You should check their academic background, and what they're hired to do as researcherrs. You'll have to do all that on your own time, though, not going to do that for you :) If you did all of the above, you'd find that the papers Cardano produces are generally of a good, sound and academic quality and most other papers in the crypto space are cringeworthy for any academic to read in comparison. This bodes well for the space as a whole, and hopefully it catches on elsewhere too, so we can collectively push for higher standards. 

This isn't to say that Cardano is the _only_ place producing sound quality papers in crypto, at all. There are some very solid ones floating around that don't seem appropriate to mention here.

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem.

Would you mind to answer these two questions in layman's terms:

- How hard is it for other crypto projects to adopt Cardano's PoS scheme. Any thoughts?
- How does Cardano compare in terms of scalability and privacy with other projects?

For ""other projects"" take Ethereum as the comparison, perhaps before and after the upcoming upgrades (Metropolis, PoS/PoW, integration with Zcash, i.e. ZoE, polkadot.)

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

At this point, I would rather place my bets on Cardano with the kind of people Cardano has working for the project. Cardano is also not short on funds.

Gr8!   Hi, wonderful news!   I am from Cardano community...   I add some new information about ADA on my Twitter,,,
If u would not mind, visit this and read FANTASTIC news!

@samurai2020 ADA


And another good news here,,,the BIG project with the university of Illinois proceeded for 15  years funded by NASA, BOEING, TOYOTA and so on...IOHK just joined it in order to proceed the project together about next generation virtual machine that will be available for the blockchain security!

https://paymentweek.com/2017-10-24-next-generation-virtual-machine-sets-future-standard-blockchain-development/


So selling ADA is really not better now,,,ADA is going to be available step by step!  Thanks a lot for reading the information!

,[deleted],,,,"Hi guys, as mentioned by others and reiterated by myself,  the Cardano project and the ADA coin, for now and in the near future is not going to make us rich in a short space of time.  We all need to understand that there are so many day traders in the marketplace, who actually buy and sell short term in order to make profit from the volatility.  At the moment in my opinion, the buy wall is based on opportunistic income generating transactions.   Now I urge all to be patient and keep hope and faith in the project, the coin and the team.  My gut knows without any doubt that we are going to be positively surprised in terms of the progress that ADA will make regarding value.  There is alot of work that needs to be done and surely IOHK and company know that it's not only about what tech they can develop.  Networking, and forging forward in strong partnerships with the right establishments, is going to help set the ADA ball rolling big time. The Cardano team are by no means a clown operation, they do have serious plans and whoever doesn't come to the Cardano party, buy and hold ADA, will be kicking themselves in time to come.  They're going to succeed, we all need to exercise patience and trust in their process. Mark my words 2021/2022, 1 x ADA will amount to in the region of $300.00 if not more.

&gt; When I saw the name of Basho as a Japanese, I was very happy.
I was looking forward to the roadmap announcement this time. I will expect it next time.
This announcement seemed to be great information for pre-sale and ADA owners who have been watching the development of CARDANO for a long time since launch. However, those who were recently aware of CARDANO and ADA felt that it is very difficult to be honest, what is written when seeing the contents, and what it means. I understand that the technical content is great, but what we do with it If we do not announce what we will be able to do as a platform, we can not predict what will be possible as a platform, I thought that I do not feel much attractive. As a matter of fact, a child was born this year and I'm attaching something called the Maternal and Child Handbook of Japan. Although it is different from the roadmap, it is something like an indicator, a record that shows the child growing properly, but it is very easy to understand. I would be pleased if the roadmap would be like a child like CARDANO and I could watch over the growth.

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem.

,cardanojohn,,,,"Cardano does currently have a very high Asian participation. Thats because the project was germinated from the idea that the Asian market was ripe and open for new financial stack and had not been saturated by cryptocurrencies like the west. A cryptocurrency that succeeded in this might go onto transforming developing regions by offering those who are ignored by traditional banks blockchain enabled financial services. 

Then from a regulatory perspective as well, there are benefits to Cardano from having done the pre-sale in countries where there is no question of whether such a sale is legitimate. With no US participation in the sale, it also alleviates some of the SEC pressures which other cryptocurrencies have faced by performing ICO’s with Americans. The sale was performed by a Japanese entity who performed detailed KYC checks. This means they knew the difference between the amount of transactions and people. So for example, there were roughly 14K transactions that occurred over different tranches. With other cryptocurrencies, 8k of those could have been from a single person, creating a huge inequality in distribution. With Cardano we know that 9,912 people that participated, because they all went through compliance.

Cardano is not unique in having a geographic centre for its pre sale, Filecoin which was 100% US. What started in Asia, has now become global. You have an opportunity to purchase tokens on Bittrex and soon a number of other exchanges. Cardano is focused on become an industrial strength blockchain that can operate in regulated industries. The way in which the sale was performed with KYC and compliance will only be helpful to that aspiration.

I saw mentions about Cardano Labo in Slack, so I will explain here about Cardano Labs (or Labo).

Cardano Labo was originally a project started by Japanese businessmen who knew of the project early on and were big fans of the Cardano vision. They wanted to build a blockchain solution on Cardano when the computation layer was completed, however due to delays in development, Cardano Labo decided to proceed with other protocols and change its corporate name to Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore the possibilities of developing applications with multiple platforms, then eventually became a major player in the Vietnamese blockchain community.
There is no commercial or capital affiliation between Cardano Labo and any of the Cardano project entities to this date.
With the Cardano Computation Layer drawing near, Emurgo has been in contact with Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore possibilities of collaboration to develop DApps and smart contracts on Cardano. We are excited about the possibility to work with Infinity Blockchain Labs as they have established a strong presence and reputation in the Vietnamese blockchain and fintech industries.

Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.  You will miss all the new coins and find your old #70-100 collection became an average of #120.

The layer that holds ADA has been live for a little while now and the Cardano people are working hard to keep up with minor bugs and software development, as well as all the other things a block chain dev and research team  deals with.

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

,FyarGyal,,,,"Things appear to be a bit murky!

I must say at the outset:
1) I have enjoyed watching and listening to Charles Hoskinson over the past couple of years (youTube and so on) - impressive, persuasive.
2) I hold no ADA, so have no skin in the game. However, I hold a few ETCs, so I have some interest.

I have little doubt that Charles was involved with ""Cardano Gaming Group"" (see icedbeverage comment elsewhere, or follow directly here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZqIeZQXHk published by Attain Corporation, 21 Dec 2015).
I commend icedbeverage for his comment: ""This is not fud these are valid concerns. [This video has] ... Hoskinson in them and they talk about a gaming platform. We need to know the full history and if there was anything sketchy or fraudulent.""

By some accounts at the time (about July/ August 2016), CARDANO ADA coin from Cardano Gaming Group somehow failed to deliver and left many Japanese who had invested in it disgruntled (see note 1 below). 

Wukifnee: if you are one of the (allegedly) disgruntled investors, I sympathize.
 
To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.

By the way, there is a company ""CGG Limited"" registered in the Isle of Man, previously named ""Cardano Gaming Group Limited"" and previous to that ""Cardano Limited"" - documents available for download for a modest fee at https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=331585

The Isle of Man info above may be a red herring, however on the face of it, it may be worth looking into, if you're so inclined/ motivated.

I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular , but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation, which would involve (inter-alia) searching japanese language websites in a focussed way.

So do your research wukifnee, contact others, try and build a case and if/ when you feel you have one, apply your information wisely. I wish you good luck.

That was my point. If you are going to post web links, using a relatively new account I might add, to enlighten us, then have the common decency to back up what you post.

Surely Reddit is not the ideal place to conduct investigations, but it serves little purpose to imply one thing whilst attempting to maintain a middle position. Meaning, if you are simply attempting to repeat FUD, when these issues have already been noted in other threads, then bring something new to the table. Else, people like me will call you out.

Does that make any sense? I'm not certain if I can elaborate further, but let me try.

To bring to the attention of the Reddit Community -- to imply -- that Cardona is, could be, may be (etc.) murky, is what? It's an attempt to smear. Own up to what you are doing.

They’ll ask to use the platform for their own currency. That doesn’t mean ADA won’t have a value of its own on the side. But don’t expect it to become the de facto nor de jure currency of say Japan.

So we have to value Cardano in two ways. One is the platform, which I think will be great and used by organizations. The other thing is the currency currency implemented (ADA).

,godmanjp,,,,"The ADA coins amount to 45,000,000,000, which is enormous.
It is enough to be convinced when considering the vision and scale of the Cardano project.
In order for this project to be successful in the future, it should be preceded by creating an environment in which the ADA coin can be used and allowing it to be retained by many people.
In this sense, the following management strategies are needed.

1. You need to strengthen your marketing skills so that even one person can know the existence of Cardano and ADA to many people.

2. You have to worry about what kind of incentives will be given to the holder who loves Cardano and strives for marketing with affection.

3. Build a network with a variety of app developers who are launching on the Cardano platform.

4. It is necessary to diversify the ADA exchange channel.

I hope Caradano project have a great success.

日本語
ADAコインは45,000,000,000個、その発行量が非常に多い。
カルダーノプロジェクトのビジョンと規模を考えると、十分に納得がいくほど量とすることができる。
今後、このプロジェクトが成功するためにはADAコインが使用ドゥェオジルできる環境を造成するとともに、多くの人々に保持することができるようにすることが先行しなければならない。
そのような意味では、次のような経営戦略が必要であろう見る。
1.一人でも多くの人にカルダーノとADAの存在を知っているようにマーケティング力を強化しなければならない。
2.カルダーノを愛し、愛情を持って、マーケティングに努力する者にどのようなインセンティブを与えるのかを考えなければならない。
3.カルダーノプラットフォームにローンチされる複数のアプリケーションの開発者とのネットワークを構築しなければならない。
4. ADA所チャンネルを多様化する必要がある。

한국어
ADA코인은 45,000,000,000개로 그 발행량이 엄청나게 많다.
카르다노 프로젝트의 비전과 규모를 생각할 때 충분히 납득이 갈 만한 량이라고 할 수 있다.
향후, 이 프로젝트가 성공하기 위해서는 ADA코인이 사용되어질 수 있는 환경을 조성함과 동시에 많은 사람들에게 보유될 수 있도록 하는 것이 선행되어야 한다. 그런 의미에서 다음과 같은 경영전략이 필요하리라 본다.
1. 한 사람이라도 많은 사람에게 카르다노와 ADA의 존재를 알 수 있도록 마케팅력을 강화해야 한다.
2. 카르다노를 사랑하고 애정을 가지고 마케팅에 노력하는 보유자에게 어떠한 인센티브를 줄 것인가를 고민해야 한다.
3. 카르다노 플랫폼에 론칭되는 여러 어플개발자와의 네트워크를 구축해 가야 한다.
4. ADA 거래소 채널을 다양화할 필요가 있다.

,[deleted],,,,"Hey there BTCLOGO....  

First and foremost I kindly request that you google IOHK and visit their website, this is the company that is developing Cardano along with various other extremely well reputed establishments which you would be able to gain further insight into if you do further investigations via the internet from the resources at hand.

Now visit Youtube, search Cardano and take the time to do an in depth assessment of all posts from various parties involved in the project, as well as independent reviews from various different Youtuber's.

Now visit all the reviews and news posts from various different websites which are really easy to find if you do the neccesary search via your favourite search engine.

If you are able to take the time to go through all the information at hand, which I propose all investors do prior to making an investment of any kind, you will come to see just who you are dealing with and the scope for huge progress in many different regards relating to the Cardano project and the ADA coin.

I could go on and on promoting Cardano and for so many different reasons, however the fact of the matter is that everyone has to do their own investigations and come up with their own conclusion, and on that note my personal conclusion is as follows:

1.  These guys are 100% transparent and professional and this is made very clear through the Cardano website in the form of audit and regular progress reports which are made available to the public.
2.  The Cardano team and associates involved with the development of the product extend cross border, within the region of 6 different countries having individuals involved and their collective intelligence as a team is in my opinion beyond astounding.
3.  Key players in the Cardano team have loads of experience in the crypto currency environment from their past endeavours and they know exactly what needs to be done in order to take the game to the next level and on a macro global level and most importantly, just how to do it.
4.  The Cardano roadmap is clear and they know exactly where they're going and what needs to be done in order to achieve their objectives and this information is available for all to see.
5.  If these guys say they have technology that is revoutionary and they're in the process of rolling it out, you need to know that it is very real and you can have peace of mind in this regard.
6.  There are so many crypto coins out there, so many lies, so many promises so much hot air, so many scams, sooo much deceit and I am of the certain belief that in the most positive of ways, Cardano stands way out from 85% of the market, based on credentials and the level of credibility that the key players, developers and the rest of their team have earned thus far.

The world needs to come to Cardano, the world needs to embrace the sound ethics of Cardano, the world will come to see the strength of this amazing endeavour and I strongly urge all to partake in this awesome opportunity.   ADA is here and it's the future of crypto, mark my words.  You can be a fly on the wall or you can reach for the sky... Cardano is going to take us there and if you snooze, you loose ;)

1) Download the Daedalus wallet from daedaluswallet.io, install the wallet and make sure you can open it and let it sync to the blockchain. This will take maybe an hour(synching blocks, and if you tried to do this a few months later, it would take more time, depending how much blockchain had been created). The Daedalus wallet is the official wallet of Cardano to store your Ada.
2) Reset your computer and open your wallet to make sure it opens.
3) Buy Bitcoin.
4) go to coinswitch.io and follow the prompts, it is straight forward. When you visit coinswitch.io, you want to convert your bitcoin to Ada. You do it this way, because the only way to buy Ada at the moment is to buy bitcoin using your fiat currency, and then use bittrex.com or coinswitch.io to convert your bitcoin to Ada. Coinswitch is easier to use than bittrex.

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem.

Sorry dude not sorry.

For once this community needs to grasp reality. A lot of users are maybe impatient but their impatience is reasonable. For a coin with a caliber of ADA they are expecting a more eleborative roadmap that talks about the important projects like introducing the mobile wallet, ADA card and plans on when to diversify the market listings, not a geek's chart that introduces another 30 day countdown clock after making the users wait for some good 30 days.

,RayMetz100,,,,"Look at the top 5 stocks as an example.  What were the top 5 stocks 5 years ago?  Notice how all 5 went up together.  Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.  You will miss all the new coins and find your old #70-100 collection became an average of #120.

And just what are these counter claims, specifically? 

That Cardano was developed elsewhere on a certain date? 

That Cardano was copied/forked from Cardano Labo? 

That Cardano was developed as a gaming platform initially? 

You are going to have to be specific here. And here's how you can word it, in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters.

Begin with: ""On January X, 201X, John Doe, of Cardona Labo, created a gaming platform for these reasons and etc.,"" Write logical sentences, building your case as you go, without emotional accusations that carry zero weight in the land of reasonable people, and come to some clear conclusion. 

Add references to evidence that support your specific, identifiable and reasonable conclusions. 

Example: (Here is the evidence.) 

Exhibit A: Affidavit from CEO John Doe attesting that he originally financed the development of Cardano Labo, before Cardano existed. 

Exhibit B: YouTube video certified as original (unedited) of CFO Sam Doe, Cardano Labo, dated January X, 2016, indicating he actually created Cardano Labo in China at XYZ Labs three years before Hoshkinson did;  

Exhibit C: A Cardano Labo Github pull request from ""ethereumcharles"" showing that on February X, 201X, Cardano was forked from Cardano Labo.

- There are a _lot_ of virtual machines being built by various crypto projects (Neo has its own VM, Ethereum has its own VM, etc etc), all of which share underlying common goals but may differ in the instruction set, semantics of the VM and so forth. Do you see this landscape consolidating somewhat in the future into some more robust, common virtual machines? And is IELE meant to be specific to Cardano, or do you see it as a thing of its own that can then potentially be used by others outside of Cardano?

- The article says that Runtime Verification is looking to build an improved backend to K that is an order of magnitude faster. Are there any benchmarks for the existing execution speed of K-compiled binaries compared to non-K-compiled binaries?

,hydrozappa,,,,"Cardano is a project that began in 2015 as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed.
“The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration.”
Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed.
“Our large team of expert engineers and researchers drawn from around the world started by deconstructing the concept of a cryptocurrency. Then, incorporating our groundbreaking Proof of Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, the IOHK team employed a first principles approach driven by peer reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.”
Cardano is the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet, a product that brings together such disciplines as distributed systems, mechanism design and cryptography.
Cardano’s multi layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run next-generation smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.
As a whole, the protocol’s design is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators.
“We have designed a system that can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and are installing a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.”
In the spirit of many open source projects, Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. Rather, it embraced a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. These include the following:
Separation of accounting and computation into different layers
Implementation of core components in highly modular functional code
Small groups of academics and developers competing with peer reviewed research
Heavy use of interdisciplinary teams including early use of InfoSec experts
Fast iteration between white papers, implementation and new research required to correct issues discovered during review
Building in the ability to upgrade post-deployed systems without destroying the network
Development of a decentralized funding mechanism for future work
A long-term view on improving the design of cryptocurrencies so they can work on mobile devices with a reasonable and secure user experience
Bringing stakeholders closer to the operations and maintenance of their cryptocurrency
Acknowledging the need to account for multiple assets in the same ledger
Abstracting transactions to include optional metadata in order to better conform to the needs of legacy systems
Learning from the nearly 1,000 altcoins by embracing features that make sense
Adopt a standards-driven process inspired by the Internet Engineering Task Force using a dedicated foundation to lock down the final protocol design
Explore the social elements of commerce
Find a healthy middle ground for regulators to interact with commerce without compromising some core principles inherited from Bitcoin
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.
Cardano is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.
The Cardano development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.
Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion.
Cardano is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language.
The aggregation of our principled exploration of the cryptocurrency space is two collections of protocols:
A provably secure proof of stake based cryptocurrency called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.
You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws.
Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason: It is the first component of the Cardano Platform.
CSL’s consensus algorithm is controlled by a diverse and increasingly more decentralized set of actors or their delegated assigns.
While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.
The value ledger is called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). As the purpose is to account for value, the roadmap has the following goals:
Support two sets of scripting languages, one to move value and another to enhance overlay protocol support
Provide support for KMZ sidechains to link to other ledgers
Support multiple types of signature including quantum resistant signatures for higher security
Support multiple user issued assets
Achieve true scalability, meaning as more users join, the capabilities of the system increase
A set of protocols called the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL).
With CCL, it is possible to create a special purpose token held by delegates of that ledger who could be regulated entities, thereby creating a permissioned ledger.
The flexibility of this approach allows for different instances of CCL to materialize with different rules about the evaluation of transactions. For example, gambling activities could be restricted unless KYC/AML data is present simply by blacklisting non-attributed transactions.
“Our design emphasis is to accommodate the social aspects of cryptocurrencies, build in layers by separating the accounting of value from complex computation, and address the needs of regulators within the scope of several immutable principles.”
Cardano modularity allows for features such as delegation, sidechains, sub-scribable checkpoints, better data structures for light clients, different forms of random number generation and even different synchronization assumptions. As a network develops from having thousands to millions and even billions of users, the requirements of its consensus algorithm will also change. Thus, it is vital to have enough flexibility to accommodate these changes and thereby future-proof the heart of a cryptocurrency.
“We argue that users of a protocol need incentives to understand the social contract behind their protocol and have the freedom to propose changes in a productive way. This freedom extends to every aspect of a value exchange system, from deciding how markets should be regulated to which projects should be funded. Yet it cannot be brokered through centralized actors nor require some special credential that could be co-opted by a well funded minority.”
“Our hope is that Cardano will eventually include a formal, blockchain based system to propose and vote on both soft and hard forks. Bitcoin with its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO fork, and many other cryptocurrencies besides have endured long standing and, in frequent cases, unresolved arguments over the technical and moral direction of the codebase.”
Cardano is a financial system that accepts its social nature.
Cardano’s design borrows from TCP/IP the concept of separation of concerns. In other words, separation of value from computation. This separation does not mean that Cardano will not support smart contracts. On the contrary, by making the separation explicit, it permits significantly more flexibility in the design, use, privacy and execution of smart contracts.
With respect to sidechains, Cardano will support a new protocol developed by Kiayias, Miller and Zindros (KMZ sidechains) based upon prior results from proofs of proofs of work.
The concept allows for the secure and non-interactive movement of funds from CSL to any Cardano Computation Layer or other blockchain supporting the protocol.
KMZ sidechains are the key to encapsulating complexity.
“For Cardano, we decided to start with using elliptic curve cryptography, the Ed25519 curve in particular. We also decided to enhance the existing libraries by adding support for HD wallets using Dr Dmitry Khovratovich and Jason Law’s Specification.”
“We are interested in integrating BLISS-B to add quantum computer resistant signatures to our system. We are also interested in adding SECP256k1 to enhance interoperability with legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.”
“Cardano has been designed with special extensions that will allow us to add more signature schemes through a soft fork.”
Cardano has adopted a pragmatic approach to multi-asset accounting. Building in stages, the first challenge is designing the necessary infrastructure to support the demands of thousands of UIAs. Namely the following advancements are necessary:
Special purpose authenticated data structures to permit the tracking of a very large UTXO state.
The ability to have a distributed mempool to hold a huge set of pending transactions.
Blockchain partitioning and checkpoints to permit a huge global blockchain.
An incentive scheme that rewards consensus nodes for including different sets of transactions.
A subscription mechanic that allows users to decide which currencies they want to track.

I saw mentions about Cardano Labo in Slack, so I will explain here about Cardano Labs (or Labo).

Cardano Labo was originally a project started by Japanese businessmen who knew of the project early on and were big fans of the Cardano vision. They wanted to build a blockchain solution on Cardano when the computation layer was completed, however due to delays in development, Cardano Labo decided to proceed with other protocols and change its corporate name to Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore the possibilities of developing applications with multiple platforms, then eventually became a major player in the Vietnamese blockchain community.
There is no commercial or capital affiliation between Cardano Labo and any of the Cardano project entities to this date.
With the Cardano Computation Layer drawing near, Emurgo has been in contact with Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore possibilities of collaboration to develop DApps and smart contracts on Cardano. We are excited about the possibility to work with Infinity Blockchain Labs as they have established a strong presence and reputation in the Vietnamese blockchain and fintech industries.

My gut knows without any doubt that we are going to be positively surprised in terms of the progress that ADA will make regarding value.  There is alot of work that needs to be done and surely IOHK and company know that it's not only about what tech they can develop.  Networking, and forging forward in strong partnerships with the right establishments, is going to help set the ADA ball rolling big time. The Cardano team are by no means a clown operation, they do have serious plans and whoever doesn't come to the Cardano party, buy and hold ADA, will be kicking themselves in time to come.  They're going to succeed, we all need to exercise patience and trust in their process. Mark my words 2021/2022, 1 x ADA will amount to in the region of $300.00 if not more.

I must say at the outset:
1) I have enjoyed watching and listening to Charles Hoskinson over the past couple of years (youTube and so on) - impressive, persuasive.
2) I hold no ADA, so have no skin in the game. However, I hold a few ETCs, so I have some interest.

I have little doubt that Charles was involved with ""Cardano Gaming Group"" (see icedbeverage comment elsewhere, or follow directly here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZqIeZQXHk published by Attain Corporation, 21 Dec 2015).
I commend icedbeverage for his comment: ""This is not fud these are valid concerns. [This video has] ... Hoskinson in them and they talk about a gaming platform. We need to know the full history and if there was anything sketchy or fraudulent.""

By some accounts at the time (about July/ August 2016), CARDANO ADA coin from Cardano Gaming Group somehow failed to deliver and left many Japanese who had invested in it disgruntled (see note 1 below). 

Wukifnee: if you are one of the (allegedly) disgruntled investors, I sympathize.
 
To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.

By the way, there is a company ""CGG Limited"" registered in the Isle of Man, previously named ""Cardano Gaming Group Limited"" and previous to that ""Cardano Limited"" - documents available for download for a modest fee at https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=331585

The Isle of Man info above may be a red herring, however on the face of it, it may be worth looking into, if you're so inclined/ motivated.

I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular , but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation, which would involve (inter-alia) searching japanese language websites in a focussed way.

So do your research wukifnee, contact others, try and build a case and if/ when you feel you have one, apply your information wisely. I wish you good luck.

,hydrozappa,,,,"Cardano is a project that began in 2015 as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed.
“The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration.”
Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed.
“Our large team of expert engineers and researchers drawn from around the world started by deconstructing the concept of a cryptocurrency. Then, incorporating our groundbreaking Proof of Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, the IOHK team employed a first principles approach driven by peer reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.”
Cardano is the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet, a product that brings together such disciplines as distributed systems, mechanism design and cryptography.
Cardano’s multi layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run next-generation smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.
As a whole, the protocol’s design is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators.
“We have designed a system that can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and are installing a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.”
In the spirit of many open source projects, Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. Rather, it embraced a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. These include the following:
Separation of accounting and computation into different layers
Implementation of core components in highly modular functional code
Small groups of academics and developers competing with peer reviewed research
Heavy use of interdisciplinary teams including early use of InfoSec experts
Fast iteration between white papers, implementation and new research required to correct issues discovered during review
Building in the ability to upgrade post-deployed systems without destroying the network
Development of a decentralized funding mechanism for future work
A long-term view on improving the design of cryptocurrencies so they can work on mobile devices with a reasonable and secure user experience
Bringing stakeholders closer to the operations and maintenance of their cryptocurrency
Acknowledging the need to account for multiple assets in the same ledger
Abstracting transactions to include optional metadata in order to better conform to the needs of legacy systems
Learning from the nearly 1,000 altcoins by embracing features that make sense
Adopt a standards-driven process inspired by the Internet Engineering Task Force using a dedicated foundation to lock down the final protocol design
Explore the social elements of commerce
Find a healthy middle ground for regulators to interact with commerce without compromising some core principles inherited from Bitcoin
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.
Cardano is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.
The Cardano development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.
Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion.
Cardano is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language.
The aggregation of our principled exploration of the cryptocurrency space is two collections of protocols:
A provably secure proof of stake based cryptocurrency called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.
You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws.
Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason: It is the first component of the Cardano Platform.
CSL’s consensus algorithm is controlled by a diverse and increasingly more decentralized set of actors or their delegated assigns.
While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.
The value ledger is called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). As the purpose is to account for value, the roadmap has the following goals:
Support two sets of scripting languages, one to move value and another to enhance overlay protocol support
Provide support for KMZ sidechains to link to other ledgers
Support multiple types of signature including quantum resistant signatures for higher security
Support multiple user issued assets
Achieve true scalability, meaning as more users join, the capabilities of the system increase
A set of protocols called the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL).
With CCL, it is possible to create a special purpose token held by delegates of that ledger who could be regulated entities, thereby creating a permissioned ledger.
The flexibility of this approach allows for different instances of CCL to materialize with different rules about the evaluation of transactions. For example, gambling activities could be restricted unless KYC/AML data is present simply by blacklisting non-attributed transactions.
“Our design emphasis is to accommodate the social aspects of cryptocurrencies, build in layers by separating the accounting of value from complex computation, and address the needs of regulators within the scope of several immutable principles.”
Cardano modularity allows for features such as delegation, sidechains, sub-scribable checkpoints, better data structures for light clients, different forms of random number generation and even different synchronization assumptions. As a network develops from having thousands to millions and even billions of users, the requirements of its consensus algorithm will also change. Thus, it is vital to have enough flexibility to accommodate these changes and thereby future-proof the heart of a cryptocurrency.
“We argue that users of a protocol need incentives to understand the social contract behind their protocol and have the freedom to propose changes in a productive way. This freedom extends to every aspect of a value exchange system, from deciding how markets should be regulated to which projects should be funded. Yet it cannot be brokered through centralized actors nor require some special credential that could be co-opted by a well funded minority.”
“Our hope is that Cardano will eventually include a formal, blockchain based system to propose and vote on both soft and hard forks. Bitcoin with its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO fork, and many other cryptocurrencies besides have endured long standing and, in frequent cases, unresolved arguments over the technical and moral direction of the codebase.”
Cardano is a financial system that accepts its social nature.
Cardano’s design borrows from TCP/IP the concept of separation of concerns. In other words, separation of value from computation. This separation does not mean that Cardano will not support smart contracts. On the contrary, by making the separation explicit, it permits significantly more flexibility in the design, use, privacy and execution of smart contracts.
With respect to sidechains, Cardano will support a new protocol developed by Kiayias, Miller and Zindros (KMZ sidechains) based upon prior results from proofs of proofs of work.
The concept allows for the secure and non-interactive movement of funds from CSL to any Cardano Computation Layer or other blockchain supporting the protocol.
KMZ sidechains are the key to encapsulating complexity.
“For Cardano, we decided to start with using elliptic curve cryptography, the Ed25519 curve in particular. We also decided to enhance the existing libraries by adding support for HD wallets using Dr Dmitry Khovratovich and Jason Law’s Specification.”
“We are interested in integrating BLISS-B to add quantum computer resistant signatures to our system. We are also interested in adding SECP256k1 to enhance interoperability with legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.”
“Cardano has been designed with special extensions that will allow us to add more signature schemes through a soft fork.”
Cardano has adopted a pragmatic approach to multi-asset accounting. Building in stages, the first challenge is designing the necessary infrastructure to support the demands of thousands of UIAs. Namely the following advancements are necessary:
Special purpose authenticated data structures to permit the tracking of a very large UTXO state.
The ability to have a distributed mempool to hold a huge set of pending transactions.
Blockchain partitioning and checkpoints to permit a huge global blockchain.
An incentive scheme that rewards consensus nodes for including different sets of transactions.
A subscription mechanic that allows users to decide which currencies they want to track.

,Sunrise2020,,,,"Hi, this is ID Sunrise2020.  First of all,  I’d like to thank you for this chance to talk about Cardano roadmap...

1.  After count down, maybe I feel that many people thought that they could find a new information or concrete contents especially about the project or future plan, for example,’ATM will be available in December’ or ‘ A University of Illinois startup founded by computer science professor Grigore Rosu, and IOHK, a leading blockchain research and development company, are partnering to design a next-generation virtual machine called IELE and a universal language framework to be used as core infrastructure for future blockchain technologies,funding from NASA, Boeing and Toyota and so on...’.   Maybe the information on roadmap may be different from what we want to get and know,,,because it 
presents mainly technical information more than the one about easy-to-understand information for common people who do not understand about cryptcurrency or blockchain...


2. When we read a newspaper, we can easily understand the main idea if we read a headlines..
Maybe there are so many information in roadmap, so many people cannot easily understand main idea...if possible, 
clear and concise text and  contents of an article is better for us...

3.  high-impact marketing technique

If more news about IELE in details is used in the roadmap, more people may think Cardano is GREAT!
Almost all common people are mainly interested in the news that makes a good impact on market..
The future project or present project,,,we need not so many information at a time..
If Headlines and short explanation on the roadmap, it is better for us because we can understand easily.

For investor and developer or researcher...people want or need different kinds of  information depending on where one stands.  We are all investors...

4. ADA price trend
We, investors, almost all are interested in price trend...if investors get good news about the project, more people trust and understand Cardano,,and if they get bad news, they worry...and finally such a news also make an influence on price trend sometimes....we keep ADA and will keep them for a long time from now on also...because Cardano project is great!  So we invest to support Cardano and ADA...if we can increase the value of Cardano and ADA, every members in Cardano are happy, I think. And the values....it’s ithe values of Cardano project and the value of ADA as assets for us, investors...

5.  marketing effectiveness is also needed for the future

Marketing development and making marketing more effective is needed  in order to make more people understand Cardano project...even if the team can have enough ability to creat wonderful project, they can hardly attract plants and firms to Cardano, or cannot attract investment in the project from company if marketing is not effective for the world..

That’s all I want to say about the roadmap...Hope next roadmap will be better for every members...

For example, My idea is next if I add the news in roadmap as a headlines...↓


A next-generation virtual machine called IELE !

✳️ funding from NASA, BOEING and Toyota and so on..

☪️ These innovations alongside Cardano’s new virtual machine – IELE – will eventually enable developers to write smart contracts in the programming language of their choice and with the tools they have come to know and love.

The system will need a broader distribution of coin holders before it is up and running in full form. So, at this early stage, even though Ouroboros is turned on, consensus is locked to private nodes until the system gathers momentum, and that may take another four to six months, said Hoskinson.

&gt;Following Byron, the next major release of Cardano, dubbed ""Shelley,"" is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2018. During the Shelley phase, the system will evolve into a full-featured, independent cryptocurrency.

Also coins on Cardano will be able to be regularity compliant more easily so the risk there is less though they will also be able to private.

,TenaciousJai,,,,"The problems that Cardano solves are those that plague the major currencies, primarily the ability to scale properly into future growth while adding on new functionality and volume in a flexible way without the requirements of forking the original chain or relying on extremely difficult consensus soft fork agreements to fix problems that are were not anticipated in the original code, but are inextricably linked to the core code causing battles over how to solve the problem that damage the value of the currency (obvious examples are BTC/BCH and ETH / ETC (which is another project of input output HK, fyi)).
Cardano resolves these problems by separating the main chain settlement layer from the computational layer, allowing the smart contracts to sit outside of the chain until the transaction is finalized and then written to the settlement layer blockchain. This prevents most of the scalability issues, because the bulk of the work is done outside of the main chain, and any updates to the computational layer can be made without breaking the original chain, including adding new coding languages, etc. Yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum are developing addon projects to do similar things, but the fact that they're addons is a symptom of the problem Cardano is attempting to solve by developing the platform from the ground up to account for the unknown knowns, and the unknown unknowns that might arise in the future.
Bitcoin and Ethereum both have massive scalability issues - bitcoin currently sits at 10-12 tx /sec capacity which is causing factions to fork the chain to solve growing pains and the development of several patches to resolve the issue including a sidechain project (lightning network) to accommodate the needs of the platform, Ethereum has similar load issues which have already forced them to develop another entire project (Raiden) to allow for growth only a couple of years into the roadmap, and it's uncertain how their Proof of Stake system will hold up when PoW ends in a few months since they're only just now releasing Metropolis. Cardano aims to start the platform integrating all of the solutions various coins have come up with into one platform, so that the usability and functionality are scalable, flexible, and predictable well into the future. Something that causes endless headaches for most other currencies that don't have a long-term vision for their development from the start, but rather rely on ad-hoc patching to fix issues as they run into problems along the way.

When people note the huge supply, they for some reason seem to think that value will be negatively affected.  This is incorrect and is most certainly not the case.  What will effect the value of the coin: 

1. Technological advancement that goes beyond the realms of the other coins.
2.  Networking and forming strategic partnerships with the right worldly establishments and perhaps even fellow competitors. 
3.  Effective promotion of the product and it's applications on a global level.
4.  Standing out from the crowd and delivering timeously in terms of the set out roadmap.

If the world comes to know and trust the product, in time it'll become extremely valuable. 

I don't for one moment think I am sucking figures out of fresh air.  If you take into consideration, the extreme volatility of the crypto market, $300.00 is 100% achievable.

In order for this project to be successful in the future, it should be preceded by creating an environment in which the ADA coin can be used and allowing it to be retained by many people.
In this sense, the following management strategies are needed.

1. You need to strengthen your marketing skills so that even one person can know the existence of Cardano and ADA to many people.

2. You have to worry about what kind of incentives will be given to the holder who loves Cardano and strives for marketing with affection.

3. Build a network with a variety of app developers who are launching on the Cardano platform.

4. It is necessary to diversify the ADA exchange channel.

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

We have to thinking in a new way of coevolution and diversity.

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

At this point, I would rather place my bets on Cardano with the kind of people Cardano has working for the project. Cardano is also not short on funds.

,FyarGyal,,,,"Things appear to be a bit murky!

I must say at the outset:
1) I have enjoyed watching and listening to Charles Hoskinson over the past couple of years (youTube and so on) - impressive, persuasive.
2) I hold no ADA, so have no skin in the game. However, I hold a few ETCs, so I have some interest.

I have little doubt that Charles was involved with ""Cardano Gaming Group"" (see icedbeverage comment elsewhere, or follow directly here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZqIeZQXHk published by Attain Corporation, 21 Dec 2015).
I commend icedbeverage for his comment: ""This is not fud these are valid concerns. [This video has] ... Hoskinson in them and they talk about a gaming platform. We need to know the full history and if there was anything sketchy or fraudulent.""

By some accounts at the time (about July/ August 2016), CARDANO ADA coin from Cardano Gaming Group somehow failed to deliver and left many Japanese who had invested in it disgruntled (see note 1 below). 

Wukifnee: if you are one of the (allegedly) disgruntled investors, I sympathize.
 
To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.

By the way, there is a company ""CGG Limited"" registered in the Isle of Man, previously named ""Cardano Gaming Group Limited"" and previous to that ""Cardano Limited"" - documents available for download for a modest fee at https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=331585

The Isle of Man info above may be a red herring, however on the face of it, it may be worth looking into, if you're so inclined/ motivated.

I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular , but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation, which would involve (inter-alia) searching japanese language websites in a focussed way.

So do your research wukifnee, contact others, try and build a case and if/ when you feel you have one, apply your information wisely. I wish you good luck.

Right now I'm a bit unsure what will happen, I don't particularly consider $10K bitcoin stable; but maybe I'm wrong about that.

Cardano shouldn't see true growth before staking and smart contracts. However, I also expect a decent chunk of ICO's to die next year, and for regulation to increase. That works in favor of Cardano (and other legitimate, well-thought-out blockchain projects), so it's hard to say how the landscape will look by then.

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

Cardano is a living organism now. Can’t wait for Shelley to replace Byron, and we go from there. Somewhere mid 2018 Shelley goes live yes?

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"First of all, I applaud wanting to understand both NEO and Cardano. Unfortunately, the amount of misinformation in this thread and amongst most redditers is staggering; and you're going to get the wrong read on what's actually true if you do that by reading off a laundry list of what is being touted as 'rumored features'. You are going to have to read up on what the blockchains _actually_ support now and here, what they _say_ they are going to support, and then try and assess whether you think its likely they will succeed. And that can be very hard to do, because it sometimes involves digging into code, or knowing enough math to closely read the whitepapers and identify when vague bullshit statements appear with no backing.

For example: Both NEO and Cardano use proof-of-stake based consensus algorithms. Both NEO and Cardano currently own all of the consensus nodes, i.e., they technically dictate the truth on the blockchain right now (centralized). The difference? NEO's consensus algorithm has changed theory multiple times, and they still haven't settled on one that will effectively protect the network against a range of attacks - that should worry you; they also have no official timeline on when they will let others run staking nodes - that should also worry you. Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is peer-reviewed, meaning at least some portion of incredibly smart cryptographers have looked over its theory and agreed that it survives scientific review - i.e., you can trust that at least the math and theory behind it seems somewhat solid; Cardano has an announced timeline, after which the 'bootstrap era' will end and other staking nodes will be able to run - 3 months from now approximately.

On the surface those two situations look similar, but there is a _huge_ difference. You will run into the same thing with the code execution you're talking about; on the surface it looks like both NEO and Cardano allow running code on the blockchain. But the approaches taken are night and day. Saying they basically 'both do this', is like saying that any two vehicles are the same because they both drive on roads - whether it's a horse cart, ferrari or a truck.

Cardano and other blockchains face a huge challenge in trying to communicate some of these things effectively, because even as an MSc in Computer Science and someone who's spending a good amount of hours looking into these things on a daily basis, it's hard for me to follow and decipher what's up and down.",True,,,,0,1507931880,,1507932305,0,dobzva2,False,t3_763rjd,t1_dobbh81,1509806465,14,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/763rjd/how_does_cardanao_compare_to_eth_neo_and_ark_etc/dobzva2/,,

,ngin-x,,,,"There are a lot of parameters to look at apart from marketcap. If marketcap was the sole criteria, you could go and invest in some 300 ranked coin. You have the potential to get 1000x in future then.

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

At this point, I would rather place my bets on Cardano with the kind of people Cardano has working for the project. Cardano is also not short on funds.

Hello and welcome to the Cardano(ADA) forum;

My name is Charlie and the purpose of running this forum is to help people understand ADA better as well as promoting this cryptocurrency.
Personally I see a great potential in this cryptocurrency and would like to gather ADA fans in this place, so that everyone of us can benefit from the information shared by other users here. Also it would be ideal if traders can come here and provide their analysis of the market. Besides Cardano's technology is unique, we can build a better future for ADA together.  Smiley

Cardano's team have their own official topics on reddit.com and other forums, but none of them have a warm and friendly environment.
The forum has got simple rules, like any other forums. Please do no spam, do not advertise and do not post any referral links here.
Please send me your valuable comments/feedback:

I fear some of the larger and popular cryptos are being pumped by the media and the tech elites and 'tech bros' of silicon valley and other money driven tech groups.  Blockchain is not meant to improve a centralized company's bottom line or quarterly profit.   

I could try to make money by following the ups and downs of the changing crypto landscape, but I can't break away from my idealist instincts.  Cardano is the only alt coin I am comfortable holding even if that means I miss out on the, ""gains"".  Personally, I'm loving the current lack of hype.  Why should we think that the very systems we are seeking to replace would be at all capable of recognizing the movements that will one day bring their undoing?  

The tech world is currently in a state of denial over how big of  a change there will be when everything is decentralized.  It's desperately trying to put a label on what is happening and laugh it off as just the next big thing that will make everyone rich.

I highly doubt it. Not a personal attack by any means, but I don't think we can blame Cardano for funding their business initially by appealing to wealthy investors (who wouldn't???), or blame the businessmen for buying in to an investment that has yielded 10x returns so far (again, who wouldn't???). 

Making money is almost always at someone else's expense. It often takes money to make money. I can't cry sour grapes just because someone else had the capital to buy in at an early stage than I am qualified for. I'll buy in when I can, and be grateful for the opportunity - but that's just me.

,parakmiakos_trader,,,,"Very nice example of how growth works. Just to add to what I was saying before in regards to growth. Potential adopters of Cardano and people in general that do not understand how growth as you explained it works, see the price of the coin being about 3 cents now and they calculate quickly the market cap required for the coin to reach ethereum's price of $300 and work out that the market cap would have to be huge to reach to that price per ADA. What they don't take into consideration is the percentage growth of the coin it self and factor that percentage into their investment to work out their potential profits ie

I will spend $1000 to buy some ADA now ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 33,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs 30 cents = (33,333 coins X $0.3 per coin = $9,999) 
I made a profit of $9,999 - $1000 initial investment = $8,999



Now let's go to Ethereum

I will spend $1000 to buy some ETH now ($1000 at $300 per coin = roughly 3.33 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $3000 = (3.33 coins X $3000 per coin = $9,990)
I made a profit of $9,990 - $1000 initial investment = $ 8,990

Notice how 1 ADA had to go from 0.03 cents to 0.3 cents and 1 ETH had to go from $300 to $3000 TO MAKE THE SAME profit roughly. The growth of both coins was 10 times up.





Now let's start with both coins from let's say $0.03 with an initial investment of $1000

I will spend $1000 to buy ADA ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ADA coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $9.3337451e+12. This is not going to happen anytime soon. So IMHO, people should not expect to see 1 ADA costing $300. Which is what Ethereum costs today. The Ethereum boat has sailed. Unless if you want to speculate on the hundreds of ALTcoins out there: https://coinmarketcap.com/ .Who knows, you might get lucky.





I will spend $1000 to buy ETH ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I just made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ETH coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $28620880200. Which is roughly Ethereum's market cap today.



Ethereum tokens can cost $300 each because the total supply of ETH at the moment is 95,402,934 ETH (millions)
ADA tokens total supply is 31,112,483,745 ADA (billions). Which means a looot of people need to be invested in Cardano, for the price to go higher and higher...which means Cardano will have to go mainstream(they are just starting out). Well guess what, cryptos have been around long enough, the world is aware of them, so it might be time to go mainstream. This would require serious people with serious connections backing a blockchain project, as it is a big responsibility. Well these guys at Cardano seem to fulfill the criteria. (you need to reasearch them too, to form your own opinion).

Making profits from buying crypto coins is good, but we should be thinking about how our world will be affected by new technologies yes?


If you are a newbie trying to ride the hype, have a look at all those projects out there on  https://coinmarketcap.com. Make sure you research extensively the ones you might be interested in, and you will realize a whole heap of them are just a joke(there are solid ones too though), trying to make money. That's your money.


If you ask me what the future of the price of ADA will be in let's say the next two years, I am not sure!! I keep googling it but nothing comes up:P


Maybe the Cardano people can help us out here, and I don't believe they will, because they will be speculating which is something they can't do.

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

It is enough to be convinced when considering the vision and scale of the Cardano project.
In order for this project to be successful in the future, it should be preceded by creating an environment in which the ADA coin can be used and allowing it to be retained by many people.
In this sense, the following management strategies are needed.

1. You need to strengthen your marketing skills so that even one person can know the existence of Cardano and ADA to many people.

2. You have to worry about what kind of incentives will be given to the holder who loves Cardano and strives for marketing with affection.

3. Build a network with a variety of app developers who are launching on the Cardano platform.

4. It is necessary to diversify the ADA exchange channel.

I hope Caradano project have a great success.

2.カルダーノを愛し、愛情を持って、マーケティングに努力する者にどのようなインセンティブを与えるのかを考えなければならない。
3.カルダーノプラットフォームにローンチされる複数のアプリケーションの開発者とのネットワークを構築しなければならない。

향후, 이 프로젝트가 성공하기 위해서는 ADA코인이 사용되어질 수 있는 환경을 조성함과 동시에 많은 사람들에게 보유될 수 있도록 하는 것이 선행되어야 한다. 그런 의미에서 다음과 같은 경영전략이 필요하리라 본다.
1. 한 사람이라도 많은 사람에게 카르다노와 ADA의 존재를 알 수 있도록 마케팅력을 강화해야 한다.
2. 카르다노를 사랑하고 애정을 가지고 마케팅에 노력하는 보유자에게 어떠한 인센티브를 줄 것인가를 고민해야 한다.
3. 카르다노 플랫폼에 론칭되는 여러 어플개발자와의 네트워크를 구축해 가야 한다.
4. ADA 거래소 채널을 다양화할 필요가 있다.

Support for decentralized market making to improve liquidity between UIA and the primary token.
“Our preliminary efforts for finding the right authenticated data structure have resulted in a new type of AVL+ Tree jointly developed by Leo Reyzin, IOHK and Waves. More research is required, but it is a foundational advancement that will be included in a later version of Cardano.”
“We expect — subject to research results — to include a protocol into Cardano for UIAs during the Basho of CSL release in 2018.”
“Our scalability goals for Cardano are greatly aided by our consensus algorithm.”
OUROBOROS
IOHK scientists led byProf. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros.
“Our proof of stake protocol is called Ouroboros and it has been designed by an extremely talented team of cryptographers from five academic institutions led by Professor Aggelos Kiayias of the University of Edinburgh. The core innovation it brings beyond being proven secure using a rigorous cryptographic model is a modular and flexible design that allows for the composition of many protocols to enhance functionality.”
Ouroboros permits a decentralized way to elect a quorum of consensus nodes, which in turn can run more traditional protocols developed over the last 20 years to accommodate the needs of large infrastructure providers such as Google and Facebook.
Ouroboros determines how individual nodes reach consensus about the network.
Ouroboros eliminates the need for an energy-hungry proof of work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for much wider use.
Ouroboros is the first proof of stake protocol that scientifically has been shown to be provably secure.
In terms of consensus, Ouroboros was designed in a sufficiently modular fashion to support smart contract evaluation.
“In our current roadmap, scaling methods will be applied to Ouroboros starting in 2018 and continue to be a focus in 2019 and 2020.”
Both CSL and CCL will share the same consensus algorithm. The difference is that Ouroboros can be confirmed to permit both permissioned and permissionless ledgers via token distribution.
The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has.
Cardano’s HSM strategy will be to attempt implemented specialized protocols over the next two years using Intel SGX and ARM Trustzone.
Both modules are built into billions of consumer devices from laptops to cellphones and require no additional effort on the consumer side to use.
Both are also heavily vetted, well designed and based upon years of iteration from some of the largest and best funded hardware security teams.
The use of HSMs to provide an identity space where PII is not leaked but yet used to authenticate and credential actors should provide a global reputation system and allow for much lower cost regulated activities to be conducted, such as online gaming with automated tax compliance or decentralized exchanges.
The Cardano ecosystem is developing out into the most complete and most useful cryptocurrency ever constructed.
DAEDALUS
To use Ada you must download the Daedalus digital wallet. Daedalus is a secure, HD wallet for the Ada cryptocurrency.
Daedalus wallet has many special features, which make it easy to use and give you a high degree of confidence about its security. These include:
Encrypted private keys and spending passwords, offering protection against security threats such as malware.
Wallets can be exported to paper certificates, giving the maximum security option of placing funds in cold storage.
Ada redemption is built directly into Daedalus and supports encrypted and unencrypted redemption certificates.
Configurable transaction assurance level monitoring, allowing users to be sure when transactions become irreversible.
Future releases of Daedalus will allow third party developers to build innovative applications directly for the wallet. Whether you would like micro credit, to set up recurring payments, or to exchange cryptocurrencies, it will be easy to customize your Daedalus experience.
Daedalus is built on top of Electron, a battle-proven open source development platform to build cross-platform desktop apps using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
You don’t have to be a specialist in cryptography and security to build amazing plugins for Daedalus. “We provide you with rich and secure APIs to interact with cryptocurrency backends.”
The core features of Daedalus are just the beginning. “Our goal is to give anyone the power to extend Daedalus with custom plugins, automation and literally any innovation you can come up with.”
“To keep the experience consistent for Daedalus users and simplify your development workflow, we have developed a small but flexible React UI framework that you can use to build beautiful plugins that just merge into the whole platform.”
You will be able to easily adjust the current color theme for all components in the Daedalus Design Language. The best thing about this: “Developers just have to follow our guidelines to use the component framework to make this work.”
“Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on or substantive review of any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.”
“Stake” gives a user the power to control various Cardano SL algorithm parts, for example: being the slot leader, voting in the Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC. This is why all thresholds in Cardano SL protocol are expressed in terms of stake, not balance.
“When we are talking about the ‘stake’, we are talking about a user’s ability to control Cardano SL.”
IOHK will maintain a single official client, but there is also room for third-party alternative clients maintained by the community.
The Bootstrap era is the period of Cardano SL existence that allows only fixed predefined users to have control over the system.
The next era after Bootstrap is called the Reward era. Reward era is actually a “normal” operation mode of Cardano SL as a PoS-cryptocurrency.
After the Bootstrap era, the Reward era will start. During this time, the network will operate in a completely decentralized, trustless mode. “We expect staking pools to emerge during this era, allowing stakeholders with little stake to get rewards as stakeholders with large stake keep their nodes online to maintain the protocol in a decentralized fashion.”
The system will receive regular software updates moving forward, and a massive amount of new features will be released in the near future.
Though Cardano SL is designed and implemented as a distributed network, for purpose of DDoS protection additional facilities were added to Cardano SL implementation and topology.
Currently all nodes are divided into 3 groups:
Core Nodes:
“We bring additional security level around this set of core nodes: we put them inside a perimeter of relay nodes, so core nodes are isolated from the public internet and only relay nodes are allowed to communicate with core nodes. This is how we reduce probability for them being attacked.”
Core nodes never create currency transactions.
Relay Nodes:
You can think of relay nodes as of proxy between core nodes and public internet.
Since relay nodes are not isolated, they can be attacked, but they are in principle stateless and do not have any stake, so they can be moved, or their number can be increased.
If relays are taken down, this does deny service, but the integrity of the core nodes (and the blockchain) should not be compromised.
Since relay nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders.
Cannot create currency transactions.
Relay nodes are fully under the control of the federated committee of initial stakeholders.
Edge Nodes:
Edge node is a simple node that anyone can run on their computer.
Only these nodes can create currency transactions.
Since edge nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders as well as relay nodes.
Edge nodes cannot directly communicate with core nodes, only with relay nodes and with other edge nodes.

However, those who were recently aware of CARDANO and ADA felt that it is very difficult to be honest, what is written when seeing the contents, and what it means. I understand that the technical content is great, but what we do with it If we do not announce what we will be able to do as a platform, we can not predict what will be possible as a platform, I thought that I do not feel much attractive.

,[deleted],,,,"Hey there, I need to respectfully contribute in clarifying that the coin supply will NOT have any effect on the price of the coin.  When people note the huge supply, they for some reason seem to think that value will be negatively affected.  This is incorrect and is most certainly not the case.  What will effect the value of the coin: 

1. Technological advancement that goes beyond the realms of the other coins.
2.  Networking and forming strategic partnerships with the right worldly establishments and perhaps even fellow competitors. 
3.  Effective promotion of the product and it's applications on a global level.
4.  Standing out from the crowd and delivering timeously in terms of the set out roadmap.

If the world comes to know and trust the product, in time it'll become extremely valuable.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

,demetrius2012,,,,"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The roadmap provided alot of what people expected, and few surprises - this is fine from my point of view. There are a few areas I would consider working on moving forward: 

1. Make interviews/videos shorter. There are too many 45 minute videos explaining exactly the same thing about ADA (and frankly, with too much fluff on 3rd gen blockchain and not enough emphasis on quick comparisons of how ADA shakes up the market). Give people 5 minute clips and make this feel accessible. For instance, if you release a roadmap and have a month where no software is being released and just a countdown clock is running, I would think you could take each of the key sections of that section of the roadmap and build out a small series of 5 minute videos explaining why each component matters, and emphasize why each release must occur in that specific order for ADA to succeed. The team is doing advanced stuff and the general public simply doesn't understand all of it - make the value proposition more tangible (i.e. sure, we could release smart contracts tomorrow, but that would lead to x,y,z so it must be done like this). Shorter videos allow systematic deconstruction of invalid points and time to assess where value creation is occurring - for Cardano, alot of that value creation is in the way it is being developed and this is super intangible to ""normal people"" despite its importance. 

2. If you don't find a way of building off the roadmap each month through video explanations of each section, or weekly questions on each portion of the roadmap, then I honestly think you should drop the countdown clock. It doesn't mean anything other than hype and I am not a fan of coins with verbal hype and no releases to back it up. A website with no release dates and generic time frames that are 6 months out aren't too helpful with a coin this new. I think guaranteed quarterly or 6 month software releases would be more meaningful. 

3. If you keep up the the roadmaps, release more information. A roadmap changes, sure. But inviting the community to comment on something where we don't even actually know where you are headed, makes it difficult to provide feedback. Every decision has a ripple effect. We are looking at a small snapshot of the ADA vision, so how can we say whether or not this first section of the roadmap is appropriate or not since we don't know how it is meant to plug in to the future releases? I think a minimum of a 1 year vision should be in a roadmap so the community can actually see where things are going and provide real feedback on priorities. 

4. Keep up the community engagement. It has been great to have so many members of the IOHK team available to answer questions on here and to engage the community.

Ultimately it's difficult to adapt blockchains to make them fit for specific applications or use cases.

They are not competing projects per se, as Cardano has a completely different architecture, with the world's first provably secure PoS algorithm Ouroboros driving it. IOHK is contracted to work on Cardano till at least 2020 and may well be working on Cardano much longer.

The projects are not in direct competition, and Cardano benefits from the expertise learnt by IOHK in their work on ETC.

,tsuru22neo,,,,"Ouroboros, developed by a team led by IOHK chief scientist Aggelos Kiayias, made it through a tough admission process for the prestigious conference. This year, 311 papers were submitted and of those 72 were accepted. Only three papers at the conference were on the subject of blockchain. All three papers were supported by IOHK funding.

Speaking after his presentation, Professor Kiayias said: “We’re very happy that we had the opportunity to present Ouroboros at the conference. The protocol and especially its security analysis were very well received by fellow cryptographers.”

“Our next steps will be to focus on the next version of the protocol, Ouroboros Praos which improves even further the security and performance characteristics of the protocol.”

The Ouroboros protocol stands out as the first proof of stake algorithm that is provably secure, meaning that it offers security guarantees that are mathematically proven. This is essential for a protocol that is intended to be used in cryptocurrency, an infrastructure that must be relied on to carry billions of dollars worth of value. In addition to security, if blockchains are going to become infrastructure for new financial systems they must be able to comfortably handle millions of users. The key to scaling up is proof of stake, a far more energy efficient and cost effective algorithm, and as such this research represents a significant step forward in cryptography.

,zimmah,,,,"www.neo.org is the official website, although it's best to jsut skp straight to docs.neo.org(http://docs.neo.org).    
  
NEO allows many programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, Java, Javascript and python and others and uses the .NET framework, many developers are able to write smart contracts for NEO.  
    
NEO also has a token standard like ETH has ERC20, NEP5 in NEOs case. Which will encourage dApps to make use of a standardized model for tokens that can be used in the NEO wallet and make full use of their smart contract platform and be easily able to communicate with each other.     
  
While I don't know how many tx/sec Cardano can handle, NEO can handle at least 1000tx/sec which should be more than sufficient for now, but they'll improve it to 10000tx/sec.     
  
NEO also provided dividends in the form of GAS (the fuel for the NEO platform) which means that there won't be any inflation of new NEO being printed which would dilute the value of your holdings. Intitial GAS is distributed to all NEO holders until 100 million GAS is printed, and all GAS used by the network (as smart contract fees and such) is distributed among NEO holders.

,RayMetz100,,,,"Look at the top 5 stocks as an example.  What were the top 5 stocks 5 years ago?  Notice how all 5 went up together.  Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.

And just what are these counter claims, specifically? 

That Cardano was developed elsewhere on a certain date? 

That Cardano was copied/forked from Cardano Labo? 

That Cardano was developed as a gaming platform initially? 

You are going to have to be specific here. And here's how you can word it, in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters.

Begin with: ""On January X, 201X, John Doe, of Cardona Labo, created a gaming platform for these reasons and etc.,"" Write logical sentences, building your case as you go, without emotional accusations that carry zero weight in the land of reasonable people, and come to some clear conclusion. 

Add references to evidence that support your specific, identifiable and reasonable conclusions. 

Example: (Here is the evidence.) 

Exhibit A: Affidavit from CEO John Doe attesting that he originally financed the development of Cardano Labo, before Cardano existed. 

Exhibit B: YouTube video certified as original (unedited) of CFO Sam Doe, Cardano Labo, dated January X, 2016, indicating he actually created Cardano Labo in China at XYZ Labs three years before Hoshkinson did;

1) Download the Daedalus wallet from daedaluswallet.io, install the wallet and make sure you can open it and let it sync to the blockchain. This will take maybe an hour(synching blocks, and if you tried to do this a few months later, it would take more time, depending how much blockchain had been created). The Daedalus wallet is the official wallet of Cardano to store your Ada.
2) Reset your computer and open your wallet to make sure it opens.
3) Buy Bitcoin.
4) go to coinswitch.io and follow the prompts, it is straight forward. When you visit coinswitch.io, you want to convert your bitcoin to Ada. You do it this way, because the only way to buy Ada at the moment is to buy bitcoin using your fiat currency, and then use bittrex.com or coinswitch.io to convert your bitcoin to Ada. Coinswitch is easier to use than bittrex.

Does that make any sense? I'm not certain if I can elaborate further, but let me try.

To bring to the attention of the Reddit Community -- to imply -- that Cardona is, could be, may be (etc.) murky, is what? It's an attempt to smear. Own up to what you are doing.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

- Built with Haskell, allowing formal verification of a lot of core aspects of the blockchain. This is important! As an example, IOHK also built a formal verification system for the Ethereum VM (KEVM), and found several errors in the EVM. Errors in the core aspects of the blockchain are bad news bears.

- IOHK are either employing or cooperating with Well Typed, one of the world's leading Haskell consultancies.

- IOHK researchers include some of the world's top minds within programming language research and algorithmic game theory. Outside of Microsoft and IBM's initiatives (and I have no idea who they enlist), I have yet to see any blockchain that has even remotely close to this level of academic research power. In practice what this means is that what they are building will come across as, and indeed probably be, a lot more trustworthy. This is work backed up by serious research and good ideas, not just good ideas.

The primary assumption going wrong in peoples mind, I find, is that existing blockchain products are 'good enough'. They're great ideas, but they are rudimentary and basic; they are the first steps. Nothing wrong with this, mind. We're going to see a LOT of evolution in this area, not just from Cardano/IOHK, but also from Hyperledger and other initiatives. 

As a programmer and academic, some of the choices Ethereum (and consequently also NEO) has made wrt. the way the scripting language and VMs work deeply puzzle me, making compile-time verification of contracts very hard, making the attack surface of the VM extremely large, and in general just making it very, very easy to make mistakes. This can and already has led to a LOT of problems, i.e., people losing a lot of money. Importantly, this weakens trust in the contract language. At the same time, academia has worked on contract languages for dozens of years now - so there's really no need to re-invent the wheel to such a degree.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"First of all, I applaud wanting to understand both NEO and Cardano. Unfortunately, the amount of misinformation in this thread and amongst most redditers is staggering; and you're going to get the wrong read on what's actually true if you do that by reading off a laundry list of what is being touted as 'rumored features'. You are going to have to read up on what the blockchains _actually_ support now and here, what they _say_ they are going to support, and then try and assess whether you think its likely they will succeed. And that can be very hard to do, because it sometimes involves digging into code, or knowing enough math to closely read the whitepapers and identify when vague bullshit statements appear with no backing.

For example: Both NEO and Cardano use proof-of-stake based consensus algorithms. Both NEO and Cardano currently own all of the consensus nodes, i.e., they technically dictate the truth on the blockchain right now (centralized). The difference? NEO's consensus algorithm has changed theory multiple times, and they still haven't settled on one that will effectively protect the network against a range of attacks - that should worry you; they also have no official timeline on when they will let others run staking nodes - that should also worry you. Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is peer-reviewed, meaning at least some portion of incredibly smart cryptographers have looked over its theory and agreed that it survives scientific review - i.e., you can trust that at least the math and theory behind it seems somewhat solid; Cardano has an announced timeline, after which the 'bootstrap era' will end and other staking nodes will be able to run - 3 months from now approximately.

On the surface those two situations look similar, but there is a _huge_ difference. You will run into the same thing with the code execution you're talking about; on the surface it looks like both NEO and Cardano allow running code on the blockchain.

,tsuru22neo,,,,"Ouroboros, developed by a team led by IOHK chief scientist Aggelos Kiayias, made it through a tough admission process for the prestigious conference. This year, 311 papers were submitted and of those 72 were accepted. Only three papers at the conference were on the subject of blockchain. All three papers were supported by IOHK funding.

Speaking after his presentation, Professor Kiayias said: “We’re very happy that we had the opportunity to present Ouroboros at the conference. The protocol and especially its security analysis were very well received by fellow cryptographers.”

“Our next steps will be to focus on the next version of the protocol, Ouroboros Praos which improves even further the security and performance characteristics of the protocol.”

The Ouroboros protocol stands out as the first proof of stake algorithm that is provably secure, meaning that it offers security guarantees that are mathematically proven. This is essential for a protocol that is intended to be used in cryptocurrency, an infrastructure that must be relied on to carry billions of dollars worth of value. In addition to security, if blockchains are going to become infrastructure for new financial systems they must be able to comfortably handle millions of users. The key to scaling up is proof of stake, a far more energy efficient and cost effective algorithm, and as such this research represents a significant step forward in cryptography.

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

At this point, I would rather place my bets on Cardano with the kind of people Cardano has working for the project. Cardano is also not short on funds.

,Sunrise2020,,,,"Hi, this is ID Sunrise2020.  First of all,  I’d like to thank you for this chance to talk about Cardano roadmap...

1.  After count down, maybe I feel that many people thought that they could find a new information or concrete contents especially about the project or future plan, for example,’ATM will be available in December’ or ‘ A University of Illinois startup founded by computer science professor Grigore Rosu, and IOHK, a leading blockchain research and development company, are partnering to design a next-generation virtual machine called IELE and a universal language framework to be used as core infrastructure for future blockchain technologies,funding from NASA, Boeing and Toyota and so on...’.   Maybe the information on roadmap may be different from what we want to get and know,,,because it 
presents mainly technical information more than the one about easy-to-understand information for common people who do not understand about cryptcurrency or blockchain...


2. When we read a newspaper, we can easily understand the main idea if we read a headlines..
Maybe there are so many information in roadmap, so many people cannot easily understand main idea...if possible, 
clear and concise text and  contents of an article is better for us...

3.  high-impact marketing technique

If more news about IELE in details is used in the roadmap, more people may think Cardano is GREAT!
Almost all common people are mainly interested in the news that makes a good impact on market..
The future project or present project,,,we need not so many information at a time..
If Headlines and short explanation on the roadmap, it is better for us because we can understand easily.

For investor and developer or researcher...people want or need different kinds of  information depending on where one stands.  We are all investors...

4. ADA price trend
We, investors, almost all are interested in price trend...if investors get good news about the project, more people trust and understand Cardano,,and if they get bad news, they worry...and finally such a news also make an influence on price trend sometimes....we keep ADA and will keep them for a long time from now on also...because Cardano project is great!  So we invest to support Cardano and ADA...if we can increase the value of Cardano and ADA, every members in Cardano are happy, I think. And the values....it’s ithe values of Cardano project and the value of ADA as assets for us, investors...

5.  marketing effectiveness is also needed for the future

Marketing development and making marketing more effective is needed  in order to make more people understand Cardano project...even if the team can have enough ability to creat wonderful project, they can hardly attract plants and firms to Cardano, or cannot attract investment in the project from company if marketing is not effective for the world..

That’s all I want to say about the roadmap...Hope next roadmap will be better for every members...

For example, My idea is next if I add the news in roadmap as a headlines...↓

Networking, and forging forward in strong partnerships with the right establishments, is going to help set the ADA ball rolling big time.

&gt; But why did you say:
&gt;&gt; some are also published in journals

/u/ethereumcharles didn't - I did. Charles is not me, and I (as I wrote) am not associated with Cardano or IOHK. I haphazardly used the concept of journal publishing as an overarching concept, that's my bad. Replace the word 'journal' with 'computer science conference' and the same thing applies similarly, as Charles has mentioned also.

To answer one of your original questions in the OP, peer review results are not published anywhere I've ever seen. If you are peer-reviewed as part of submitting a paper to a conference or journal, you usually receive feedback in the form of anonymized meta-reviewers, and that feedback is not meant to be publicized. Doing so would probably get your paper rejected instantly. The paper is revised based on the feedback (or not) and depending on need, and then either plain accepted or rejected in a follow-up round. Some conferences abide by this kind of approval process, others are simply accept/reject based on review. Peer review is not like auditing; in auditing, the result is the audit itself, which should be read. In review, the result is that either the paper is accepted (stamp of approval) or rejected. It's a filtering mechanism, whereby there is a greater probability that you can trust the work of the papers that make it through the filter.

Of course, you should still use sound scientific process and check the authors of the paper, what else they've published, read the articles and see what and who they cite, and check whether anyone else has cited the article itself yet (unlikely for new, bleeding-edge things). You should check their academic background, and what they're hired to do as researcherrs. You'll have to do all that on your own time, though, not going to do that for you :) If you did all of the above, you'd find that the papers Cardano produces are generally of a good, sound and academic quality and most other papers in the crypto space are cringeworthy for any academic to read in comparison. This bodes well for the space as a whole, and hopefully it catches on elsewhere too, so we can collectively push for higher standards. 

This isn't to say that Cardano is the _only_ place producing sound quality papers in crypto, at all. There are some very solid ones floating around that don't seem appropriate to mention here.

,demetrius2012,,,,"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The roadmap provided alot of what people expected, and few surprises - this is fine from my point of view. There are a few areas I would consider working on moving forward: 

1. Make interviews/videos shorter. There are too many 45 minute videos explaining exactly the same thing about ADA (and frankly, with too much fluff on 3rd gen blockchain and not enough emphasis on quick comparisons of how ADA shakes up the market). Give people 5 minute clips and make this feel accessible. For instance, if you release a roadmap and have a month where no software is being released and just a countdown clock is running, I would think you could take each of the key sections of that section of the roadmap and build out a small series of 5 minute videos explaining why each component matters, and emphasize why each release must occur in that specific order for ADA to succeed. The team is doing advanced stuff and the general public simply doesn't understand all of it - make the value proposition more tangible (i.e. sure, we could release smart contracts tomorrow, but that would lead to x,y,z so it must be done like this). Shorter videos allow systematic deconstruction of invalid points and time to assess where value creation is occurring - for Cardano, alot of that value creation is in the way it is being developed and this is super intangible to ""normal people"" despite its importance. 

2. If you don't find a way of building off the roadmap each month through video explanations of each section, or weekly questions on each portion of the roadmap, then I honestly think you should drop the countdown clock. It doesn't mean anything other than hype and I am not a fan of coins with verbal hype and no releases to back it up. A website with no release dates and generic time frames that are 6 months out aren't too helpful with a coin this new. I think guaranteed quarterly or 6 month software releases would be more meaningful. 

3. If you keep up the the roadmaps, release more information. A roadmap changes, sure. But inviting the community to comment on something where we don't even actually know where you are headed, makes it difficult to provide feedback. Every decision has a ripple effect. We are looking at a small snapshot of the ADA vision, so how can we say whether or not this first section of the roadmap is appropriate or not since we don't know how it is meant to plug in to the future releases? I think a minimum of a 1 year vision should be in a roadmap so the community can actually see where things are going and provide real feedback on priorities. 

4. Keep up the community engagement. It has been great to have so many members of the IOHK team available to answer questions on here and to engage the community.

- IOHK are either employing or cooperating with Well Typed, one of the world's leading Haskell consultancies.

- IOHK researchers include some of the world's top minds within programming language research and algorithmic game theory. Outside of Microsoft and IBM's initiatives (and I have no idea who they enlist), I have yet to see any blockchain that has even remotely close to this level of academic research power.

The primary assumption going wrong in peoples mind, I find, is that existing blockchain products are 'good enough'. They're great ideas, but they are rudimentary and basic; they are the first steps.

As a programmer and academic, some of the choices Ethereum (and consequently also NEO) has made wrt. the way the scripting language and VMs work deeply puzzle me, making compile-time verification of contracts very hard, making the attack surface of the VM extremely large, and in general just making it very, very easy to make mistakes. This can and already has led to a LOT of problems, i.e., people losing a lot of money. Importantly, this weakens trust in the contract language.

The layer that holds ADA has been live for a little while now and the Cardano people are working hard to keep up with minor bugs and software development, as well as all the other things a block chain dev and research team  deals with.

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

    We've tracked this long enough now to project the value of the 
    asset overall in 3-stages. Market cap ranges of $650mm in stage 
    1, $4billion in stage 2, and closer to $42-44billion for stage 3 
    (2019-2020). ADA is no joke, but it's structured to end up 
    topping out at about $1.00USD total in value for the ADA asset, 
    from what we can see. This will allow an ADA to compete with 
    the global economic space (FIAT side) a lot easier than someone 
    looking at a BTC for $5,000 -$7500 down the road.
    Something to think about.

Ultimately it's difficult to adapt blockchains to make them fit for specific applications or use cases. That's why Cardano was designed and built from scratch in Haskell code to be a highly secure blockchain. It allows formal verification of code, and easy extensibility through a layered architecture.

The vast majority of IOHK (engineering company co-founded by Charles) resources are devoted towards developing Cardano, but they also work on ETC. They are not competing projects per se, as Cardano has a completely different architecture, with the world's first provably secure PoS algorithm Ouroboros driving it. IOHK is contracted to work on Cardano till at least 2020 and may well be working on Cardano much longer.

The projects are not in direct competition, and Cardano benefits from the expertise learnt by IOHK in their work on ETC. In addition, Cardano's ability to operate effectively in regulated applications and industries will also separate it from those use cases which ETC might be used in.",True,,,,0,1507259409,,False,0,dnz5elo,False,t3_74kwl6,t3_74kwl6,1509351244,9,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/74kwl6/ada_and_etc/dnz5elo/,,

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

,demetrius2012,,,,"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The roadmap provided alot of what people expected, and few surprises - this is fine from my point of view. There are a few areas I would consider working on moving forward: 

1. Make interviews/videos shorter. There are too many 45 minute videos explaining exactly the same thing about ADA (and frankly, with too much fluff on 3rd gen blockchain and not enough emphasis on quick comparisons of how ADA shakes up the market). Give people 5 minute clips and make this feel accessible. For instance, if you release a roadmap and have a month where no software is being released and just a countdown clock is running, I would think you could take each of the key sections of that section of the roadmap and build out a small series of 5 minute videos explaining why each component matters, and emphasize why each release must occur in that specific order for ADA to succeed. The team is doing advanced stuff and the general public simply doesn't understand all of it - make the value proposition more tangible (i.e. sure, we could release smart contracts tomorrow, but that would lead to x,y,z so it must be done like this). Shorter videos allow systematic deconstruction of invalid points and time to assess where value creation is occurring - for Cardano, alot of that value creation is in the way it is being developed and this is super intangible to ""normal people"" despite its importance. 

2. If you don't find a way of building off the roadmap each month through video explanations of each section, or weekly questions on each portion of the roadmap, then I honestly think you should drop the countdown clock. It doesn't mean anything other than hype and I am not a fan of coins with verbal hype and no releases to back it up. A website with no release dates and generic time frames that are 6 months out aren't too helpful with a coin this new. I think guaranteed quarterly or 6 month software releases would be more meaningful. 

3. If you keep up the the roadmaps, release more information. A roadmap changes, sure. But inviting the community to comment on something where we don't even actually know where you are headed, makes it difficult to provide feedback. Every decision has a ripple effect. We are looking at a small snapshot of the ADA vision, so how can we say whether or not this first section of the roadmap is appropriate or not since we don't know how it is meant to plug in to the future releases? I think a minimum of a 1 year vision should be in a roadmap so the community can actually see where things are going and provide real feedback on priorities. 

4. Keep up the community engagement. It has been great to have so many members of the IOHK team available to answer questions on here and to engage the community.

His reaction, would be described on his own logic, at that interview, as not very wise or trustworthy...

,hydrozappa,,,,"Strong security guarantees that UIAs enjoy similar security as the native asset.
Support for decentralized market making to improve liquidity between UIA and the primary token.
“Our preliminary efforts for finding the right authenticated data structure have resulted in a new type of AVL+ Tree jointly developed by Leo Reyzin, IOHK and Waves. More research is required, but it is a foundational advancement that will be included in a later version of Cardano.”
“We expect — subject to research results — to include a protocol into Cardano for UIAs during the Basho of CSL release in 2018.”
“Our scalability goals for Cardano are greatly aided by our consensus algorithm.”
OUROBOROS
IOHK scientists led byProf. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros.
“Our proof of stake protocol is called Ouroboros and it has been designed by an extremely talented team of cryptographers from five academic institutions led by Professor Aggelos Kiayias of the University of Edinburgh. The core innovation it brings beyond being proven secure using a rigorous cryptographic model is a modular and flexible design that allows for the composition of many protocols to enhance functionality.”
Ouroboros permits a decentralized way to elect a quorum of consensus nodes, which in turn can run more traditional protocols developed over the last 20 years to accommodate the needs of large infrastructure providers such as Google and Facebook.
Ouroboros determines how individual nodes reach consensus about the network.
Ouroboros eliminates the need for an energy-hungry proof of work protocol, which stands as a barrier to blockchain scaling up for much wider use.
Ouroboros is the first proof of stake protocol that scientifically has been shown to be provably secure.
In terms of consensus, Ouroboros was designed in a sufficiently modular fashion to support smart contract evaluation.
“In our current roadmap, scaling methods will be applied to Ouroboros starting in 2018 and continue to be a focus in 2019 and 2020.”
Both CSL and CCL will share the same consensus algorithm. The difference is that Ouroboros can be confirmed to permit both permissioned and permissionless ledgers via token distribution.
The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has.
Cardano’s HSM strategy will be to attempt implemented specialized protocols over the next two years using Intel SGX and ARM Trustzone.
Both modules are built into billions of consumer devices from laptops to cellphones and require no additional effort on the consumer side to use.
Both are also heavily vetted, well designed and based upon years of iteration from some of the largest and best funded hardware security teams.
The use of HSMs to provide an identity space where PII is not leaked but yet used to authenticate and credential actors should provide a global reputation system and allow for much lower cost regulated activities to be conducted, such as online gaming with automated tax compliance or decentralized exchanges.
The Cardano ecosystem is developing out into the most complete and most useful cryptocurrency ever constructed.
DAEDALUS
To use Ada you must download the Daedalus digital wallet. Daedalus is a secure, HD wallet for the Ada cryptocurrency.
Daedalus wallet has many special features, which make it easy to use and give you a high degree of confidence about its security. These include:
Encrypted private keys and spending passwords, offering protection against security threats such as malware.
Wallets can be exported to paper certificates, giving the maximum security option of placing funds in cold storage.
Ada redemption is built directly into Daedalus and supports encrypted and unencrypted redemption certificates.
Configurable transaction assurance level monitoring, allowing users to be sure when transactions become irreversible.
Future releases of Daedalus will allow third party developers to build innovative applications directly for the wallet. Whether you would like micro credit, to set up recurring payments, or to exchange cryptocurrencies, it will be easy to customize your Daedalus experience.
Daedalus is built on top of Electron, a battle-proven open source development platform to build cross-platform desktop apps using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
You don’t have to be a specialist in cryptography and security to build amazing plugins for Daedalus. “We provide you with rich and secure APIs to interact with cryptocurrency backends.”
The core features of Daedalus are just the beginning. “Our goal is to give anyone the power to extend Daedalus with custom plugins, automation and literally any innovation you can come up with.”
“To keep the experience consistent for Daedalus users and simplify your development workflow, we have developed a small but flexible React UI framework that you can use to build beautiful plugins that just merge into the whole platform.”
You will be able to easily adjust the current color theme for all components in the Daedalus Design Language. The best thing about this: “Developers just have to follow our guidelines to use the component framework to make this work.”
“Cardano is a software platform ONLY and does not conduct any independent diligence on or substantive review of any blockchain asset, digital currency, cryptocurrency or associated funds.”
“Stake” gives a user the power to control various Cardano SL algorithm parts, for example: being the slot leader, voting in the Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC. This is why all thresholds in Cardano SL protocol are expressed in terms of stake, not balance.
“When we are talking about the ‘stake’, we are talking about a user’s ability to control Cardano SL.”
IOHK will maintain a single official client, but there is also room for third-party alternative clients maintained by the community.
The Bootstrap era is the period of Cardano SL existence that allows only fixed predefined users to have control over the system.
The next era after Bootstrap is called the Reward era. Reward era is actually a “normal” operation mode of Cardano SL as a PoS-cryptocurrency.
After the Bootstrap era, the Reward era will start. During this time, the network will operate in a completely decentralized, trustless mode. “We expect staking pools to emerge during this era, allowing stakeholders with little stake to get rewards as stakeholders with large stake keep their nodes online to maintain the protocol in a decentralized fashion.”
The system will receive regular software updates moving forward, and a massive amount of new features will be released in the near future.
Though Cardano SL is designed and implemented as a distributed network, for purpose of DDoS protection additional facilities were added to Cardano SL implementation and topology.
Currently all nodes are divided into 3 groups:
Core Nodes:
“We bring additional security level around this set of core nodes: we put them inside a perimeter of relay nodes, so core nodes are isolated from the public internet and only relay nodes are allowed to communicate with core nodes. This is how we reduce probability for them being attacked.”
Core nodes never create currency transactions.
Relay Nodes:
You can think of relay nodes as of proxy between core nodes and public internet.
Since relay nodes are not isolated, they can be attacked, but they are in principle stateless and do not have any stake, so they can be moved, or their number can be increased.
If relays are taken down, this does deny service, but the integrity of the core nodes (and the blockchain) should not be compromised.
Since relay nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders.
Cannot create currency transactions.
Relay nodes are fully under the control of the federated committee of initial stakeholders.
Edge Nodes:
Edge node is a simple node that anyone can run on their computer.
Only these nodes can create currency transactions.
Since edge nodes do not have any stake, they cannot be slot leaders as well as relay nodes.
Edge nodes cannot directly communicate with core nodes, only with relay nodes and with other edge nodes.

,hydrozappa,,,,"Cardano is a project that began in 2015 as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed.
“The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration.”
Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed.
“Our large team of expert engineers and researchers drawn from around the world started by deconstructing the concept of a cryptocurrency. Then, incorporating our groundbreaking Proof of Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, the IOHK team employed a first principles approach driven by peer reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.”
Cardano is the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet, a product that brings together such disciplines as distributed systems, mechanism design and cryptography.
Cardano’s multi layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run next-generation smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.
As a whole, the protocol’s design is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators.
“We have designed a system that can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and are installing a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.”
In the spirit of many open source projects, Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. Rather, it embraced a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. These include the following:
Separation of accounting and computation into different layers
Implementation of core components in highly modular functional code
Small groups of academics and developers competing with peer reviewed research
Heavy use of interdisciplinary teams including early use of InfoSec experts
Fast iteration between white papers, implementation and new research required to correct issues discovered during review
Building in the ability to upgrade post-deployed systems without destroying the network
Development of a decentralized funding mechanism for future work
A long-term view on improving the design of cryptocurrencies so they can work on mobile devices with a reasonable and secure user experience
Bringing stakeholders closer to the operations and maintenance of their cryptocurrency
Acknowledging the need to account for multiple assets in the same ledger
Abstracting transactions to include optional metadata in order to better conform to the needs of legacy systems
Learning from the nearly 1,000 altcoins by embracing features that make sense
Adopt a standards-driven process inspired by the Internet Engineering Task Force using a dedicated foundation to lock down the final protocol design
Explore the social elements of commerce
Find a healthy middle ground for regulators to interact with commerce without compromising some core principles inherited from Bitcoin
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.
Cardano is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.
The Cardano development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.
Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion.
Cardano is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language.
The aggregation of our principled exploration of the cryptocurrency space is two collections of protocols:
A provably secure proof of stake based cryptocurrency called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.
You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws.
Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason: It is the first component of the Cardano Platform.
CSL’s consensus algorithm is controlled by a diverse and increasingly more decentralized set of actors or their delegated assigns.
While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.
The value ledger is called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). As the purpose is to account for value, the roadmap has the following goals:
Support two sets of scripting languages, one to move value and another to enhance overlay protocol support
Provide support for KMZ sidechains to link to other ledgers
Support multiple types of signature including quantum resistant signatures for higher security
Support multiple user issued assets
Achieve true scalability, meaning as more users join, the capabilities of the system increase
A set of protocols called the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL).
With CCL, it is possible to create a special purpose token held by delegates of that ledger who could be regulated entities, thereby creating a permissioned ledger.
The flexibility of this approach allows for different instances of CCL to materialize with different rules about the evaluation of transactions. For example, gambling activities could be restricted unless KYC/AML data is present simply by blacklisting non-attributed transactions.
“Our design emphasis is to accommodate the social aspects of cryptocurrencies, build in layers by separating the accounting of value from complex computation, and address the needs of regulators within the scope of several immutable principles.”
Cardano modularity allows for features such as delegation, sidechains, sub-scribable checkpoints, better data structures for light clients, different forms of random number generation and even different synchronization assumptions. As a network develops from having thousands to millions and even billions of users, the requirements of its consensus algorithm will also change. Thus, it is vital to have enough flexibility to accommodate these changes and thereby future-proof the heart of a cryptocurrency.
“We argue that users of a protocol need incentives to understand the social contract behind their protocol and have the freedom to propose changes in a productive way. This freedom extends to every aspect of a value exchange system, from deciding how markets should be regulated to which projects should be funded. Yet it cannot be brokered through centralized actors nor require some special credential that could be co-opted by a well funded minority.”
“Our hope is that Cardano will eventually include a formal, blockchain based system to propose and vote on both soft and hard forks. Bitcoin with its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO fork, and many other cryptocurrencies besides have endured long standing and, in frequent cases, unresolved arguments over the technical and moral direction of the codebase.”
Cardano is a financial system that accepts its social nature.
Cardano’s design borrows from TCP/IP the concept of separation of concerns. In other words, separation of value from computation. This separation does not mean that Cardano will not support smart contracts. On the contrary, by making the separation explicit, it permits significantly more flexibility in the design, use, privacy and execution of smart contracts.
With respect to sidechains, Cardano will support a new protocol developed by Kiayias, Miller and Zindros (KMZ sidechains) based upon prior results from proofs of proofs of work.
The concept allows for the secure and non-interactive movement of funds from CSL to any Cardano Computation Layer or other blockchain supporting the protocol.
KMZ sidechains are the key to encapsulating complexity.
“For Cardano, we decided to start with using elliptic curve cryptography, the Ed25519 curve in particular. We also decided to enhance the existing libraries by adding support for HD wallets using Dr Dmitry Khovratovich and Jason Law’s Specification.”
“We are interested in integrating BLISS-B to add quantum computer resistant signatures to our system. We are also interested in adding SECP256k1 to enhance interoperability with legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.”
“Cardano has been designed with special extensions that will allow us to add more signature schemes through a soft fork.”
Cardano has adopted a pragmatic approach to multi-asset accounting. Building in stages, the first challenge is designing the necessary infrastructure to support the demands of thousands of UIAs. Namely the following advancements are necessary:
Special purpose authenticated data structures to permit the tracking of a very large UTXO state.
The ability to have a distributed mempool to hold a huge set of pending transactions.
Blockchain partitioning and checkpoints to permit a huge global blockchain.
An incentive scheme that rewards consensus nodes for including different sets of transactions.
A subscription mechanic that allows users to decide which currencies they want to track.

My thinking is as I have less money now I should invest in coins for a short term return as their prices are blowing up, I feel next year I will work and id still be able to afford cardano whereas some coins may blow up and il be priced out. Its just my opinion, my circumstances, thats the reason for my decision. I still own cardano as I bought at 0.03. Im waiting patiently for the roadmap. Its really exciting, dont make rash and impulsive decisions, monitor what happens. If you have money for long term holding buy and leave.

Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"First of all, I applaud wanting to understand both NEO and Cardano. Unfortunately, the amount of misinformation in this thread and amongst most redditers is staggering; and you're going to get the wrong read on what's actually true if you do that by reading off a laundry list of what is being touted as 'rumored features'. You are going to have to read up on what the blockchains _actually_ support now and here, what they _say_ they are going to support, and then try and assess whether you think its likely they will succeed. And that can be very hard to do, because it sometimes involves digging into code, or knowing enough math to closely read the whitepapers and identify when vague bullshit statements appear with no backing.

For example: Both NEO and Cardano use proof-of-stake based consensus algorithms. Both NEO and Cardano currently own all of the consensus nodes, i.e., they technically dictate the truth on the blockchain right now (centralized). The difference? NEO's consensus algorithm has changed theory multiple times, and they still haven't settled on one that will effectively protect the network against a range of attacks - that should worry you; they also have no official timeline on when they will let others run staking nodes - that should also worry you. Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is peer-reviewed, meaning at least some portion of incredibly smart cryptographers have looked over its theory and agreed that it survives scientific review - i.e., you can trust that at least the math and theory behind it seems somewhat solid; Cardano has an announced timeline, after which the 'bootstrap era' will end and other staking nodes will be able to run - 3 months from now approximately.

On the surface those two situations look similar, but there is a _huge_ difference. You will run into the same thing with the code execution you're talking about; on the surface it looks like both NEO and Cardano allow running code on the blockchain. But the approaches taken are night and day. Saying they basically 'both do this', is like saying that any two vehicles are the same because they both drive on roads - whether it's a horse cart, ferrari or a truck.

Cardano and other blockchains face a huge challenge in trying to communicate some of these things effectively, because even as an MSc in Computer Science and someone who's spending a good amount of hours looking into these things on a daily basis, it's hard for me to follow and decipher what's up and down.",True,,,,0,1507931880,,1507932305,0,dobzva2,False,t3_763rjd,t1_dobbh81,1509806465,14,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/763rjd/how_does_cardanao_compare_to_eth_neo_and_ark_etc/dobzva2/,,

,demetrius2012,,,,"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The roadmap provided alot of what people expected, and few surprises - this is fine from my point of view. There are a few areas I would consider working on moving forward: 

1. Make interviews/videos shorter. There are too many 45 minute videos explaining exactly the same thing about ADA (and frankly, with too much fluff on 3rd gen blockchain and not enough emphasis on quick comparisons of how ADA shakes up the market). Give people 5 minute clips and make this feel accessible. For instance, if you release a roadmap and have a month where no software is being released and just a countdown clock is running, I would think you could take each of the key sections of that section of the roadmap and build out a small series of 5 minute videos explaining why each component matters, and emphasize why each release must occur in that specific order for ADA to succeed. The team is doing advanced stuff and the general public simply doesn't understand all of it - make the value proposition more tangible (i.e. sure, we could release smart contracts tomorrow, but that would lead to x,y,z so it must be done like this). Shorter videos allow systematic deconstruction of invalid points and time to assess where value creation is occurring - for Cardano, alot of that value creation is in the way it is being developed and this is super intangible to ""normal people"" despite its importance. 

2. If you don't find a way of building off the roadmap each month through video explanations of each section, or weekly questions on each portion of the roadmap, then I honestly think you should drop the countdown clock. It doesn't mean anything other than hype and I am not a fan of coins with verbal hype and no releases to back it up. A website with no release dates and generic time frames that are 6 months out aren't too helpful with a coin this new. I think guaranteed quarterly or 6 month software releases would be more meaningful. 

3. If you keep up the the roadmaps, release more information. A roadmap changes, sure. But inviting the community to comment on something where we don't even actually know where you are headed, makes it difficult to provide feedback. Every decision has a ripple effect. We are looking at a small snapshot of the ADA vision, so how can we say whether or not this first section of the roadmap is appropriate or not since we don't know how it is meant to plug in to the future releases? I think a minimum of a 1 year vision should be in a roadmap so the community can actually see where things are going and provide real feedback on priorities. 

4. Keep up the community engagement. It has been great to have so many members of the IOHK team available to answer questions on here and to engage the community.

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

It provides the adaptability and flexibility across the whole platform so that new blockchains are not needed to solve problems, the modifications can be made without forking the settlement layer (main blockchain) by placing the smart contracts and programmatic coding languages in the computational layer which would not require modifying the PoS algorithm or the blockchain itself to do so.

&gt;Cardano are entering a very competitive space but are bringing a lot to the table.  They are currently listed on Bittrex and there are plans to sell ADA it out of ATM machines in Japan. You can even get an ADA debit card.

&gt;This is a really impressive company who will become serious competitors to the leading Blockchain technologies currently in the market space (and emerging ones). They have a strong team but are also hiring so there is a lot of room for this project to go. Cardano put a strong emphasis on transparency, being open source and striving to become the best Blockchain possible.

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

Ultimately it's difficult to adapt blockchains to make them fit for specific applications or use cases. That's why Cardano was designed and built from scratch in Haskell code to be a highly secure blockchain. It allows formal verification of code, and easy extensibility through a layered architecture.

The vast majority of IOHK (engineering company co-founded by Charles) resources are devoted towards developing Cardano, but they also work on ETC. They are not competing projects per se, as Cardano has a completely different architecture, with the world's first provably secure PoS algorithm Ouroboros driving it. IOHK is contracted to work on Cardano till at least 2020 and may well be working on Cardano much longer.

The projects are not in direct competition, and Cardano benefits from the expertise learnt by IOHK in their work on ETC.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

It is enough to be convinced when considering the vision and scale of the Cardano project.
In order for this project to be successful in the future, it should be preceded by creating an environment in which the ADA coin can be used and allowing it to be retained by many people.
In this sense, the following management strategies are needed.

1. You need to strengthen your marketing skills so that even one person can know the existence of Cardano and ADA to many people.

2. You have to worry about what kind of incentives will be given to the holder who loves Cardano and strives for marketing with affection.

3. Build a network with a variety of app developers who are launching on the Cardano platform.

4. It is necessary to diversify the ADA exchange channel.

I hope Caradano project have a great success.

향후, 이 프로젝트가 성공하기 위해서는 ADA코인이 사용되어질 수 있는 환경을 조성함과 동시에 많은 사람들에게 보유될 수 있도록 하는 것이 선행되어야 한다. 그런 의미에서 다음과 같은 경영전략이 필요하리라 본다.
1. 한 사람이라도 많은 사람에게 카르다노와 ADA의 존재를 알 수 있도록 마케팅력을 강화해야 한다.
2. 카르다노를 사랑하고 애정을 가지고 마케팅에 노력하는 보유자에게 어떠한 인센티브를 줄 것인가를 고민해야 한다.
3. 카르다노 플랫폼에 론칭되는 여러 어플개발자와의 네트워크를 구축해 가야 한다.

,cardanojohn,,,,"Cardano does currently have a very high Asian participation. Thats because the project was germinated from the idea that the Asian market was ripe and open for new financial stack and had not been saturated by cryptocurrencies like the west. A cryptocurrency that succeeded in this might go onto transforming developing regions by offering those who are ignored by traditional banks blockchain enabled financial services. 

Then from a regulatory perspective as well, there are benefits to Cardano from having done the pre-sale in countries where there is no question of whether such a sale is legitimate. With no US participation in the sale, it also alleviates some of the SEC pressures which other cryptocurrencies have faced by performing ICO’s with Americans. The sale was performed by a Japanese entity who performed detailed KYC checks. This means they knew the difference between the amount of transactions and people. So for example, there were roughly 14K transactions that occurred over different tranches. With other cryptocurrencies, 8k of those could have been from a single person, creating a huge inequality in distribution. With Cardano we know that 9,912 people that participated, because they all went through compliance.

Cardano is not unique in having a geographic centre for its pre sale, Filecoin which was 100% US. What started in Asia, has now become global. You have an opportunity to purchase tokens on Bittrex and soon a number of other exchanges. Cardano is focused on become an industrial strength blockchain that can operate in regulated industries. The way in which the sale was performed with KYC and compliance will only be helpful to that aspiration.

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes.

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

,hydrozappa,,,,"Cardano is a project that began in 2015 as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed.
“The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration.”
Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed.
“Our large team of expert engineers and researchers drawn from around the world started by deconstructing the concept of a cryptocurrency. Then, incorporating our groundbreaking Proof of Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, the IOHK team employed a first principles approach driven by peer reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.”
Cardano is the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet, a product that brings together such disciplines as distributed systems, mechanism design and cryptography.
Cardano’s multi layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run next-generation smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.
As a whole, the protocol’s design is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators.
“We have designed a system that can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and are installing a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.”
In the spirit of many open source projects, Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. Rather, it embraced a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. These include the following:
Separation of accounting and computation into different layers
Implementation of core components in highly modular functional code
Small groups of academics and developers competing with peer reviewed research
Heavy use of interdisciplinary teams including early use of InfoSec experts
Fast iteration between white papers, implementation and new research required to correct issues discovered during review
Building in the ability to upgrade post-deployed systems without destroying the network
Development of a decentralized funding mechanism for future work
A long-term view on improving the design of cryptocurrencies so they can work on mobile devices with a reasonable and secure user experience
Bringing stakeholders closer to the operations and maintenance of their cryptocurrency
Acknowledging the need to account for multiple assets in the same ledger
Abstracting transactions to include optional metadata in order to better conform to the needs of legacy systems
Learning from the nearly 1,000 altcoins by embracing features that make sense
Adopt a standards-driven process inspired by the Internet Engineering Task Force using a dedicated foundation to lock down the final protocol design
Explore the social elements of commerce
Find a healthy middle ground for regulators to interact with commerce without compromising some core principles inherited from Bitcoin
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.
Cardano is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.
The Cardano development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.
Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion.
Cardano is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language.
The aggregation of our principled exploration of the cryptocurrency space is two collections of protocols:
A provably secure proof of stake based cryptocurrency called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.
You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws.
Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason: It is the first component of the Cardano Platform.
CSL’s consensus algorithm is controlled by a diverse and increasingly more decentralized set of actors or their delegated assigns.
While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.
The value ledger is called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). As the purpose is to account for value, the roadmap has the following goals:
Support two sets of scripting languages, one to move value and another to enhance overlay protocol support
Provide support for KMZ sidechains to link to other ledgers
Support multiple types of signature including quantum resistant signatures for higher security
Support multiple user issued assets
Achieve true scalability, meaning as more users join, the capabilities of the system increase
A set of protocols called the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL).
With CCL, it is possible to create a special purpose token held by delegates of that ledger who could be regulated entities, thereby creating a permissioned ledger.
The flexibility of this approach allows for different instances of CCL to materialize with different rules about the evaluation of transactions. For example, gambling activities could be restricted unless KYC/AML data is present simply by blacklisting non-attributed transactions.
“Our design emphasis is to accommodate the social aspects of cryptocurrencies, build in layers by separating the accounting of value from complex computation, and address the needs of regulators within the scope of several immutable principles.”
Cardano modularity allows for features such as delegation, sidechains, sub-scribable checkpoints, better data structures for light clients, different forms of random number generation and even different synchronization assumptions. As a network develops from having thousands to millions and even billions of users, the requirements of its consensus algorithm will also change. Thus, it is vital to have enough flexibility to accommodate these changes and thereby future-proof the heart of a cryptocurrency.
“We argue that users of a protocol need incentives to understand the social contract behind their protocol and have the freedom to propose changes in a productive way. This freedom extends to every aspect of a value exchange system, from deciding how markets should be regulated to which projects should be funded. Yet it cannot be brokered through centralized actors nor require some special credential that could be co-opted by a well funded minority.”
“Our hope is that Cardano will eventually include a formal, blockchain based system to propose and vote on both soft and hard forks. Bitcoin with its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO fork, and many other cryptocurrencies besides have endured long standing and, in frequent cases, unresolved arguments over the technical and moral direction of the codebase.”
Cardano is a financial system that accepts its social nature.
Cardano’s design borrows from TCP/IP the concept of separation of concerns. In other words, separation of value from computation. This separation does not mean that Cardano will not support smart contracts. On the contrary, by making the separation explicit, it permits significantly more flexibility in the design, use, privacy and execution of smart contracts.
With respect to sidechains, Cardano will support a new protocol developed by Kiayias, Miller and Zindros (KMZ sidechains) based upon prior results from proofs of proofs of work.
The concept allows for the secure and non-interactive movement of funds from CSL to any Cardano Computation Layer or other blockchain supporting the protocol.
KMZ sidechains are the key to encapsulating complexity.
“For Cardano, we decided to start with using elliptic curve cryptography, the Ed25519 curve in particular. We also decided to enhance the existing libraries by adding support for HD wallets using Dr Dmitry Khovratovich and Jason Law’s Specification.”
“We are interested in integrating BLISS-B to add quantum computer resistant signatures to our system. We are also interested in adding SECP256k1 to enhance interoperability with legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.”
“Cardano has been designed with special extensions that will allow us to add more signature schemes through a soft fork.”
Cardano has adopted a pragmatic approach to multi-asset accounting. Building in stages, the first challenge is designing the necessary infrastructure to support the demands of thousands of UIAs. Namely the following advancements are necessary:
Special purpose authenticated data structures to permit the tracking of a very large UTXO state.
The ability to have a distributed mempool to hold a huge set of pending transactions.
Blockchain partitioning and checkpoints to permit a huge global blockchain.
An incentive scheme that rewards consensus nodes for including different sets of transactions.
A subscription mechanic that allows users to decide which currencies they want to track.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"First of all, I applaud wanting to understand both NEO and Cardano. Unfortunately, the amount of misinformation in this thread and amongst most redditers is staggering; and you're going to get the wrong read on what's actually true if you do that by reading off a laundry list of what is being touted as 'rumored features'. You are going to have to read up on what the blockchains _actually_ support now and here, what they _say_ they are going to support, and then try and assess whether you think its likely they will succeed. And that can be very hard to do, because it sometimes involves digging into code, or knowing enough math to closely read the whitepapers and identify when vague bullshit statements appear with no backing.

For example: Both NEO and Cardano use proof-of-stake based consensus algorithms. Both NEO and Cardano currently own all of the consensus nodes, i.e., they technically dictate the truth on the blockchain right now (centralized). The difference? NEO's consensus algorithm has changed theory multiple times, and they still haven't settled on one that will effectively protect the network against a range of attacks - that should worry you; they also have no official timeline on when they will let others run staking nodes - that should also worry you. Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is peer-reviewed, meaning at least some portion of incredibly smart cryptographers have looked over its theory and agreed that it survives scientific review - i.e., you can trust that at least the math and theory behind it seems somewhat solid; Cardano has an announced timeline, after which the 'bootstrap era' will end and other staking nodes will be able to run - 3 months from now approximately.

On the surface those two situations look similar, but there is a _huge_ difference. You will run into the same thing with the code execution you're talking about; on the surface it looks like both NEO and Cardano allow running code on the blockchain. But the approaches taken are night and day. Saying they basically 'both do this', is like saying that any two vehicles are the same because they both drive on roads - whether it's a horse cart, ferrari or a truck.

Cardano and other blockchains face a huge challenge in trying to communicate some of these things effectively, because even as an MSc in Computer Science and someone who's spending a good amount of hours looking into these things on a daily basis, it's hard for me to follow and decipher what's up and down.",True,,,,0,1507931880,,1507932305,0,dobzva2,False,t3_763rjd,t1_dobbh81,1509806465,14,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/763rjd/how_does_cardanao_compare_to_eth_neo_and_ark_etc/dobzva2/,,

Speaking after his presentation, Professor Kiayias said: “We’re very happy that we had the opportunity to present Ouroboros at the conference. The protocol and especially its security analysis were very well received by fellow cryptographers.”

“Our next steps will be to focus on the next version of the protocol, Ouroboros Praos which improves even further the security and performance characteristics of the protocol.”

The Ouroboros protocol stands out as the first proof of stake algorithm that is provably secure, meaning that it offers security guarantees that are mathematically proven. This is essential for a protocol that is intended to be used in cryptocurrency, an infrastructure that must be relied on to carry billions of dollars worth of value. In addition to security, if blockchains are going to become infrastructure for new financial systems they must be able to comfortably handle millions of users. The key to scaling up is proof of stake, a far more energy efficient and cost effective algorithm, and as such this research represents a significant step forward in cryptography.

The layer that holds ADA has been live for a little while now and the Cardano people are working hard to keep up with minor bugs and software development, as well as all the other things a block chain dev and research team  deals with.

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"First of all, I applaud wanting to understand both NEO and Cardano. Unfortunately, the amount of misinformation in this thread and amongst most redditers is staggering; and you're going to get the wrong read on what's actually true if you do that by reading off a laundry list of what is being touted as 'rumored features'. You are going to have to read up on what the blockchains _actually_ support now and here, what they _say_ they are going to support, and then try and assess whether you think its likely they will succeed. And that can be very hard to do, because it sometimes involves digging into code, or knowing enough math to closely read the whitepapers and identify when vague bullshit statements appear with no backing.

For example: Both NEO and Cardano use proof-of-stake based consensus algorithms. Both NEO and Cardano currently own all of the consensus nodes, i.e., they technically dictate the truth on the blockchain right now (centralized). The difference? NEO's consensus algorithm has changed theory multiple times, and they still haven't settled on one that will effectively protect the network against a range of attacks - that should worry you; they also have no official timeline on when they will let others run staking nodes - that should also worry you. Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is peer-reviewed, meaning at least some portion of incredibly smart cryptographers have looked over its theory and agreed that it survives scientific review - i.e., you can trust that at least the math and theory behind it seems somewhat solid; Cardano has an announced timeline, after which the 'bootstrap era' will end and other staking nodes will be able to run - 3 months from now approximately.

On the surface those two situations look similar, but there is a _huge_ difference. You will run into the same thing with the code execution you're talking about; on the surface it looks like both NEO and Cardano allow running code on the blockchain. But the approaches taken are night and day. Saying they basically 'both do this', is like saying that any two vehicles are the same because they both drive on roads - whether it's a horse cart, ferrari or a truck.

Cardano and other blockchains face a huge challenge in trying to communicate some of these things effectively, because even as an MSc in Computer Science and someone who's spending a good amount of hours looking into these things on a daily basis, it's hard for me to follow and decipher what's up and down.",True,,,,0,1507931880,,1507932305,0,dobzva2,False,t3_763rjd,t1_dobbh81,1509806465,14,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/763rjd/how_does_cardanao_compare_to_eth_neo_and_ark_etc/dobzva2/,,

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

At this point, I would rather place my bets on Cardano with the kind of people Cardano has working for the project. Cardano is also not short on funds.

Always be careful when trading, don’t listen to anyone’s prediction. If they claim they got it right before, well, the chances where 50-50. It would be a shame to lose money by trading. A lot of people do.

And just what are these counter claims, specifically? 

That Cardano was developed elsewhere on a certain date? 

That Cardano was copied/forked from Cardano Labo? 

That Cardano was developed as a gaming platform initially? 

You are going to have to be specific here. And here's how you can word it, in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters.

Begin with: ""On January X, 201X, John Doe, of Cardona Labo, created a gaming platform for these reasons and etc.,"" Write logical sentences, building your case as you go, without emotional accusations that carry zero weight in the land of reasonable people, and come to some clear conclusion. 

Add references to evidence that support your specific, identifiable and reasonable conclusions. 

Example: (Here is the evidence.) 

Exhibit A: Affidavit from CEO John Doe attesting that he originally financed the development of Cardano Labo, before Cardano existed. 

Exhibit B: YouTube video certified as original (unedited) of CFO Sam Doe, Cardano Labo, dated January X, 2016, indicating he actually created Cardano Labo in China at XYZ Labs three years before Hoshkinson did;  

Exhibit C: A Cardano Labo Github pull request from ""ethereumcharles"" showing that on February X, 201X, Cardano was forked from Cardano Labo.

,FyarGyal,,,,"Thank you Danesjold. 
Parts of your comment may be useful to  wukifnee. 
Since you have attached your comment under mine, let me say by means of  clarification and by way of response:

1. The main point of my comment was: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""
2. I find your choice of some words/ phrases puzzling:

   a) You wrote: ""these accusations are false"". I have read each comment closely and can find no accusations being made in any of them. Just some confusion, and doubts being expressed.

   b) You wrote: ""[...] in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" I gave up trying to decipher what you meant by these words. The phrase/ pseudo sentence ""To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" is most unclear. Who was this phrase aimed at and to what purpose? By all means clarify if you wish to do so, but do so at your own peril - the phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind.

   c) You wrote: ""Do you understand the idea? For now, if you were one of my investigators, I'd request that you rewrite your report and resubmit for review."" This remark is clearly addressed to me and I take exception to it. How patronizing and what a mess! What report? 

      Tread carefully when making remarks like c) above. You are doing no service to IOHL by writing ""this type of thing"" and you don't know who I am. The phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind again.


Danesjold, I hope you're not zoning out or getting your back up. I have no reason to assume that your intentions are other than good, so I write the following in order to be helpful:

1. I have no concrete reason at the moment to believe that there is anything less than above board as regards either Charles, IOHK or IOHK's Cardano project.
2. I wrote: ""I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular, but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation"". This was poor wording on my part. 

   a) I did not state what my concerns are. This was remiss of me. However my concerns are indeed marginal (a word chosen carefully). 
 
   b) The wording leads itself open to the interpretation that I may have begun an investigation of some sort. I have not and have no intention of doing so.
 
   c) I would say in passing that, if there were a number of disgruntled investors in a previous ""Cardano"" project, it would be up to them to organize themselves and conduct their own investigation. I am sure they would do so in a proper fashion and certainly not approach this reddit for advice/ clarification/ information. I think that this point should be made, however, lest I give the wrong impression I should state that I have no reason to suspect that their investigations would lead them in any meaningful way to IOHK and IOHK's ""Cardano"" project.

I conclude by reiterating the main point of my previous post: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""

Life is short. I would prefer not to be involved further (unless, of course, you give me a bone to chew).

I hope the above is helpful :) ",True,,,,0,1509659565,,1509661264,0,dp9dxm8,False,t3_7a1101,t1_dp8gojd,1512063752,3,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7a1101/cardano_was_originally_annouced_as_gaming/dp9dxm8/,,public

,FyarGyal,,,,"Thank you Danesjold. 
Parts of your comment may be useful to  wukifnee. 
Since you have attached your comment under mine, let me say by means of  clarification and by way of response:

1. The main point of my comment was: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""
2. I find your choice of some words/ phrases puzzling:

   a) You wrote: ""these accusations are false"". I have read each comment closely and can find no accusations being made in any of them. Just some confusion, and doubts being expressed.

   b) You wrote: ""[...] in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" I gave up trying to decipher what you meant by these words. The phrase/ pseudo sentence ""To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" is most unclear. Who was this phrase aimed at and to what purpose? By all means clarify if you wish to do so, but do so at your own peril - the phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind.

   c) You wrote: ""Do you understand the idea? For now, if you were one of my investigators, I'd request that you rewrite your report and resubmit for review."" This remark is clearly addressed to me and I take exception to it. How patronizing and what a mess! What report? 

      Tread carefully when making remarks like c) above. You are doing no service to IOHL by writing ""this type of thing"" and you don't know who I am. The phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind again.


Danesjold, I hope you're not zoning out or getting your back up. I have no reason to assume that your intentions are other than good, so I write the following in order to be helpful:

1. I have no concrete reason at the moment to believe that there is anything less than above board as regards either Charles, IOHK or IOHK's Cardano project.
2. I wrote: ""I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular, but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation"". This was poor wording on my part. 

   a) I did not state what my concerns are. This was remiss of me. However my concerns are indeed marginal (a word chosen carefully). 
 
   b) The wording leads itself open to the interpretation that I may have begun an investigation of some sort. I have not and have no intention of doing so.
 
   c) I would say in passing that, if there were a number of disgruntled investors in a previous ""Cardano"" project, it would be up to them to organize themselves and conduct their own investigation. I am sure they would do so in a proper fashion and certainly not approach this reddit for advice/ clarification/ information. I think that this point should be made, however, lest I give the wrong impression I should state that I have no reason to suspect that their investigations would lead them in any meaningful way to IOHK and IOHK's ""Cardano"" project.

I conclude by reiterating the main point of my previous post: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""

Life is short. I would prefer not to be involved further (unless, of course, you give me a bone to chew).

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

,[deleted],,,,"Hey there, I need to respectfully contribute in clarifying that the coin supply will NOT have any effect on the price of the coin.  When people note the huge supply, they for some reason seem to think that value will be negatively affected.  This is incorrect and is most certainly not the case.  What will effect the value of the coin: 

1. Technological advancement that goes beyond the realms of the other coins.
2.  Networking and forming strategic partnerships with the right worldly establishments and perhaps even fellow competitors. 
3.  Effective promotion of the product and it's applications on a global level.
4.  Standing out from the crowd and delivering timeously in terms of the set out roadmap.

If the world comes to know and trust the product, in time it'll become extremely valuable. 

I don't for one moment think I am sucking figures out of fresh air.  If you take into consideration, the extreme volatility of the crypto market, $300.00 is 100% achievable.   It just depends on Cardano's strategic manoverability in the market place.  Watch..... We are going to be positively surprised!!!!  Patience and if you're in for the long term, don't even worry about looking at the value for The next 12 months.

,RayMetz100,,,,"Look at the top 5 stocks as an example.  What were the top 5 stocks 5 years ago?  Notice how all 5 went up together.  Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.  You will miss all the new coins and find your old #70-100 collection became an average of #120.

I was looking forward to the roadmap announcement this time. I will expect it next time.
This announcement seemed to be great information for pre-sale and ADA owners who have been watching the development of CARDANO for a long time since launch. However, those who were recently aware of CARDANO and ADA felt that it is very difficult to be honest, what is written when seeing the contents, and what it means. I understand that the technical content is great, but what we do with it If we do not announce what we will be able to do as a platform, we can not predict what will be possible as a platform, I thought that I do not feel much attractive. As a matter of fact, a child was born this year and I'm attaching something called the Maternal and Child Handbook of Japan.

My thinking is as I have less money now I should invest in coins for a short term return as their prices are blowing up, I feel next year I will work and id still be able to afford cardano whereas some coins may blow up and il be priced out. Its just my opinion, my circumstances, thats the reason for my decision. I still own cardano as I bought at 0.03. Im waiting patiently for the roadmap.

,[deleted],,,,"Hey there BTCLOGO....  

First and foremost I kindly request that you google IOHK and visit their website, this is the company that is developing Cardano along with various other extremely well reputed establishments which you would be able to gain further insight into if you do further investigations via the internet from the resources at hand.

Now visit Youtube, search Cardano and take the time to do an in depth assessment of all posts from various parties involved in the project, as well as independent reviews from various different Youtuber's.

Now visit all the reviews and news posts from various different websites which are really easy to find if you do the neccesary search via your favourite search engine.

If you are able to take the time to go through all the information at hand, which I propose all investors do prior to making an investment of any kind, you will come to see just who you are dealing with and the scope for huge progress in many different regards relating to the Cardano project and the ADA coin.

I could go on and on promoting Cardano and for so many different reasons, however the fact of the matter is that everyone has to do their own investigations and come up with their own conclusion, and on that note my personal conclusion is as follows:

1.  These guys are 100% transparent and professional and this is made very clear through the Cardano website in the form of audit and regular progress reports which are made available to the public.
2.  The Cardano team and associates involved with the development of the product extend cross border, within the region of 6 different countries having individuals involved and their collective intelligence as a team is in my opinion beyond astounding.
3.  Key players in the Cardano team have loads of experience in the crypto currency environment from their past endeavours and they know exactly what needs to be done in order to take the game to the next level and on a macro global level and most importantly, just how to do it.
4.  The Cardano roadmap is clear and they know exactly where they're going and what needs to be done in order to achieve their objectives and this information is available for all to see.
5.  If these guys say they have technology that is revoutionary and they're in the process of rolling it out, you need to know that it is very real and you can have peace of mind in this regard.
6.  There are so many crypto coins out there, so many lies, so many promises so much hot air, so many scams, sooo much deceit and I am of the certain belief that in the most positive of ways, Cardano stands way out from 85% of the market, based on credentials and the level of credibility that the key players, developers and the rest of their team have earned thus far.

The world needs to come to Cardano, the world needs to embrace the sound ethics of Cardano, the world will come to see the strength of this amazing endeavour and I strongly urge all to partake in this awesome opportunity.   ADA is here and it's the future of crypto, mark my words.  You can be a fly on the wall or you can reach for the sky... Cardano is going to take us there and if you snooze, you loose ;)

,RayMetz100,,,,"Look at the top 5 stocks as an example.  What were the top 5 stocks 5 years ago?  Notice how all 5 went up together.  Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.  You will miss all the new coins and find your old #70-100 collection became an average of #120.

But yeah, it helps if it does not drop in my salary terms.

Cardano is still a very young system. They are currently developing only one module of the several that will eventually build their platform. The coin is worth its current price, no more. Any spike is based on expectations, and competition is tough out there, every month you get new projects solving new problems. So hype will eventually be compensated with realizations of lack of maturity and interest in other projects.

It is an interesting coin, and it seems to be developing a good community around which adds pressure to the buy side.

,cardanojohn,,,,"Cardano does currently have a very high Asian participation. Thats because the project was germinated from the idea that the Asian market was ripe and open for new financial stack and had not been saturated by cryptocurrencies like the west. A cryptocurrency that succeeded in this might go onto transforming developing regions by offering those who are ignored by traditional banks blockchain enabled financial services. 

Then from a regulatory perspective as well, there are benefits to Cardano from having done the pre-sale in countries where there is no question of whether such a sale is legitimate. With no US participation in the sale, it also alleviates some of the SEC pressures which other cryptocurrencies have faced by performing ICO’s with Americans. The sale was performed by a Japanese entity who performed detailed KYC checks. This means they knew the difference between the amount of transactions and people. So for example, there were roughly 14K transactions that occurred over different tranches. With other cryptocurrencies, 8k of those could have been from a single person, creating a huge inequality in distribution. With Cardano we know that 9,912 people that participated, because they all went through compliance.

Cardano is not unique in having a geographic centre for its pre sale, Filecoin which was 100% US. What started in Asia, has now become global. You have an opportunity to purchase tokens on Bittrex and soon a number of other exchanges. Cardano is focused on become an industrial strength blockchain that can operate in regulated industries. The way in which the sale was performed with KYC and compliance will only be helpful to that aspiration.

The Layered Approach, that allows for changes to be made, features to be added, and scale-ability to be increased without the need for a fork.
Also in my opinion PoS is more sustainable than PoW (although ETH soon might change).
I also like that they work closely with various Universities to find the best approaches.

Your point is well taken that we should not want a system that requires creating new blockchains to solve every problem, and that is precisely why Cardano is a positive evolution of blockchain tech in many ways.  It provides the adaptability and flexibility across the whole platform so that new blockchains are not needed to solve problems, the modifications can be made without forking the settlement layer (main blockchain) by placing the smart contracts and programmatic coding languages in the computational layer which would not require modifying the PoS algorithm or the blockchain itself to do so.

I was looking forward to the roadmap announcement this time. I will expect it next time.
This announcement seemed to be great information for pre-sale and ADA owners who have been watching the development of CARDANO for a long time since launch. However, those who were recently aware of CARDANO and ADA felt that it is very difficult to be honest, what is written when seeing the contents, and what it means. I understand that the technical content is great, but what we do with it If we do not announce what we will be able to do as a platform, we can not predict what will be possible as a platform, I thought that I do not feel much attractive. As a matter of fact, a child was born this year and I'm attaching something called the Maternal and Child Handbook of Japan. Although it is different from the roadmap, it is something like an indicator, a record that shows the child growing properly, but it is very easy to understand.

    We've tracked this long enough now to project the value of the 
    asset overall in 3-stages. Market cap ranges of $650mm in stage 
    1, $4billion in stage 2, and closer to $42-44billion for stage 3 
    (2019-2020). ADA is no joke, but it's structured to end up 
    topping out at about $1.00USD total in value for the ADA asset, 
    from what we can see. This will allow an ADA to compete with 
    the global economic space (FIAT side) a lot easier than someone 
    looking at a BTC for $5,000 -$7500 down the road.
    Something to think about.

,FyarGyal,,,,"Things appear to be a bit murky!

I must say at the outset:
1) I have enjoyed watching and listening to Charles Hoskinson over the past couple of years (youTube and so on) - impressive, persuasive.
2) I hold no ADA, so have no skin in the game. However, I hold a few ETCs, so I have some interest.

I have little doubt that Charles was involved with ""Cardano Gaming Group"" (see icedbeverage comment elsewhere, or follow directly here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZqIeZQXHk published by Attain Corporation, 21 Dec 2015).
I commend icedbeverage for his comment: ""This is not fud these are valid concerns. [This video has] ... Hoskinson in them and they talk about a gaming platform. We need to know the full history and if there was anything sketchy or fraudulent.""

By some accounts at the time (about July/ August 2016), CARDANO ADA coin from Cardano Gaming Group somehow failed to deliver and left many Japanese who had invested in it disgruntled (see note 1 below). 

Wukifnee: if you are one of the (allegedly) disgruntled investors, I sympathize.
 
To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.

By the way, there is a company ""CGG Limited"" registered in the Isle of Man, previously named ""Cardano Gaming Group Limited"" and previous to that ""Cardano Limited"" - documents available for download for a modest fee at https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=331585

The Isle of Man info above may be a red herring, however on the face of it, it may be worth looking into, if you're so inclined/ motivated.

I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular , but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation, which would involve (inter-alia) searching japanese language websites in a focussed way.

So do your research wukifnee, contact others, try and build a case and if/ when you feel you have one, apply your information wisely. I wish you good luck.

&gt; When I saw the name of Basho as a Japanese, I was very happy.
I was looking forward to the roadmap announcement this time. I will expect it next time.
This announcement seemed to be great information for pre-sale and ADA owners who have been watching the development of CARDANO for a long time since launch. However, those who were recently aware of CARDANO and ADA felt that it is very difficult to be honest, what is written when seeing the contents, and what it means. I understand that the technical content is great, but what we do with it If we do not announce what we will be able to do as a platform, we can not predict what will be possible as a platform, I thought that I do not feel much attractive. As a matter of fact, a child was born this year and I'm attaching something called the Maternal and Child Handbook of Japan. Although it is different from the roadmap, it is something like an indicator, a record that shows the child growing properly, but it is very easy to understand. I would be pleased if the roadmap would be like a child like CARDANO and I could watch over the growth.

,parakmiakos_trader,,,,"Very nice example of how growth works. Just to add to what I was saying before in regards to growth. Potential adopters of Cardano and people in general that do not understand how growth as you explained it works, see the price of the coin being about 3 cents now and they calculate quickly the market cap required for the coin to reach ethereum's price of $300 and work out that the market cap would have to be huge to reach to that price per ADA. What they don't take into consideration is the percentage growth of the coin it self and factor that percentage into their investment to work out their potential profits ie

I will spend $1000 to buy some ADA now ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 33,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs 30 cents = (33,333 coins X $0.3 per coin = $9,999) 
I made a profit of $9,999 - $1000 initial investment = $8,999



Now let's go to Ethereum

I will spend $1000 to buy some ETH now ($1000 at $300 per coin = roughly 3.33 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $3000 = (3.33 coins X $3000 per coin = $9,990)
I made a profit of $9,990 - $1000 initial investment = $ 8,990

Notice how 1 ADA had to go from 0.03 cents to 0.3 cents and 1 ETH had to go from $300 to $3000 TO MAKE THE SAME profit roughly. The growth of both coins was 10 times up.





Now let's start with both coins from let's say $0.03 with an initial investment of $1000

I will spend $1000 to buy ADA ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ADA coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ADA costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ADA coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $9.3337451e+12. This is not going to happen anytime soon. So IMHO, people should not expect to see 1 ADA costing $300. Which is what Ethereum costs today. The Ethereum boat has sailed. Unless if you want to speculate on the hundreds of ALTcoins out there: https://coinmarketcap.com/ .Who knows, you might get lucky.





I will spend $1000 to buy ETH ($1000 at $0.03 per coin = roughly 3,333 ETH coins).
I will keep the coins until 1 ETH costs $300 = (33,333 coins X $300 per coin = $9,999,900)
I just made a profit of $9,999,900 - $1000 initial investment = $ 9,998,900
This would require a market cap(total amount of ETH coins stored in users' wallets converted to US dollars) of $28620880200. Which is roughly Ethereum's market cap today.



Ethereum tokens can cost $300 each because the total supply of ETH at the moment is 95,402,934 ETH (millions)
ADA tokens total supply is 31,112,483,745 ADA (billions). Which means a looot of people need to be invested in Cardano, for the price to go higher and higher...which means Cardano will have to go mainstream(they are just starting out). Well guess what, cryptos have been around long enough, the world is aware of them, so it might be time to go mainstream. This would require serious people with serious connections backing a blockchain project, as it is a big responsibility. Well these guys at Cardano seem to fulfill the criteria. (you need to reasearch them too, to form your own opinion).

Making profits from buying crypto coins is good, but we should be thinking about how our world will be affected by new technologies yes?


If you are a newbie trying to ride the hype, have a look at all those projects out there on  https://coinmarketcap.com. Make sure you research extensively the ones you might be interested in, and you will realize a whole heap of them are just a joke(there are solid ones too though), trying to make money. That's your money.


If you ask me what the future of the price of ADA will be in let's say the next two years, I am not sure!! I keep googling it but nothing comes up:P


Maybe the Cardano people can help us out here, and I don't believe they will, because they will be speculating which is something they can't do.

,TenaciousJai,,,,"The problems that Cardano solves are those that plague the major currencies, primarily the ability to scale properly into future growth while adding on new functionality and volume in a flexible way without the requirements of forking the original chain or relying on extremely difficult consensus soft fork agreements to fix problems that are were not anticipated in the original code, but are inextricably linked to the core code causing battles over how to solve the problem that damage the value of the currency (obvious examples are BTC/BCH and ETH / ETC (which is another project of input output HK, fyi)).
Cardano resolves these problems by separating the main chain settlement layer from the computational layer, allowing the smart contracts to sit outside of the chain until the transaction is finalized and then written to the settlement layer blockchain. This prevents most of the scalability issues, because the bulk of the work is done outside of the main chain, and any updates to the computational layer can be made without breaking the original chain, including adding new coding languages, etc. Yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum are developing addon projects to do similar things, but the fact that they're addons is a symptom of the problem Cardano is attempting to solve by developing the platform from the ground up to account for the unknown knowns, and the unknown unknowns that might arise in the future.
Bitcoin and Ethereum both have massive scalability issues - bitcoin currently sits at 10-12 tx /sec capacity which is causing factions to fork the chain to solve growing pains and the development of several patches to resolve the issue including a sidechain project (lightning network) to accommodate the needs of the platform, Ethereum has similar load issues which have already forced them to develop another entire project (Raiden) to allow for growth only a couple of years into the roadmap, and it's uncertain how their Proof of Stake system will hold up when PoW ends in a few months since they're only just now releasing Metropolis. Cardano aims to start the platform integrating all of the solutions various coins have come up with into one platform, so that the usability and functionality are scalable, flexible, and predictable well into the future. Something that causes endless headaches for most other currencies that don't have a long-term vision for their development from the start, but rather rely on ad-hoc patching to fix issues as they run into problems along the way.

1) Download the Daedalus wallet from daedaluswallet.io, install the wallet and make sure you can open it and let it sync to the blockchain. This will take maybe an hour(synching blocks, and if you tried to do this a few months later, it would take more time, depending how much blockchain had been created). The Daedalus wallet is the official wallet of Cardano to store your Ada.
2) Reset your computer and open your wallet to make sure it opens.
3) Buy Bitcoin.
4) go to coinswitch.io and follow the prompts, it is straight forward. When you visit coinswitch.io, you want to convert your bitcoin to Ada. You do it this way, because the only way to buy Ada at the moment is to buy bitcoin using your fiat currency, and then use bittrex.com or coinswitch.io to convert your bitcoin to Ada. Coinswitch is easier to use than bittrex.

&gt; In terms of Cardano, what is live now is the first major release of the platform dubbed ""Byron."" This is the first generation of the settlement layer, which is where Ada lives.

&gt;Some functionality is not yet switched on, however, because the platform is currently in bootstrap mode. The system will need a broader distribution of coin holders before it is up and running in full form. So, at this early stage, even though Ouroboros is turned on, consensus is locked to private nodes until the system gathers momentum, and that may take another four to six months, said Hoskinson.

&gt;Following Byron, the next major release of Cardano, dubbed ""Shelley,"" is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2018. During the Shelley phase, the system will evolve into a full-featured, independent cryptocurrency.

&gt;""If I died and IOHK shut down, Cardano could run forever in that form,"" said Hoskinson.

    We've tracked this long enough now to project the value of the 
    asset overall in 3-stages. Market cap ranges of $650mm in stage 
    1, $4billion in stage 2, and closer to $42-44billion for stage 3 
    (2019-2020). ADA is no joke, but it's structured to end up 
    topping out at about $1.00USD total in value for the ADA asset, 
    from what we can see. This will allow an ADA to compete with 
    the global economic space (FIAT side) a lot easier than someone 
    looking at a BTC for $5,000 -$7500 down the road.
    Something to think about.

,zimmah,,,,"&gt; Cardano is working towards allowing the creation of smart contracts using many programming languages, so it will be able to attract lots of developers due to this flexibility.      

    
NEO already has this.  
&gt; Support Java / Kotlin, .NET C # / VB, JavaScript / Typescript,  
   Python, Go      
 Smart Contract Compiler and IDE Plugin      
C# / VB.Net / F#, Visual Studio     
Java / Kotlin, Eclipse     
C / C++ / GO     
JavaScript / TypeScript     
Python / Ruby           
      
.        
     
&gt;  It will also utilise a hardware component in smart phones that will give it the best wallet security.       
     
Not sure if NEO has this, but it's something that can easily be done.     
       
   
&gt; Also its POS algorithm has been peer reviewed and so is known to be secure.       
     
NEO has a better system already. NEO actually works like a share in the network and all NEO holders get paid in GAS based on network usage. essentially paying dividends like a stock.    
unlike PoS this won't cause inflation of the asset.       
   
   
&gt; Next year it will also have a feature that makes it quantum secure.     
   
NEO has Quantum resistant algorithms already.          
     

&gt; It is also based on a scientific philosophy which is hugely important. It also has the best governance system that will allow it to be upgraded without causing chaos.      
         
I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean.        
     
&gt; Those are some of the reasons it will be better than ETH and NEO and there are more.    
     
NEO already has all of that, so I still don't see how its supposed to be better.   
Perhaps maybe on-par.

,FyarGyal,,,,"Thank you Danesjold. 
Parts of your comment may be useful to  wukifnee. 
Since you have attached your comment under mine, let me say by means of  clarification and by way of response:

1. The main point of my comment was: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""
2. I find your choice of some words/ phrases puzzling:

   a) You wrote: ""these accusations are false"". I have read each comment closely and can find no accusations being made in any of them. Just some confusion, and doubts being expressed.

   b) You wrote: ""[...] in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" I gave up trying to decipher what you meant by these words. The phrase/ pseudo sentence ""To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" is most unclear. Who was this phrase aimed at and to what purpose? By all means clarify if you wish to do so, but do so at your own peril - the phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind.

   c) You wrote: ""Do you understand the idea? For now, if you were one of my investigators, I'd request that you rewrite your report and resubmit for review."" This remark is clearly addressed to me and I take exception to it. How patronizing and what a mess! What report? 

      Tread carefully when making remarks like c) above. You are doing no service to IOHL by writing ""this type of thing"" and you don't know who I am. The phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind again.


Danesjold, I hope you're not zoning out or getting your back up. I have no reason to assume that your intentions are other than good, so I write the following in order to be helpful:

1. I have no concrete reason at the moment to believe that there is anything less than above board as regards either Charles, IOHK or IOHK's Cardano project.
2. I wrote: ""I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular, but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation"". This was poor wording on my part. 

   a) I did not state what my concerns are. This was remiss of me. However my concerns are indeed marginal (a word chosen carefully). 
 
   b) The wording leads itself open to the interpretation that I may have begun an investigation of some sort. I have not and have no intention of doing so.
 
   c) I would say in passing that, if there were a number of disgruntled investors in a previous ""Cardano"" project, it would be up to them to organize themselves and conduct their own investigation. I am sure they would do so in a proper fashion and certainly not approach this reddit for advice/ clarification/ information. I think that this point should be made, however, lest I give the wrong impression I should state that I have no reason to suspect that their investigations would lead them in any meaningful way to IOHK and IOHK's ""Cardano"" project.

I conclude by reiterating the main point of my previous post: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""

Life is short. I would prefer not to be involved further (unless, of course, you give me a bone to chew).

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem. I'm also struggling to understand how the blockchain is persists as a whole if it is being partitioned into sub-blockchains.

Hello and welcome to the Cardano(ADA) forum;

My name is Charlie and the purpose of running this forum is to help people understand ADA better as well as promoting this cryptocurrency.
Personally I see a great potential in this cryptocurrency and would like to gather ADA fans in this place, so that everyone of us can benefit from the information shared by other users here. Also it would be ideal if traders can come here and provide their analysis of the market. Besides Cardano's technology is unique, we can build a better future for ADA together.  Smiley

Cardano's team have their own official topics on reddit.com and other forums, but none of them have a warm and friendly environment.
The forum has got simple rules, like any other forums. Please do no spam, do not advertise and do not post any referral links here.

His reaction, would be described on his own logic, at that interview, as not very wise or trustworthy...

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"Even though your account seems to be doing nothing here except trolling, I'm going to respond anyway in case someone happens by your post and goes, 'Hey why IS that'. Full disclosure: I have no affiliation with Cardano, I don't currently own any ADA, and Cardano didn't catch my eye because of Charles Hoskinson at all, but because of Philip Wadler and Elias Koutsoupias who are world-leading researchers within their respective fields of programming language theory and game theory. I'm a programmer with an MSc in software engineering, so while I don't specifically work within blockchain technology right now, I generally know what to look for in software projects, whitepapers and so forth.

&gt; No, it doesn't need to be distributed before it's ready and no, Charles doesn't need a million testers. He has paid employees at IOHK who could setup a network of real and virtual servers to test the network in house.

It has nothing at all to do with 'needing a million testers'. Of course they test things in-house. That aside, releasing something gradually into production is a tried-and-tested method that you will see any competent large-scale software project do (for example Facebook, Google, AWS, and various others if you need examples). Also, 'Charles' doesn't -- Cardano Foundation and IOHK do. This attempted character assassination is tiresome to read through.

&gt; The bootstrap era could have been accomplished via the staff at IOHK, you don't need billions of tokens and millions of dollars in investment to send a few tokens back and forth, because let's be honest, thats all the network can do at this point.

The bootstrap era _is_ being accomplished via IOHK, thats exactly what the bootstrap era is -- the nodes are being run by IOHK. Once Cardano switches to the reward era, nodes will start being run outside of IOHK. In order for a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm to function correctly, the tokens underpinning the economic incentives of staking must be fairly and widely distributed amongst preferably a large number of holders. This was the case with NXT, with BlackCoin, it is the case with NEO, and it will be the case for any other proof-of-stake algorithm relying on a fair and wide distribution of tokens.

&gt; Maybe if there was a basic smart contract platform to test, or maybe if there was even a proof of stake system that worked, then you could justify getting the public involved. But none of those things exist. None! None! None!

By this argument, no blockchain project without fee rewards for staking and active smart contracts is worth being public. By that notion, there are only a very, very, very small number of blockchain projects that 'justify' getting the public involved; and that list does _not_ include bitcoin, ethereum, or any of the current blockchains at all. Ethereum has smart contracts but not PoS, NEO has smart contracts but only bootstrap-era PoS, and so on, and so on. In short, what you're saying makes zero sense and has no bearing on reality.

&gt; Honestly if this project were at this point and being lead by anybody other than Charles, co-founder of Ethereum, this would be a total scam. You would be labeled a scam coin and you know it.

Reasons I care about Cardano:

- It has an active, involved research community counting some of the brightest people on the planet, including the two gentlemen I mentioned at the top.
- They have an _extremely_ active Github, telling me there is a ton of programming activity in the project. Far, far, far more than I've seen in most other crypto projects, by miles.
- They have individuals from Well Typed involved in the project, which are top Haskell consultants with a proven track record.
- They have been exceedingly clear in their communication, their widespread efforts to detail what they are doing and importantly _how_. The how is important, because this space is filled with a ton of bullshit and empty promises, and the how is partway to proving that Cardano is not in that category.

In my opinion, Cardano is one of few projects that have a chance at surviving for a longer time in this space and making real, serious contributions; that may not satisfy moonboys and daytraders, or those creating random accounts to shill or FUD -- but at the end of the day 90% of the companies that spring up around ICOs right now will be dead by the end of 2018, because they have no idea how they're going to do what they sold their ICO on. I'm betting on Cardano not being one of the dead ones, not least because of the points above.",True,,,,0,1509763719,,False,0,dpbjr63,False,t3_7ac7kj,t1_dpabjgr,1512109179,23,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7ac7kj/official_cardano_roadmap_discussion_thread/dpbjr63/,,public

Two questions, one on IELE and one on K:

- There are a _lot_ of virtual machines being built by various crypto projects (Neo has its own VM, Ethereum has its own VM, etc etc), all of which share underlying common goals but may differ in the instruction set, semantics of the VM and so forth. Do you see this landscape consolidating somewhat in the future into some more robust, common virtual machines? And is IELE meant to be specific to Cardano, or do you see it as a thing of its own that can then potentially be used by others outside of Cardano?

- The article says that Runtime Verification is looking to build an improved backend to K that is an order of magnitude faster. Are there any benchmarks for the existing execution speed of K-compiled binaries compared to non-K-compiled binaries? (f.ex gcc vs. kcc execution speed of various semantics, or in one of the other K projects)

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

    We've tracked this long enough now to project the value of the

    1, $4billion in stage 2, and closer to $42-44billion for stage 3 
    (2019-2020). ADA is no joke, but it's structured to end up 
    topping out at about $1.00USD total in value for the ADA asset, 
    from what we can see. This will allow an ADA to compete with 
    the global economic space (FIAT side) a lot easier than someone

    Something to think about.

,hydrozappa,,,,"Cardano is a project that began in 2015 as an effort to change the way cryptocurrencies are designed and developed.
“The overall focus beyond a particular set of innovations is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking integration.”
Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed.
“Our large team of expert engineers and researchers drawn from around the world started by deconstructing the concept of a cryptocurrency. Then, incorporating our groundbreaking Proof of Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, the IOHK team employed a first principles approach driven by peer reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.”
Cardano is the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet, a product that brings together such disciplines as distributed systems, mechanism design and cryptography.
Cardano’s multi layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run next-generation smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.
As a whole, the protocol’s design is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators.
“We have designed a system that can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and are installing a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.”
In the spirit of many open source projects, Cardano did not begin with a comprehensive roadmap or even an authoritative white paper. Rather, it embraced a collection of design principles, engineering best practices and avenues for exploration. These include the following:
Separation of accounting and computation into different layers
Implementation of core components in highly modular functional code
Small groups of academics and developers competing with peer reviewed research
Heavy use of interdisciplinary teams including early use of InfoSec experts
Fast iteration between white papers, implementation and new research required to correct issues discovered during review
Building in the ability to upgrade post-deployed systems without destroying the network
Development of a decentralized funding mechanism for future work
A long-term view on improving the design of cryptocurrencies so they can work on mobile devices with a reasonable and secure user experience
Bringing stakeholders closer to the operations and maintenance of their cryptocurrency
Acknowledging the need to account for multiple assets in the same ledger
Abstracting transactions to include optional metadata in order to better conform to the needs of legacy systems
Learning from the nearly 1,000 altcoins by embracing features that make sense
Adopt a standards-driven process inspired by the Internet Engineering Task Force using a dedicated foundation to lock down the final protocol design
Explore the social elements of commerce
Find a healthy middle ground for regulators to interact with commerce without compromising some core principles inherited from Bitcoin
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.
Cardano is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.
The Cardano development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.
Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion.
Cardano is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language.
The aggregation of our principled exploration of the cryptocurrency space is two collections of protocols:
A provably secure proof of stake based cryptocurrency called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in conjunction with the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.
You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws.
Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason: It is the first component of the Cardano Platform.
CSL’s consensus algorithm is controlled by a diverse and increasingly more decentralized set of actors or their delegated assigns.
While there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.
The value ledger is called the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL). As the purpose is to account for value, the roadmap has the following goals:
Support two sets of scripting languages, one to move value and another to enhance overlay protocol support
Provide support for KMZ sidechains to link to other ledgers
Support multiple types of signature including quantum resistant signatures for higher security
Support multiple user issued assets
Achieve true scalability, meaning as more users join, the capabilities of the system increase
A set of protocols called the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL).
With CCL, it is possible to create a special purpose token held by delegates of that ledger who could be regulated entities, thereby creating a permissioned ledger.
The flexibility of this approach allows for different instances of CCL to materialize with different rules about the evaluation of transactions. For example, gambling activities could be restricted unless KYC/AML data is present simply by blacklisting non-attributed transactions.
“Our design emphasis is to accommodate the social aspects of cryptocurrencies, build in layers by separating the accounting of value from complex computation, and address the needs of regulators within the scope of several immutable principles.”
Cardano modularity allows for features such as delegation, sidechains, sub-scribable checkpoints, better data structures for light clients, different forms of random number generation and even different synchronization assumptions. As a network develops from having thousands to millions and even billions of users, the requirements of its consensus algorithm will also change. Thus, it is vital to have enough flexibility to accommodate these changes and thereby future-proof the heart of a cryptocurrency.
“We argue that users of a protocol need incentives to understand the social contract behind their protocol and have the freedom to propose changes in a productive way. This freedom extends to every aspect of a value exchange system, from deciding how markets should be regulated to which projects should be funded. Yet it cannot be brokered through centralized actors nor require some special credential that could be co-opted by a well funded minority.”
“Our hope is that Cardano will eventually include a formal, blockchain based system to propose and vote on both soft and hard forks. Bitcoin with its block size debate, Ethereum with the DAO fork, and many other cryptocurrencies besides have endured long standing and, in frequent cases, unresolved arguments over the technical and moral direction of the codebase.”
Cardano is a financial system that accepts its social nature.
Cardano’s design borrows from TCP/IP the concept of separation of concerns. In other words, separation of value from computation. This separation does not mean that Cardano will not support smart contracts. On the contrary, by making the separation explicit, it permits significantly more flexibility in the design, use, privacy and execution of smart contracts.
With respect to sidechains, Cardano will support a new protocol developed by Kiayias, Miller and Zindros (KMZ sidechains) based upon prior results from proofs of proofs of work.
The concept allows for the secure and non-interactive movement of funds from CSL to any Cardano Computation Layer or other blockchain supporting the protocol.
KMZ sidechains are the key to encapsulating complexity.
“For Cardano, we decided to start with using elliptic curve cryptography, the Ed25519 curve in particular. We also decided to enhance the existing libraries by adding support for HD wallets using Dr Dmitry Khovratovich and Jason Law’s Specification.”
“We are interested in integrating BLISS-B to add quantum computer resistant signatures to our system. We are also interested in adding SECP256k1 to enhance interoperability with legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.”
“Cardano has been designed with special extensions that will allow us to add more signature schemes through a soft fork.”
Cardano has adopted a pragmatic approach to multi-asset accounting. Building in stages, the first challenge is designing the necessary infrastructure to support the demands of thousands of UIAs. Namely the following advancements are necessary:
Special purpose authenticated data structures to permit the tracking of a very large UTXO state.
The ability to have a distributed mempool to hold a huge set of pending transactions.
Blockchain partitioning and checkpoints to permit a huge global blockchain.
An incentive scheme that rewards consensus nodes for including different sets of transactions.
A subscription mechanic that allows users to decide which currencies they want to track.

In bitshares, a few nodes (~100) are the core consensus nodes and do all the blockchain processing. This is fairly centralized.

To my knowledge, Ouroboros does not set a specific number of core nodes. Rather, it plans to scale by adding more and more nodes are more and more users use the system (I suppose this happens dynamically). The nodes are then partitioned off (sharding) into quorums of nodes to enable it to scale. Sharding is needed because you cannot have thousands or millions of core nodes talking to each other about each and every transaction.

There are also relay nodes and edge nodes (read about it on their website).

I think that (and I might be off here) the real difficult problem is how the different quorums/shards transact with one another. I'm not sure how they plan to solve this problem. I'm also struggling to understand how the blockchain is persists as a whole if it is being partitioned into sub-blockchains.

Parts of your comment may be useful to  wukifnee. 
Since you have attached your comment under mine, let me say by means of  clarification and by way of response:

1. The main point of my comment was: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""
2. I find your choice of some words/ phrases puzzling:

   a) You wrote: ""these accusations are false"". I have read each comment closely and can find no accusations being made in any of them. Just some confusion, and doubts being expressed.

   b) You wrote: ""[...] in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" I gave up trying to decipher what you meant by these words. The phrase/ pseudo sentence ""To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters."" is most unclear. Who was this phrase aimed at and to what purpose? By all means clarify if you wish to do so, but do so at your own peril - the phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind.

   c) You wrote: ""Do you understand the idea? For now, if you were one of my investigators, I'd request that you rewrite your report and resubmit for review."" This remark is clearly addressed to me and I take exception to it. How patronizing and what a mess! What report? 

      Tread carefully when making remarks like c) above. You are doing no service to IOHL by writing ""this type of thing"" and you don't know who I am. The phrase ""don't give a dog a bone to chew"" comes to mind again.


Danesjold, I hope you're not zoning out or getting your back up. I have no reason to assume that your intentions are other than good, so I write the following in order to be helpful:

1. I have no concrete reason at the moment to believe that there is anything less than above board as regards either Charles, IOHK or IOHK's Cardano project.
2. I wrote: ""I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular, but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation"". This was poor wording on my part. 

   a) I did not state what my concerns are. This was remiss of me. However my concerns are indeed marginal (a word chosen carefully). 
 
   b) The wording leads itself open to the interpretation that I may have begun an investigation of some sort. I have not and have no intention of doing so.
 
   c) I would say in passing that, if there were a number of disgruntled investors in a previous ""Cardano"" project, it would be up to them to organize themselves and conduct their own investigation. I am sure they would do so in a proper fashion and certainly not approach this reddit for advice/ clarification/ information. I think that this point should be made, however, lest I give the wrong impression I should state that I have no reason to suspect that their investigations would lead them in any meaningful way to IOHK and IOHK's ""Cardano"" project.

I conclude by reiterating the main point of my previous post: ""To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.""

Life is short. I would prefer not to be involved further (unless, of course, you give me a bone to chew).

,demetrius2012,,,,"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The roadmap provided alot of what people expected, and few surprises - this is fine from my point of view. There are a few areas I would consider working on moving forward: 

1. Make interviews/videos shorter. There are too many 45 minute videos explaining exactly the same thing about ADA (and frankly, with too much fluff on 3rd gen blockchain and not enough emphasis on quick comparisons of how ADA shakes up the market). Give people 5 minute clips and make this feel accessible. For instance, if you release a roadmap and have a month where no software is being released and just a countdown clock is running, I would think you could take each of the key sections of that section of the roadmap and build out a small series of 5 minute videos explaining why each component matters, and emphasize why each release must occur in that specific order for ADA to succeed. The team is doing advanced stuff and the general public simply doesn't understand all of it - make the value proposition more tangible (i.e. sure, we could release smart contracts tomorrow, but that would lead to x,y,z so it must be done like this). Shorter videos allow systematic deconstruction of invalid points and time to assess where value creation is occurring - for Cardano, alot of that value creation is in the way it is being developed and this is super intangible to ""normal people"" despite its importance. 

2. If you don't find a way of building off the roadmap each month through video explanations of each section, or weekly questions on each portion of the roadmap, then I honestly think you should drop the countdown clock. It doesn't mean anything other than hype and I am not a fan of coins with verbal hype and no releases to back it up. A website with no release dates and generic time frames that are 6 months out aren't too helpful with a coin this new. I think guaranteed quarterly or 6 month software releases would be more meaningful. 

3. If you keep up the the roadmaps, release more information. A roadmap changes, sure. But inviting the community to comment on something where we don't even actually know where you are headed, makes it difficult to provide feedback. Every decision has a ripple effect. We are looking at a small snapshot of the ADA vision, so how can we say whether or not this first section of the roadmap is appropriate or not since we don't know how it is meant to plug in to the future releases? I think a minimum of a 1 year vision should be in a roadmap so the community can actually see where things are going and provide real feedback on priorities. 

4. Keep up the community engagement. It has been great to have so many members of the IOHK team available to answer questions on here and to engage the community.

All I can say is - I sincerely hope Cardano/IOHK/etc aren't relying on these countdown clocks as the sole source of excitement for the community. No hype needed, but some sense of what will actually make this special needs to be made clear - and I don't mean consensus algorithms - only cryptonerds care about that kind of thing. We do need actual investors to buy in and prepare to stake. Heck, we need staking to actually be possible for people to see value because that's all we've got at the moment.

Your point is well taken that we should not want a system that requires creating new blockchains to solve every problem, and that is precisely why Cardano is a positive evolution of blockchain tech in many ways.  It provides the adaptability and flexibility across the whole platform so that new blockchains are not needed to solve problems, the modifications can be made without forking the settlement layer (main blockchain) by placing the smart contracts and programmatic coding languages in the computational layer which would not require modifying the PoS algorithm or the blockchain itself to do so.

Speaking after his presentation, Professor Kiayias said: “We’re very happy that we had the opportunity to present Ouroboros at the conference. The protocol and especially its security analysis were very well received by fellow cryptographers.”

“Our next steps will be to focus on the next version of the protocol, Ouroboros Praos which improves even further the security and performance characteristics of the protocol.”

The Ouroboros protocol stands out as the first proof of stake algorithm that is provably secure, meaning that it offers security guarantees that are mathematically proven. This is essential for a protocol that is intended to be used in cryptocurrency, an infrastructure that must be relied on to carry billions of dollars worth of value. In addition to security, if blockchains are going to become infrastructure for new financial systems they must be able to comfortably handle millions of users. The key to scaling up is proof of stake, a far more energy efficient and cost effective algorithm, and as such this research represents a significant step forward in cryptography.

NEO already has this.

   Python, Go

&gt;  It will also utilise a hardware component in smart phones that will give it the best wallet security.       
     
Not sure if NEO has this, but it's something that can easily be done.     
       
   
&gt; Also its POS algorithm has been peer reviewed and so is known to be secure.       
     
NEO has a better system already. NEO actually works like a share in the network and all NEO holders get paid in GAS based on network usage. essentially paying dividends like a stock.    
unlike PoS this won't cause inflation of the asset.       
   
   
&gt; Next year it will also have a feature that makes it quantum secure.     
   
NEO has Quantum resistant algorithms already.          
     

&gt; It is also based on a scientific philosophy which is hugely important. It also has the best governance system that will allow it to be upgraded without causing chaos.      
         
I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean.

I must say at the outset:
1) I have enjoyed watching and listening to Charles Hoskinson over the past couple of years (youTube and so on) - impressive, persuasive.
2) I hold no ADA, so have no skin in the game. However, I hold a few ETCs, so I have some interest.

I have little doubt that Charles was involved with ""Cardano Gaming Group"" (see icedbeverage comment elsewhere, or follow directly here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZqIeZQXHk published by Attain Corporation, 21 Dec 2015).
I commend icedbeverage for his comment: ""This is not fud these are valid concerns. [This video has] ... Hoskinson in them and they talk about a gaming platform. We need to know the full history and if there was anything sketchy or fraudulent.""

By some accounts at the time (about July/ August 2016), CARDANO ADA coin from Cardano Gaming Group somehow failed to deliver and left many Japanese who had invested in it disgruntled (see note 1 below). 

Wukifnee: if you are one of the (allegedly) disgruntled investors, I sympathize.
 
To anyone who is concerned, my advice is do your own research, don't waste time and energy letting off steam on reddit or elsewhere.

By the way, there is a company ""CGG Limited"" registered in the Isle of Man, previously named ""Cardano Gaming Group Limited"" and previous to that ""Cardano Limited"" - documents available for download for a modest fee at https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=331585

The Isle of Man info above may be a red herring, however on the face of it, it may be worth looking into, if you're so inclined/ motivated.

I have marginal concerns myself about the back-story of Cardano in general and Charles in particular , but I do not have enough skin in the game to warrant conducting a proper investigation, which would involve (inter-alia) searching japanese language websites in a focussed way.

So do your research wukifnee, contact others, try and build a case and if/ when you feel you have one, apply your information wisely. I wish you good luck.

,[deleted],,,,"Hey there BTCLOGO....  

First and foremost I kindly request that you google IOHK and visit their website, this is the company that is developing Cardano along with various other extremely well reputed establishments which you would be able to gain further insight into if you do further investigations via the internet from the resources at hand.

Now visit Youtube, search Cardano and take the time to do an in depth assessment of all posts from various parties involved in the project, as well as independent reviews from various different Youtuber's.

Now visit all the reviews and news posts from various different websites which are really easy to find if you do the neccesary search via your favourite search engine.

If you are able to take the time to go through all the information at hand, which I propose all investors do prior to making an investment of any kind, you will come to see just who you are dealing with and the scope for huge progress in many different regards relating to the Cardano project and the ADA coin.

I could go on and on promoting Cardano and for so many different reasons, however the fact of the matter is that everyone has to do their own investigations and come up with their own conclusion, and on that note my personal conclusion is as follows:

1.  These guys are 100% transparent and professional and this is made very clear through the Cardano website in the form of audit and regular progress reports which are made available to the public.
2.  The Cardano team and associates involved with the development of the product extend cross border, within the region of 6 different countries having individuals involved and their collective intelligence as a team is in my opinion beyond astounding.
3.  Key players in the Cardano team have loads of experience in the crypto currency environment from their past endeavours and they know exactly what needs to be done in order to take the game to the next level and on a macro global level and most importantly, just how to do it.
4.  The Cardano roadmap is clear and they know exactly where they're going and what needs to be done in order to achieve their objectives and this information is available for all to see.
5.  If these guys say they have technology that is revoutionary and they're in the process of rolling it out, you need to know that it is very real and you can have peace of mind in this regard.
6.  There are so many crypto coins out there, so many lies, so many promises so much hot air, so many scams, sooo much deceit and I am of the certain belief that in the most positive of ways, Cardano stands way out from 85% of the market, based on credentials and the level of credibility that the key players, developers and the rest of their team have earned thus far.

The world needs to come to Cardano, the world needs to embrace the sound ethics of Cardano, the world will come to see the strength of this amazing endeavour and I strongly urge all to partake in this awesome opportunity.   ADA is here and it's the future of crypto, mark my words.  You can be a fly on the wall or you can reach for the sky... Cardano is going to take us there and if you snooze, you loose ;)

Networking, and forging forward in strong partnerships with the right establishments, is going to help set the ADA ball rolling big time. The Cardano team are by no means a clown operation, they do have serious plans and whoever doesn't come to the Cardano party, buy and hold ADA, will be kicking themselves in time to come.

The face of Cardano - Charles H. is being active on social media answering questions and sharing updates. I like this guy, but that’s just me.

I have seen a few trolls bashing the f*ck out of Charles H. with some stupid article they found online and using it to question his intentions with Cardano. You can find conversations on Twitter and reddit.

The roadmap release a few days ago was ok. Some expected the price of Ada to skyrocket and it didn’t. It is all about the investor(actually trader mostly) sentiment, and not many were convinced that the roadmap was good. I really don’t know what they expected. A roadmap is a freakin roadmap. It was just fine. And Charles H. did an interview that was out one day before the road map, talking about it.

I believe I exhausted the internet and any information that is out there regarding the Cardano project, and my conclusion is this is a hands down legitimate project. And it doesn’t take a genius to work that out.

Well done to everyone, devs, brains, heavy lifters, investors, speculators, supporters, haters, trolls.

Of its many innovations, Cardano is the first blockchain to use a provably secure, proof of stake algorithm - the only one to have been academically peer reviewed by leading cryptographers through its acceptance to Crypto 2017, the world’s top cryptography [conference.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amycastor/2017/08/23/at-crypto-2017-blockchain-presentations-focus-on-proofs-not-concepts/#35d474f67b70. ) 

Cardano has also been written from scratch in Haskell. It allows the use of a high assurance technique called formal verification. This produces evidence that code is correct and could have helped safeguard against the flaws that lead to the DAO hack.

Ultimately it's difficult to adapt blockchains to make them fit for specific applications or use cases. That's why Cardano was designed and built from scratch in Haskell code to be a highly secure blockchain. It allows formal verification of code, and easy extensibility through a layered architecture.

The vast majority of IOHK (engineering company co-founded by Charles) resources are devoted towards developing Cardano, but they also work on ETC. They are not competing projects per se, as Cardano has a completely different architecture, with the world's first provably secure PoS algorithm Ouroboros driving it. IOHK is contracted to work on Cardano till at least 2020 and may well be working on Cardano much longer.

The projects are not in direct competition, and Cardano benefits from the expertise learnt by IOHK in their work on ETC.

EOS has high inflation throughout it's lifetime. Until the ICO ends, 2m coins will be added to the supply on a daily basis and once the ICO is over, the new blockchain will continue to emit new coins at a fast pace in order to keep transactions for users free.

If you want more evidence, look at Dan Larimer's previous two projects. Bitshares and Steem. Both have high inflation and none of them made investors any money. Over the years they have ballooned in marketcap but price has remained the same. What makes you think EOS will be any different?

EOS also will not have anywhere near 2 billion in cash. They got most of their contribution in the first few days. After that the ICO has seen nothing but wash trades by recycling their own ETH to keep the price propped up. This is trade manipulation but it's not like there is any blockchain police to apprehend them.

Dan Larimer also has a history of abandoning his old projects and hopping on to a new one after he has delivered the basic v1.0 of the platform. What makes you think he won't do the same with EOS?

All I can say is - I sincerely hope Cardano/IOHK/etc aren't relying on these countdown clocks as the sole source of excitement for the community.

So we have to value Cardano in two ways. One is the platform, which I think will be great and used by organizations. The other thing is the currency currency implemented (ADA).

- How does Cardano compare in terms of scalability and privacy with other projects?

For ""other projects"" take Ethereum as the comparison, perhaps before and after the upcoming upgrades (Metropolis, PoS/PoW, integration with Zcash, i.e. ZoE, polkadot.)

But yeah, it helps if it does not drop in my salary terms.

Cardano is still a very young system. They are currently developing only one module of the several that will eventually build their platform. The coin is worth its current price, no more. Any spike is based on expectations, and competition is tough out there, every month you get new projects solving new problems. So hype will eventually be compensated with realizations of lack of maturity and interest in other projects.

It is an interesting coin, and it seems to be developing a good community around which adds pressure to the buy side.

I saw mentions about Cardano Labo in Slack, so I will explain here about Cardano Labs (or Labo).

Cardano Labo was originally a project started by Japanese businessmen who knew of the project early on and were big fans of the Cardano vision. They wanted to build a blockchain solution on Cardano when the computation layer was completed, however due to delays in development, Cardano Labo decided to proceed with other protocols and change its corporate name to Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore the possibilities of developing applications with multiple platforms, then eventually became a major player in the Vietnamese blockchain community.
There is no commercial or capital affiliation between Cardano Labo and any of the Cardano project entities to this date.
With the Cardano Computation Layer drawing near, Emurgo has been in contact with Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore possibilities of collaboration to develop DApps and smart contracts on Cardano. We are excited about the possibility to work with Infinity Blockchain Labs as they have established a strong presence and reputation in the Vietnamese blockchain and fintech industries.

,TenaciousJai,,,,"The problems that Cardano solves are those that plague the major currencies, primarily the ability to scale properly into future growth while adding on new functionality and volume in a flexible way without the requirements of forking the original chain or relying on extremely difficult consensus soft fork agreements to fix problems that are were not anticipated in the original code, but are inextricably linked to the core code causing battles over how to solve the problem that damage the value of the currency (obvious examples are BTC/BCH and ETH / ETC (which is another project of input output HK, fyi)).
Cardano resolves these problems by separating the main chain settlement layer from the computational layer, allowing the smart contracts to sit outside of the chain until the transaction is finalized and then written to the settlement layer blockchain. This prevents most of the scalability issues, because the bulk of the work is done outside of the main chain, and any updates to the computational layer can be made without breaking the original chain, including adding new coding languages, etc. Yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum are developing addon projects to do similar things, but the fact that they're addons is a symptom of the problem Cardano is attempting to solve by developing the platform from the ground up to account for the unknown knowns, and the unknown unknowns that might arise in the future.
Bitcoin and Ethereum both have massive scalability issues - bitcoin currently sits at 10-12 tx /sec capacity which is causing factions to fork the chain to solve growing pains and the development of several patches to resolve the issue including a sidechain project (lightning network) to accommodate the needs of the platform, Ethereum has similar load issues which have already forced them to develop another entire project (Raiden) to allow for growth only a couple of years into the roadmap, and it's uncertain how their Proof of Stake system will hold up when PoW ends in a few months since they're only just now releasing Metropolis. Cardano aims to start the platform integrating all of the solutions various coins have come up with into one platform, so that the usability and functionality are scalable, flexible, and predictable well into the future. Something that causes endless headaches for most other currencies that don't have a long-term vision for their development from the start, but rather rely on ad-hoc patching to fix issues as they run into problems along the way.

&gt; But why did you say:
&gt;&gt; some are also published in journals

/u/ethereumcharles didn't - I did. Charles is not me, and I (as I wrote) am not associated with Cardano or IOHK. I haphazardly used the concept of journal publishing as an overarching concept, that's my bad. Replace the word 'journal' with 'computer science conference' and the same thing applies similarly, as Charles has mentioned also.

To answer one of your original questions in the OP, peer review results are not published anywhere I've ever seen. If you are peer-reviewed as part of submitting a paper to a conference or journal, you usually receive feedback in the form of anonymized meta-reviewers, and that feedback is not meant to be publicized. Doing so would probably get your paper rejected instantly. The paper is revised based on the feedback (or not) and depending on need, and then either plain accepted or rejected in a follow-up round. Some conferences abide by this kind of approval process, others are simply accept/reject based on review. Peer review is not like auditing; in auditing, the result is the audit itself, which should be read. In review, the result is that either the paper is accepted (stamp of approval) or rejected. It's a filtering mechanism, whereby there is a greater probability that you can trust the work of the papers that make it through the filter.

Of course, you should still use sound scientific process and check the authors of the paper, what else they've published, read the articles and see what and who they cite, and check whether anyone else has cited the article itself yet (unlikely for new, bleeding-edge things). You should check their academic background, and what they're hired to do as researcherrs. You'll have to do all that on your own time, though, not going to do that for you :) If you did all of the above, you'd find that the papers Cardano produces are generally of a good, sound and academic quality and most other papers in the crypto space are cringeworthy for any academic to read in comparison. This bodes well for the space as a whole, and hopefully it catches on elsewhere too, so we can collectively push for higher standards. 

This isn't to say that Cardano is the _only_ place producing sound quality papers in crypto, at all. There are some very solid ones floating around that don't seem appropriate to mention here. The norm, however, looks like a bachelor's students first year at University or below - which is striking when you think about how much money some of those (white)papers raise subsequently!",True,,,,0,1511196826,,1511197027,0,dq3icp5,False,t3_7dzlvt,t1_dq3aota,1512836211,2,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7dzlvt/since_cardano_puts_so_much_emphasis_on_using/dq3icp5/,,public

Maybe he was having an horrible day and if that s the case... on the wise words of Anthony demello... _ ""I m an ass, you are an ass... now let s get over it! ""

First and foremost I kindly request that you google IOHK and visit their website, this is the company that is developing Cardano along with various other extremely well reputed establishments which you would be able to gain further insight into if you do further investigations via the internet from the resources at hand.

Now visit Youtube, search Cardano and take the time to do an in depth assessment of all posts from various parties involved in the project, as well as independent reviews from various different Youtuber's.

Now visit all the reviews and news posts from various different websites which are really easy to find if you do the neccesary search via your favourite search engine.

If you are able to take the time to go through all the information at hand, which I propose all investors do prior to making an investment of any kind, you will come to see just who you are dealing with and the scope for huge progress in many different regards relating to the Cardano project and the ADA coin.

I could go on and on promoting Cardano and for so many different reasons, however the fact of the matter is that everyone has to do their own investigations and come up with their own conclusion, and on that note my personal conclusion is as follows:

1.  These guys are 100% transparent and professional and this is made very clear through the Cardano website in the form of audit and regular progress reports which are made available to the public.
2.  The Cardano team and associates involved with the development of the product extend cross border, within the region of 6 different countries having individuals involved and their collective intelligence as a team is in my opinion beyond astounding.
3.  Key players in the Cardano team have loads of experience in the crypto currency environment from their past endeavours and they know exactly what needs to be done in order to take the game to the next level and on a macro global level and most importantly, just how to do it.
4.  The Cardano roadmap is clear and they know exactly where they're going and what needs to be done in order to achieve their objectives and this information is available for all to see.
5.  If these guys say they have technology that is revoutionary and they're in the process of rolling it out, you need to know that it is very real and you can have peace of mind in this regard.
6.  There are so many crypto coins out there, so many lies, so many promises so much hot air, so many scams, sooo much deceit and I am of the certain belief that in the most positive of ways, Cardano stands way out from 85% of the market, based on credentials and the level of credibility that the key players, developers and the rest of their team have earned thus far.

The world needs to come to Cardano, the world needs to embrace the sound ethics of Cardano, the world will come to see the strength of this amazing endeavour and I strongly urge all to partake in this awesome opportunity.   ADA is here and it's the future of crypto, mark my words.  You can be a fly on the wall or you can reach for the sky... Cardano is going to take us there and if you snooze, you loose ;)

- Built with Haskell, allowing formal verification of a lot of core aspects of the blockchain. This is important! As an example, IOHK also built a formal verification system for the Ethereum VM (KEVM), and found several errors in the EVM. Errors in the core aspects of the blockchain are bad news bears.

- IOHK are either employing or cooperating with Well Typed, one of the world's leading Haskell consultancies.

- IOHK researchers include some of the world's top minds within programming language research and algorithmic game theory. Outside of Microsoft and IBM's initiatives (and I have no idea who they enlist), I have yet to see any blockchain that has even remotely close to this level of academic research power. In practice what this means is that what they are building will come across as, and indeed probably be, a lot more trustworthy. This is work backed up by serious research and good ideas, not just good ideas.

The primary assumption going wrong in peoples mind, I find, is that existing blockchain products are 'good enough'. They're great ideas, but they are rudimentary and basic; they are the first steps. Nothing wrong with this, mind. We're going to see a LOT of evolution in this area, not just from Cardano/IOHK, but also from Hyperledger and other initiatives. 

As a programmer and academic, some of the choices Ethereum (and consequently also NEO) has made wrt. the way the scripting language and VMs work deeply puzzle me, making compile-time verification of contracts very hard, making the attack surface of the VM extremely large, and in general just making it very, very easy to make mistakes. This can and already has led to a LOT of problems, i.e., people losing a lot of money. Importantly, this weakens trust in the contract language. At the same time, academia has worked on contract languages for dozens of years now - so there's really no need to re-invent the wheel to such a degree.

,cardanojohn,,,,"Cardano does currently have a very high Asian participation. Thats because the project was germinated from the idea that the Asian market was ripe and open for new financial stack and had not been saturated by cryptocurrencies like the west. A cryptocurrency that succeeded in this might go onto transforming developing regions by offering those who are ignored by traditional banks blockchain enabled financial services. 

Then from a regulatory perspective as well, there are benefits to Cardano from having done the pre-sale in countries where there is no question of whether such a sale is legitimate. With no US participation in the sale, it also alleviates some of the SEC pressures which other cryptocurrencies have faced by performing ICO’s with Americans. The sale was performed by a Japanese entity who performed detailed KYC checks. This means they knew the difference between the amount of transactions and people. So for example, there were roughly 14K transactions that occurred over different tranches. With other cryptocurrencies, 8k of those could have been from a single person, creating a huge inequality in distribution. With Cardano we know that 9,912 people that participated, because they all went through compliance.

Cardano is not unique in having a geographic centre for its pre sale, Filecoin which was 100% US. What started in Asia, has now become global. You have an opportunity to purchase tokens on Bittrex and soon a number of other exchanges. Cardano is focused on become an industrial strength blockchain that can operate in regulated industries. The way in which the sale was performed with KYC and compliance will only be helpful to that aspiration.

&gt; But why did you say:
&gt;&gt; some are also published in journals

/u/ethereumcharles didn't - I did. Charles is not me, and I (as I wrote) am not associated with Cardano or IOHK. I haphazardly used the concept of journal publishing as an overarching concept, that's my bad. Replace the word 'journal' with 'computer science conference' and the same thing applies similarly, as Charles has mentioned also.

To answer one of your original questions in the OP, peer review results are not published anywhere I've ever seen. If you are peer-reviewed as part of submitting a paper to a conference or journal, you usually receive feedback in the form of anonymized meta-reviewers, and that feedback is not meant to be publicized. Doing so would probably get your paper rejected instantly. The paper is revised based on the feedback (or not) and depending on need, and then either plain accepted or rejected in a follow-up round. Some conferences abide by this kind of approval process, others are simply accept/reject based on review. Peer review is not like auditing; in auditing, the result is the audit itself, which should be read. In review, the result is that either the paper is accepted (stamp of approval) or rejected. It's a filtering mechanism, whereby there is a greater probability that you can trust the work of the papers that make it through the filter.

Of course, you should still use sound scientific process and check the authors of the paper, what else they've published, read the articles and see what and who they cite, and check whether anyone else has cited the article itself yet (unlikely for new, bleeding-edge things). You should check their academic background, and what they're hired to do as researcherrs. You'll have to do all that on your own time, though, not going to do that for you :) If you did all of the above, you'd find that the papers Cardano produces are generally of a good, sound and academic quality and most other papers in the crypto space are cringeworthy for any academic to read in comparison. This bodes well for the space as a whole, and hopefully it catches on elsewhere too, so we can collectively push for higher standards. 

This isn't to say that Cardano is the _only_ place producing sound quality papers in crypto, at all. There are some very solid ones floating around that don't seem appropriate to mention here. The norm, however, looks like a bachelor's students first year at University or below - which is striking when you think about how much money some of those (white)papers raise subsequently!",True,,,,0,1511196826,,1511197027,0,dq3icp5,False,t3_7dzlvt,t1_dq3aota,1512836211,2,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/7dzlvt/since_cardano_puts_so_much_emphasis_on_using/dq3icp5/,,public

,[deleted],,,,"Hey there BTCLOGO....  

First and foremost I kindly request that you google IOHK and visit their website, this is the company that is developing Cardano along with various other extremely well reputed establishments which you would be able to gain further insight into if you do further investigations via the internet from the resources at hand.

Now visit Youtube, search Cardano and take the time to do an in depth assessment of all posts from various parties involved in the project, as well as independent reviews from various different Youtuber's.

Now visit all the reviews and news posts from various different websites which are really easy to find if you do the neccesary search via your favourite search engine.

If you are able to take the time to go through all the information at hand, which I propose all investors do prior to making an investment of any kind, you will come to see just who you are dealing with and the scope for huge progress in many different regards relating to the Cardano project and the ADA coin.

I could go on and on promoting Cardano and for so many different reasons, however the fact of the matter is that everyone has to do their own investigations and come up with their own conclusion, and on that note my personal conclusion is as follows:

1.  These guys are 100% transparent and professional and this is made very clear through the Cardano website in the form of audit and regular progress reports which are made available to the public.
2.  The Cardano team and associates involved with the development of the product extend cross border, within the region of 6 different countries having individuals involved and their collective intelligence as a team is in my opinion beyond astounding.
3.  Key players in the Cardano team have loads of experience in the crypto currency environment from their past endeavours and they know exactly what needs to be done in order to take the game to the next level and on a macro global level and most importantly, just how to do it.
4.  The Cardano roadmap is clear and they know exactly where they're going and what needs to be done in order to achieve their objectives and this information is available for all to see.
5.  If these guys say they have technology that is revoutionary and they're in the process of rolling it out, you need to know that it is very real and you can have peace of mind in this regard.
6.  There are so many crypto coins out there, so many lies, so many promises so much hot air, so many scams, sooo much deceit and I am of the certain belief that in the most positive of ways, Cardano stands way out from 85% of the market, based on credentials and the level of credibility that the key players, developers and the rest of their team have earned thus far.

The world needs to come to Cardano, the world needs to embrace the sound ethics of Cardano, the world will come to see the strength of this amazing endeavour and I strongly urge all to partake in this awesome opportunity.   ADA is here and it's the future of crypto, mark my words.  You can be a fly on the wall or you can reach for the sky... Cardano is going to take us there and if you snooze, you loose ;)

,RayMetz100,,,,"Look at the top 5 stocks as an example.  What were the top 5 stocks 5 years ago?  Notice how all 5 went up together.  Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.  You will miss all the new coins and find your old #70-100 collection became an average of #120.

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

Cardano is being built by IOHK, a leading technology company. Their international team of leading experts, academics and cryptographers have built Cardano during the past two years, inspired by the best features of existing cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum. Of its many innovations, Cardano is the first blockchain to use a provably secure, proof of stake algorithm - the only one to have been academically peer reviewed by leading cryptographers through its acceptance to Crypto 2017, the world’s top cryptography [conference.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amycastor/2017/08/23/at-crypto-2017-blockchain-presentations-focus-on-proofs-not-concepts/#35d474f67b70. ) 

Cardano has also been written from scratch in Haskell. It allows the use of a high assurance technique called formal verification. This produces evidence that code is correct and could have helped safeguard against the flaws that lead to the DAO hack.

,demetrius2012,,,,"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The roadmap provided alot of what people expected, and few surprises - this is fine from my point of view. There are a few areas I would consider working on moving forward: 

1. Make interviews/videos shorter. There are too many 45 minute videos explaining exactly the same thing about ADA (and frankly, with too much fluff on 3rd gen blockchain and not enough emphasis on quick comparisons of how ADA shakes up the market). Give people 5 minute clips and make this feel accessible. For instance, if you release a roadmap and have a month where no software is being released and just a countdown clock is running, I would think you could take each of the key sections of that section of the roadmap and build out a small series of 5 minute videos explaining why each component matters, and emphasize why each release must occur in that specific order for ADA to succeed. The team is doing advanced stuff and the general public simply doesn't understand all of it - make the value proposition more tangible (i.e. sure, we could release smart contracts tomorrow, but that would lead to x,y,z so it must be done like this). Shorter videos allow systematic deconstruction of invalid points and time to assess where value creation is occurring - for Cardano, alot of that value creation is in the way it is being developed and this is super intangible to ""normal people"" despite its importance. 

2. If you don't find a way of building off the roadmap each month through video explanations of each section, or weekly questions on each portion of the roadmap, then I honestly think you should drop the countdown clock. It doesn't mean anything other than hype and I am not a fan of coins with verbal hype and no releases to back it up. A website with no release dates and generic time frames that are 6 months out aren't too helpful with a coin this new. I think guaranteed quarterly or 6 month software releases would be more meaningful. 

3. If you keep up the the roadmaps, release more information. A roadmap changes, sure. But inviting the community to comment on something where we don't even actually know where you are headed, makes it difficult to provide feedback. Every decision has a ripple effect. We are looking at a small snapshot of the ADA vision, so how can we say whether or not this first section of the roadmap is appropriate or not since we don't know how it is meant to plug in to the future releases? I think a minimum of a 1 year vision should be in a roadmap so the community can actually see where things are going and provide real feedback on priorities. 

4. Keep up the community engagement. It has been great to have so many members of the IOHK team available to answer questions on here and to engage the community.

And another good news here,,,the BIG project with the university of Illinois proceeded for 15  years funded by NASA, BOEING, TOYOTA and so on...IOHK just joined it in order to proceed the project together about next generation virtual machine that will be available for the blockchain security!

If you were to sell 1 of the 5 pieces, you would sell it for 1/5 the price of a whole apple. So the price of buying 5 pieces of apple is the same as just buying a whole apple. Just because there is more ""supply"" or pieces in the market, does not mean that the total value is lower. Basically the sum  of the parts will equal the whole, no matter how many parts there are. So if Cardano provides economic value to people worth 1 billion dollars, you could either have 1 token worth $1 billion or 1 billion tokens worth $1. Either way, the total value of all the tokens is $1 billion. I don't know if that made it any clearer but thought I would give it a shot.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"First of all, I applaud wanting to understand both NEO and Cardano. Unfortunately, the amount of misinformation in this thread and amongst most redditers is staggering; and you're going to get the wrong read on what's actually true if you do that by reading off a laundry list of what is being touted as 'rumored features'. You are going to have to read up on what the blockchains _actually_ support now and here, what they _say_ they are going to support, and then try and assess whether you think its likely they will succeed. And that can be very hard to do, because it sometimes involves digging into code, or knowing enough math to closely read the whitepapers and identify when vague bullshit statements appear with no backing.

For example: Both NEO and Cardano use proof-of-stake based consensus algorithms. Both NEO and Cardano currently own all of the consensus nodes, i.e., they technically dictate the truth on the blockchain right now (centralized). The difference? NEO's consensus algorithm has changed theory multiple times, and they still haven't settled on one that will effectively protect the network against a range of attacks - that should worry you; they also have no official timeline on when they will let others run staking nodes - that should also worry you. Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is peer-reviewed, meaning at least some portion of incredibly smart cryptographers have looked over its theory and agreed that it survives scientific review - i.e., you can trust that at least the math and theory behind it seems somewhat solid; Cardano has an announced timeline, after which the 'bootstrap era' will end and other staking nodes will be able to run - 3 months from now approximately.

On the surface those two situations look similar, but there is a _huge_ difference. You will run into the same thing with the code execution you're talking about; on the surface it looks like both NEO and Cardano allow running code on the blockchain. But the approaches taken are night and day. Saying they basically 'both do this', is like saying that any two vehicles are the same because they both drive on roads - whether it's a horse cart, ferrari or a truck.

Cardano and other blockchains face a huge challenge in trying to communicate some of these things effectively, because even as an MSc in Computer Science and someone who's spending a good amount of hours looking into these things on a daily basis, it's hard for me to follow and decipher what's up and down.",True,,,,0,1507931880,,1507932305,0,dobzva2,False,t3_763rjd,t1_dobbh81,1509806465,14,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/763rjd/how_does_cardanao_compare_to_eth_neo_and_ark_etc/dobzva2/,,

In the crypto market there are many project. They have the same vision of a better economy and this is the point.

We have to thinking in a new way of coevolution and diversity.

I think there are many projects if they grow the hole ecosystem grows and Cardano is one of them.

I saw mentions about Cardano Labo in Slack, so I will explain here about Cardano Labs (or Labo).

Cardano Labo was originally a project started by Japanese businessmen who knew of the project early on and were big fans of the Cardano vision. They wanted to build a blockchain solution on Cardano when the computation layer was completed, however due to delays in development, Cardano Labo decided to proceed with other protocols and change its corporate name to Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore the possibilities of developing applications with multiple platforms, then eventually became a major player in the Vietnamese blockchain community.
There is no commercial or capital affiliation between Cardano Labo and any of the Cardano project entities to this date.
With the Cardano Computation Layer drawing near, Emurgo has been in contact with Infinity Blockchain Labs to explore possibilities of collaboration to develop DApps and smart contracts on Cardano. We are excited about the possibility to work with Infinity Blockchain Labs as they have established a strong presence and reputation in the Vietnamese blockchain and fintech industries.

,GreenTreeTrader,,,,"First of all, I applaud wanting to understand both NEO and Cardano. Unfortunately, the amount of misinformation in this thread and amongst most redditers is staggering; and you're going to get the wrong read on what's actually true if you do that by reading off a laundry list of what is being touted as 'rumored features'. You are going to have to read up on what the blockchains _actually_ support now and here, what they _say_ they are going to support, and then try and assess whether you think its likely they will succeed. And that can be very hard to do, because it sometimes involves digging into code, or knowing enough math to closely read the whitepapers and identify when vague bullshit statements appear with no backing.

For example: Both NEO and Cardano use proof-of-stake based consensus algorithms. Both NEO and Cardano currently own all of the consensus nodes, i.e., they technically dictate the truth on the blockchain right now (centralized). The difference? NEO's consensus algorithm has changed theory multiple times, and they still haven't settled on one that will effectively protect the network against a range of attacks - that should worry you; they also have no official timeline on when they will let others run staking nodes - that should also worry you. Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is peer-reviewed, meaning at least some portion of incredibly smart cryptographers have looked over its theory and agreed that it survives scientific review - i.e., you can trust that at least the math and theory behind it seems somewhat solid; Cardano has an announced timeline, after which the 'bootstrap era' will end and other staking nodes will be able to run - 3 months from now approximately.

On the surface those two situations look similar, but there is a _huge_ difference. You will run into the same thing with the code execution you're talking about; on the surface it looks like both NEO and Cardano allow running code on the blockchain. But the approaches taken are night and day. Saying they basically 'both do this', is like saying that any two vehicles are the same because they both drive on roads - whether it's a horse cart, ferrari or a truck.

Cardano and other blockchains face a huge challenge in trying to communicate some of these things effectively, because even as an MSc in Computer Science and someone who's spending a good amount of hours looking into these things on a daily basis, it's hard for me to follow and decipher what's up and down.",True,,,,0,1507931880,,1507932305,0,dobzva2,False,t3_763rjd,t1_dobbh81,1509806465,14,False,cardano,t5_3jns3,/r/cardano/comments/763rjd/how_does_cardanao_compare_to_eth_neo_and_ark_etc/dobzva2/,,

,RayMetz100,,,,"Look at the top 5 stocks as an example.  What were the top 5 stocks 5 years ago?  Notice how all 5 went up together.  Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.  You will miss all the new coins and find your old #70-100 collection became an average of #120.

They’ll ask to use the platform for their own currency. That doesn’t mean ADA won’t have a value of its own on the side. But don’t expect it to become the de facto nor de jure currency of say Japan.

So we have to value Cardano in two ways. One is the platform, which I think will be great and used by organizations. The other thing is the currency currency implemented (ADA).

That Cardano was developed elsewhere on a certain date? 

That Cardano was copied/forked from Cardano Labo? 

That Cardano was developed as a gaming platform initially? 

You are going to have to be specific here. And here's how you can word it, in case you don't know how to conduct a proper investigation -- which I think is the intention here. To obfuscate and confuse...muddy the waters.

Add references to evidence that support your specific, identifiable and reasonable conclusions. 

Example: (Here is the evidence.) 

Exhibit A: Affidavit from CEO John Doe attesting that he originally financed the development of Cardano Labo, before Cardano existed. 

Exhibit B: YouTube video certified as original (unedited) of CFO Sam Doe, Cardano Labo, dated January X, 2016, indicating he actually created Cardano Labo in China at XYZ Labs three years before Hoshkinson did;  

Exhibit C: A Cardano Labo Github pull request from ""ethereumcharles"" showing that on February X, 201X, Cardano was forked from Cardano Labo.

This isn't just another random Ethereum shit token with a vague whitepaper.  They have been building the platform for several years now.  Here is a good summary of one of the components of the platform:

""Cardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.""

,RayMetz100,,,,"Look at the top 5 stocks as an example.  What were the top 5 stocks 5 years ago?  Notice how all 5 went up together.  Some go faster and some slower, and they do change places, but in general, when the lead stock goes up, so do the followers.  Cardano will need features to attract more investment if it wants to move up, just like the nomber 5 stock.  I think of the top 100 coins like a slinky.  They are all related.  Sometimes BTC moves faster than coin #100, sometimes slower.  If you track the ratio of the sum of top x coins to coin number 100, or 50, or 20, year over year, you will notice the slinky gets consistently more compressed each year.  If you compare the coin market to stocks, you will notice stock number 100 is way closer to the top x stocks as compared to crypto.  Since crypto is so much easier to create and copy compared to corporations or stocks, I personally expect coin number 100 to be closer to the top 5 than stock number 100 is, but that may take 10+ years.  Lastly, just because the slinky is compressing and number 100 generally grows faster than number 1-5, it doesn't always mean the smaller market cap coin values went up.  Look at the top 100 coins and count how many of them were added to the market in the last year.  You can't simply buy 20 coins #70-100, wait a year and see your investment moved faster than BTC.  You will miss all the new coins and find your old #70-100 collection became an average of #120.
